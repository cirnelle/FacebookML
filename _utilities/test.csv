Illuminated Eye  On January 17  2015  European Space Agency astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti tweeted these spectacular photographs of lightning illuminating the eye of Cyclone Bansi as it churned over the Indian Ocean. When Cristoforetti captured the images  Bansi appeared to be the equivalent of a category 4 hurricane.

Marzuq Sand Sea  Libya  This sand sea is one of the most recognizable features for orbiting astronauts  partly because they see it often through cloudless Saharan skies. Read more at http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=84970&src=fb  (re-uploaded image to correct typo), HER, photo

Best of the Archives: Auroral Rocket in Norway  The aurora borealis and aurora australis—the northern and southern lights—are visible manifestations of a connection between the Sun and Earth. Blasts of energy and magnetically charged particles from the Sun are constantly flowing out into space and crashing into the magnetic fields of Earth and other planets. That energy stirs up the particles and energy trapped in Earth’s space  or magnetosphere  creating the auroras and disturbing the upper reaches of our atmosphere. Photographers captured this spectacular photograph of a four-stage Black Brant XII sounding rocket and the aurora borealis (inset) four years ago on December 12  2010  during the NASA-funded Rocket Experiment for Neutral Upwelling (RENU). The rocket was launched from Andøya Rocket Range near Andenes  Norway  and carried instruments about 200 miles (320 kilometers) into the atmosphere to observe the aurora and the associated flow of heat  particles  and electromagnetic energy. The photograph of the aurora was taken from the Kjell Henrickson Observatory in Svalbard  which was under the apogee  or peak  of the rocket’s arc through the sky. The rocket landed in the ocean about 900 miles (1450 km) from the launch site.
