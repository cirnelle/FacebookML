We also don't need to "assume" that Climate Change is a huge priority. It is.   It's not an assumption when it's based on a Global Scientific Consensus based on mountains of independently verifiable evidence.   It's not an assumption that hundreds of millions of people living in costal areas will be displaced if we allow all the ice to melt.   It's not an assumption that we will experience greater droughts  heat waves  flooding  and more intense storm systems as atmospheric carbon dioxide levels continue to increase.   It's not an assumption that the greenhouse effect is real. It's not an assumption that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. It's not an assumption that we're pumping billions of tons of it into the atmosphere every year.

And you could have regulatory organizations (who could be paid by taxes) that go and enforce emission output by companies and cities. There are plenty of ways to implement taxes to benefit our clean energy gathering and regulate emissions into our atmosphere

Why the pushback? Overpopulation is also a huge issue - we are destroying our home. That should concern all of us.

Currently  the recorded cores  yes...   however the potential ice cores to be drilled in Antarctica hold 1.5 Million years of history.   Somehow I was mixing those figures and the stratigraphy at the Grand Canyon.. I was sure it was at least in the million range..   At any rate  ice cores aren't the only source of Climate Data... Geologically  we have Hundreds of Millions of years of data.. going all the way back before the Precambrian.

CLIMATE SCIENTISTS  of all political persuasions  and nationalities base the exponential rise in the GMST on industrialization ( specifically fossil fuel burning)  having studied records going back several hundreds of thousands of years. The natural climate forcings have been shown to correlate to various cycles of warming and cooling prior to that. Scientists have shown that  subtracting all human activity so only the natural forcings are in play would currently produce a slight COOLING effect. However the warming is real  measurable and therefore the result of human activity.  100 000 years ago there was no industrial activity hence your arguments utter banality

It has some bad effects. Global timescale (the whole 150 vs 4 billion year argument you pointed out) is irrelevant when you consider that even if these trends were 'normal'  climate change endangers lives  habitats  environments  the ground we walk on  etc...  Oh and if for some reason you don't care about earth or the lives of others  global warming puts a massive dent in the economy

But with climate science  people suddenly feel like their home cooked opinion should be given equal credit when compared to the best scientific knowledge we have. In the US this is happening because a major political party is getting a lot of money from the oil and coal industry. How people can let themselves be played so easily is beyond me.

Of course  NASA gets funding from an administration that gives grants to scientists that have findings that are lockstep with their agendas.

People who have zero fundamental understanding as to how grants are awarded and research is funded are also ignorant of how by controlling variables a "scientist" can reach any desired conclusion.

Michael Moore and Al Gore and Barray Obama. If everyone agrees why insult the few that just don't get it? Who cares  right? The problem is part of government needs a crisis...to fix. That way we the people get out of their way. Enter  new bureaucracy  new taxes  new fees and ever more restrictions. It's less freedom for you and me. But more for those in control of the mess. Al Gore lies like crazy and ends up making billions. And the sheeple thank God that he would save our planet for us. Nevermind  he predicted that by now  without drastic measures...it's too late already. It's not hard to speculate why folks would get in line to keep their funding  their status  and be politically online woth their peers. Scientists aren't any more noble than politicians bankers or anyone else are they? Something to think about.

I know for a fact that your not going to volcanoes and measuring volcanic eruptions but let me give you some sense. When a volcano erupts a lot is dirt and dust clouds and it doesnt last forever. The fossil fuel factories are doing what a volcano does but 24/7 and none of that black smoke is dirt or dust. Its not hard to know that we do much more than a volcano.

They looked at all the forcings  natural or otherwise  worked out each ones contributions and discovered that only human CO2 emissions could account for the temperature rise.

Incredible. But as to your question; there is nothing wrong with making decisions and laws every day to protect our environment. The problem is when lies and biased research is used to tax some people and redistribute that money to others. The problems arise when America is asked to make punitive moves against its own people while the worst polluters  like China and India  get off with little to zero requirements necessary to fulfill their parts of pollution treaties.

China and India can be at fault  but doesn't make us any less responsible. I just ask questions i don't see myself on a side.

What evidence do you have (besides propaganda blogs) of science being done  "in lockstep" with the administration's "agenda"? Or scientists denied funding for opposing views?

It means they're focusing on one factor  no matter how minor  because it's the only factor humans have any influence over. We can't tilt the earth back the 2.4degrees that it's moved over the past 10 000 years. We can't decrease the sunspot activity which throws more radiation our way and we can't stop the natural cyclical changes which the earth has been experiencing since it's creation. In order to do "something" scientist choose to blame mankind for what amounts to a natural temperature rise. You should actually read the article i posted above. You may learn something  though it doesn't mesh with your preconceived beliefs.

At the most basic level humans should have a desire to protect their environment and somewhere we are losing that to our distractions and political divisions. The lies  no matter the just intent behind them  only divide us and hinder real progress. Maybe there is just too much money in the game for honesty. Maybe without threats of dire consequences a distracted nation will not act. I say  stick with the truth and vote for truth and remove politics from environmental decisions by those in power. (That's a goal  not an outline of my plan haha)

We all want clean air and clean water. Mining projects should be done in a way that has the minimum adverse impact to the planet. Deforestation is never a good thing. Controlled cutting and mandatory replanting is the way to go.  But  as you say  to invent or overstate the impact our manufacturing has on the planet and claiming that we're all going to cook to death if we don't close every factory on the planet is rubbish. I'm all in favor of renewable energy if for no other reason than because the oil won't last forever and it's a filthy industry. But pollution and "global warming" are two different issues. Our fearless leaders are mixing the two and using fear as justification to tax and fine for "offenses" which are based on lies and half truths.

The cycles are on a timescale of approx 100 thousand  21 thousand and 26 thousand years. Human activity has done nothing to stop those natural cycles.  However  human activity HAS superimposed a very fast increase in carbon levels  particularly over the past few decades  with a concomitant rise in the GMST. I've seen nothing in the IPCCs Assessment Reports to suggest that " these aren't even cycles anymore". Can you point to the relevant sources for this?

Love it. This is why all terperature change spikes predate CO2 level spikes anywhere from 10 -100 years apart. Also quite natural as we have risen out of one of the coldest time periods in a millenia. Warmer temp from sun spots  creates larger bodies of water  thus heat + larger ocean body = greater CO2 emissions (which account for the majority of the atmosphere composition). Human contributions account for .1 degree of terperature change per decade at most. (.8 degree change over the last 150 years). Minimal! Stop shitting your pants over this and get your money back.

But also take this into account with each passing year the sun gets hotter and hotter. Which in return the earth gets hotter and hotter. While we are a small part of this volcanos let out more green house gas then we do in a year. A fact of life is that each year has always been hotter then the last  and it will be that way till the sun swells and destroys the planet.

South American weather stations around the original three. In each case he found the same suspicious one-way ‚Äúadjustments‚Äù. First these ( upward temp trends) were made by the US government‚Äôs Global Historical Climate Network (GHCN). They were then amplified by two of the main official surface records  the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (Giss) and the National Climate Data Center (NCDC)  which use the warming trends to estimate temperatures across the vast regions of the Earth where no measurements are taken. Yet these are the very records on which scientists and politicians rely for their belief in ‚Äúglobal warming‚Äù.

Since about 1985 it hasn't been continuously. I think 1991 was the last strong winter with snow as high as 50 cm (in his home town). The last few years there was barely snow. My father is now 75 years old. I think he knows best what global warming means...

I think you're misreading my comment..  Per National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) :  "The term temperature anomaly means a departure from a reference value or long-term average. A positive anomaly indicates that the observed temperature was warmer than the reference value  while a negative anomaly indicates that the observed temperature was cooler than the reference value."

Temperature anomaly is the deviation from the historical normal temperature. So colored Maps showing the Arctic the most red are saying it has the largest temperature anomaly because it is the warmest above its historical levels. So the Arctic is not the hottest place on earth but it is the area that has warmed the most above what the temps should be.  What caused it? Several things.   1. CO2 sources are mostly in the northern hemisphere. Air currents circulate from the equator to the pole so CO2 traps heat at the pole maximizing warming there.  2. Less sea ice.  Ice reflects sunlight back into space. With the warm ocean and warm air the ice cap has been melting & shrinking for years. Sunlight is not reflected back to space adding to warming.  3. Increased ocean temp. Without sea ice the water is exposed to sunlight and absorbs the sunlight. This raises the ocean temperature increasing air temperature above it and also increasing the melting of sea ice. This exposes more water to sunlight   increasing absorbed sunlight  raising ocean temp and increasing air temp above it and increasing the melting of sea ice. This exposes more water to sunlight  ..... Well you see the feedback loop...  4. Reduced snow cover. Higher temps melt snow. Instead of sunlight being reflected back to space by the snowpack sunlight is now absorbed by the darker tundra vegetation. This melts permafrost and releases methane from the decomposing vegetation in the now thawed bogs. Methane is another potent greenhouse gas.  5. Wildfires. Two years ago Siberia and last year Alaska and Canada had many wildfires in their high latitude forests. These were caused by high heat  lack of snow pack  and no rain. The burning forests released their sequestered CO2 back into the atmosphere near the Arctic Circle  i.e. 66.5¬∞ north latitude. Due to circulation patterns the CO2 stays near the pole increasing the greenhouse effect over the Arctic.

They were then amplified by two of the main official surface records  the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (Giss) and the National Climate Data Center (NCDC)  which use the warming trends to estimate temperatures across the vast regions of the Earth where no measurements are taken. Yet these are the very records on which scientists and politicians rely for their belief in ‚Äúglobal warming‚Äù.

One would expect to see a correlation if the Sun were the cause. But it has decreased in output.

Ocean chemistry being altered by all the fresh water from the melted ice  so fish and such dying in huge mumbers. Worse storms  worse droughts. Think of it like being in a room full of people smoking cigarettes. After a while the potted plants are wilting  it's hot and humid in the room  your skin is covered in sticky gunk  you are sweaty and you're coughing your lungs half-way up  and the glass of water you walked in with has a layer of smelly goo on it.
