They seem so complex and bulky  and if they could thin them down a bit while still being durable and airtight  it might make repairs way easier to do  plus then the astronauts could wear them inside  if they were comfortable enough  and be safe if there was a sudden depressurization!  Plus if NASA could invent really cool  affordable  space proof armor  similar technology might be used for sea diving or hazardous activities or even cool normal wear in a durable suit made from some kind of neat  yet cheap (optional?) material  like those new graphite materials they keep inventing.  I also think it would be cool if NASA put some of its efforts into cost-cutting  so that spaceship fuel and parts and maintence and assembly were all way cheaper  so that private industry space flights  putting satellites into orbit  even tourists and more luxurious space stations and living on other planets  could all become possible and profitable with a massive decrease in the price and complexity of space travel!  I for one would love to see spaceships be as common as jets  with companies scrambling to build them as fast as possible and put satellites into orbit and do other capitalistic deeds in order to maximize profits  invent cool new stuff  explore the solar system  mine the other planets  start colonies  and more  all hinged on cheap space flight (and some biodomes  too).

And someone mentioned it only had 70lbs of nuclear pellet fuel....so I understand the risk of explosion  but is there some reason it didn't have say  7 tons of nuclear fuel instead of 70lbs? Is the fuel very expensive? Also how big of a hazard would an explosion be?  I was thinking one reason to colonize other planets would be to reduce the risk of nuclear explosion/radiation  and that the moon might be a great place to build a nuclear launch facility  since the moon is already irradiated by the sun and a lack of an atmosphere  plus the escape velocity of the moon is much lower than the earth.  I also think it should be possible to obtain nuclear materials on the moon itself  without having to ship them there from earth  because of my theory that because uranium and plutonium are minerals  they are formed under the surface of the moon (and all other planets) by the crushing force of gravity and all the materials on top of them - thus  if you drill or dig deep enough  you should be able to find uranium and plutonium to fuel rockets deep in the moon  without any environmental concerns since the biodomes will already have to be shielded against radiation.

Wouldn't be the image of what has been a billion years ago?

Thanks to SpaceX and Elon Musk for the vision and dedication to do this. And very exciting to see a new generation taking up the torch. Big gov't and big corps have brought much space innovation to a crawl if not a halt. Highly recommend reading the Elon Musk bio  a great read and amazing to see what visionary leadership can still do (thanks to Spencer MacBeth for making me so aware of this).

I understand that it is more cost efficient but it is far more risky as well. The barge will be unstable on the water and there are a lot more variables. It seems risk is unjustified even if cost of landing on land is greater than on water

Now it is time for our species to break the surly bonds of Earth and colonise the hell out of Mars.

THIS. Right damn here.  A whole crapload of very smart  hard-working  and enthusiastic people dripping blood  sweat  and tears  demonstrating that YES  astounding accomplishments are possible. YES  single-minded pursuit of excellence can have completely positive results. YES  capitalist motivations can benefit huge numbers of people.  Mr. Putin  you can take those RD-180s and sit on them  there in your paranoid  delusional  innocent-blood-soaked wasteland.  All you religious fanatics  of every stripe  who want to take global cultures back to the Dark Ages because you're too frightened or stupid or wrapped up in bronze-age myths to accept the reality that is upon the human race  can all toddle off to some backwoods corner and slaughter each other to your heart's delight  as long as you stay there and stop contaminating the rest of humanity with your venality and viciousness and villainy.

What you don't get from the video is that it lit up for about 4 seconds about ten miles high and you could see the glow falling like a rock until it lit up again at landing. Just after it landed we got hit by a very powerful sonic boom. Cannot wait for the launch later this year when the send up three Falcon 9s strapped together and wonder if all three will land together.

On December 21st 2015 around 8:35 p.m. my family and me were traveling to Orlando  suddenly the sky was iluminated for a red light which seems like a rocket. Few hour later checking updates in facebook We realize that the rocket was real. This rocket was the falcon 9. Its mission was splited in two different goals to achieve: A) Launch the rocket  deploying the first stage and landing it vertically. B) The second one was to deploy 11 different small satellites on space.

I'd be surprised if rocket science has been applied to oncology before.   Just because something hasn't been done doesn't mean it couldn't or shouldn't be.  Doesn't that have to be one of Musk's mottos anyway? ;)

I understand the need to land on a barge for future "high velocity missions" and I   at least personally  appreciate the effort the team is putting into it. However given the weight of the barge  the small contact surface and the fact that nature takes its toll on all elements including the sea  wouldn't it be a better idea if you tried an alternative?

You can re-use it and guide it wherever you need..Thank you and keep up the good work!

This one event has the potential to change Human civilization forever. Instead of just throwing the booster into the ocean  we bring it back. We refurbish it  and we reuse it. Humans do it  and in spectacular fashion too. You've got to admit  this is cool as all get out.  When you look at those people cheering at the historic first landing recovery of a booster  try to keep in mind. Those people work in California and Florida and other places hands on to build all that stuff. They get paid good money to do it. That's where Bernie Sanders education program comes in.   Our nation needs educated hands to build the 21st Century lifestyle we want. We Humans want to expand our presence to the cosmos. This type of endeavour enables that. So let's pour money into expanding into the cosmos. To building colonies on Mars and the moon. To mining resources both material and of energy. To exploit and harvest the bounty of the universe  and thus preserve the Earth.  Please remember  the $16 trillion the American people used to bail out Wall Street and "to big to fail" banks was enough to have funded 91 Apollo programs from start to finish. From Mercury to the last two canceled Apollo missions  $16 trillion could of done all of that times 91. If our nation had of made a commitment in 2008 to build solar arrays in orbit around the Earth  beaming solar energy to collectors on the ground  I'm pretty sure $16 trillion could of done the job. Even asteroid mining for platinum and rare earth metals could of been had. All we needed to do is put our minds to it  and the money. Just call me stupid  but I have a feeling that 91 Apollo size programs might have been enough to get asteroid mining going.  Let us not forget all the jobs created too! Look at them people cheering. Now think of the Apollo program. At its peak the Apollo program employed 400 000 people and the services of 20 000 businesses and universities. What I'm saying is  if we had of put the $16 trillion into 91 Apollo size projects  perhaps we could of put 91 X 400 000 = 36 400 000 people to work. We could of been asking China to take some of our excess jobs instead of struggling to get back the jobs we lost.  Honestly  we all got screwed big time with all that bailout mess. Instead of building the future of our civilization  we gave it all away to greedy crooks.  You know that national effort to build an atomic bomb? We need the same urgency and sense of purpose in rekindling the American spirit of exploration and expansion. Obama wants to rekindle the spirit of innovation. Well  here is the way to do it.  Put $16 trillion into the creation of a national effort and commitment for a program 91 times the size of Apollo to expand Humanity's presence into our planetary neighborhood. That would include colonies on the moon and Mars  orbital habitat around Earth the moon and Mars  orbital solar power collection grids  asteroid mining operations and processing facilities  Earth based infrastructure and support systems  training and education programs  and retrofitting existing factories and facilities for use with this national effort.  Think big!

Not gonna lie I teared up a lil bit  as did many of my co workers around me. Its an honor to be apart of history and the SpaceX team. F9 paint will keep pumping them out ! Lets see if elon wants us to re paint the first stage lol o man its gonna be fun !

Getting the top comment has been a dream of mine for many years  and I would like to thank those who have helped me along the way. Next I would like to thank my parents. I want to thank my frnd kam's cat  for being really fat and always there for me. I would also like to thank my pet tadpol for surviving against all odds for over a week.Next I would like to thank the squirrel that lives in my backyard for climbing trees because that gives me inspiration that I need to get through the day. This is a special moment in my life and I would like to thank any of my unmentioned friends and family that have helped me along the way. This moment will be a moment that I will never forget. I just remmembered a few other people I would like to thank; facebook  the fish I caught in the third grade  my lightin my room bc I wouldn’t be able to see the keyboard without it  the internet for letting me go on facebook  my house because without it I would be homeless  and last but not least I would like to thank all the people out there that actually took time out of theirday to read this. I cannot stress how much of a big deal to me thisis. I have been trying to be the first comment on a post for years  but that has not been possible until this amazing day. Hopefully my good luck will continue  but this is undoubtedly a rare occasion. If you asked how I did this  I would say  you can achieveanything u set your mind on. To all the kids out there reading this  I would like to tell them to follow their dreams. Being the top comment is amazing  thank you everyone.

Wouldn't parachute do the task more efficiently  saving weight of fuel to launch payload? And having only solid fuel rocket cartridge to be fired few seconds prior to landing?

I have an idea - as you begin to warehouse spent first stages - it might be nice to run "Go-Fund-Me" campaigns to relaunch the used first stages with your own missions or launches.  For example  sending an Ion Thrusting Lunar Orbiter to change orbit altitudes & inclinations at will - as a constant reminder of what your technology can do.  In this example  I'd be willing to shell out $50-100 for the mission - and  I'm sure there are lots of others who'd like to see it as well (presuming you ran a 24/7 video POP for paying subscribers ... with adverts for key optical targets (like Moon Landing locations)...  I suspect it won't take too many examples of recycling before all your used stages are 'sold' prior to flight ... but  until then  this would be a cool idea!  Keep up the great work!!!

What's the most interesting thing you learned? Have you found the greatest stress points? When will you know the full cost of a total turnaround refurbishment?

Considering the incredible heat & forces at work during ascent & return  the craft looks in remarkably good shape.

Or is this a step-by-step thing where the first goal was getting one returned safely  and the next step will be assessing design needs to make re-use safe and cost effective?

And recently I was watching footage of the Space Shuttle Launch  it believe it was Challenger. And one can clearly see from the camera angle  a moment where the entire shuttle  shifted forwards  right upon ignition. and for a very brief moment  was not shooting strait up.

I don't want any pay. I just want to be some kind of a part of it  even if in name only. I witnessed Apollo flying overhead as a child growing up in Florida  and watched humans first steps on the moon in front of that old B&W TV. I was born 30 years to soon. I wanted to be a part of the team.  You young folks are so lucky. You're making history! I wanted to be a part of it  but got sick with cancer  and decided to not apply. I got cured of the cancer so far  but my body is kind of broken. That's okay though. It couldn't be helped. I'll still cheer you all on  you lucky persons you!  Just do me one favor. My dream is to see humans walk on Mars before I die. If you guys can help make that dream come true  I will have received everything in life I could of hoped for.

Would be nice to keep it intact but nicer to use it to build even more successful rockets.  You guys are the experts I know you will do it right.

How much rework does it need to be launched again?  Now that you have your perfect result the examination will be interesting to see the durability of the vehicle.

As you can see  the booster is almost exactly centered over the stylized X (the SpaceX logo  but also a convenient way to mark a spot  say)."

Bohr was right when he told to Einstein not to work on Gravitation because he will not be able to explain it. Bohr and others did not have to courage to study Gravitation.	 Einstein deserved a Nobel Prize for Gravitation because all the scientists considered that he explained Gravitation in General Relativity theory. Einstein tried to explain Gravitation in General Relativity but he did not succeed. You learned from your professors at universities that General Relativity explains Gravitation. All important journals today accept manuscripts related to Gravitation only if they are based on General Relativity. In my view nobody explained Gravitation; nobody was able to explain why an apple fell on Newton’s head. General relativity  LQG  String theory  Quantum gravity theories are wrong theories because are limited to the speed of light and do not explain Gravitation.  “I am the first who Understood and Explained Gravitation with high speed gravitons v = 1.001762 × 10^17 m/s  with Negative Impulse  Negative Mass and Negative Energy”                                                       Adrian Ferent http://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/  https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287331589_Ferent_Gravitation_theory

Only 2 to 3 flight days away  Moon is the logical first location for extraterrestrial industrial development - a proving ground for subsequent exploration and development in more distant regions of the solar system and points beyond. First  let's free ourselves from the concept of Earth as a world isolated in space.  Far from being a closed environmental system isolated in space  Earth is a luxury passenger ship traveling in the company of a vast fleet of supply ships in the convoy of the Sun. The material and energy resources contained in the planets  comets  and asteroids of our solar system are within our reach. If we choose to pursue them  these vast resources will allow us to improve the lives of all people  and will allow Mankind an infinite future unlimited by the dwindling resources of our home planet. We will shift our large-scale  polluting industries off-world in order to better maintain Earth at its best - as Mankind's home and garden  capable of supporting an expanding human population at an increasing standard of living  for the duration of our star. Man  with his unlimited imagination and his unlimited creativity  will  in time  outgrow his home planet and his home solar system  and may one day roam the Universe  manipulating matter and energy and re-engineering spacetime to suit his own purposes. That  I like to think  is the overall mission of our civilization.

Y además que conocen las que se están desarrollando e investigando. Por tanto no tiene sentido enumerar ninguna  Pero me gustaría compartir una idea. Puesto que es posible en la actualidad generar un gran caudal de neutrones a partir de energía y mediante dispositivos de fusión nuclear sencillos  baratos pero que carecen de utilidad alguna para producir energía pero sí producen neutrones consumiento energía... Como electrodos de tantalato de litio en agua pesada y muchos más  Hace años que pienso que se podría usar un mecanismo de este tipo en el centro de una envoltura hecha de material procedente de centrales nucleares de fision. Es decir  residuos de baja actividad con nula capacidad para fisionar por sí mismos  que no se sabe que hacer con ellos pero que tienen potencial  Y el usar los neutrones del primer dispositivo para fisionar el residuo. De forma que se baje su actividad  que con el dispositivo se controle el proceso y se pueda conseguir energía por termopares  material piroeléctrico  pasar un fluido por su interior o incluso acelerar un fluido como en los BNTR.   Y así tener un sistema complementario con el solar para colonias y naves espaciales mientras se trabaja en conseguir fusión nuclear eficiente de verdad algún día o lo que sea  Desconozco si en uno de los sistemas de producción neutrones capas de grafito  berilio e hidroxiapatita u otros materiales podrían controlar el flujo de neutrones y regular la reacción  Hay muchas propuestas de motores espaciales. El llamado VASIRM parece que tiene problemas serios en cuanto a calor y otros. También pensaba que como se puede usar el LASER para acelerar plasma se podría acoplar uno en el VASIRM alimentado de la energía aprovechada del calor que emite  de forma que cuando se caliente pueda igualmente empujar y recuperar parte de la energía haciéndolo más eficiente. No se si tiene sentido esto último.

At the end I hope to have a nice ship. You to have Sir. This apply for   the atmosphere. No not even if you put them under the engine. THANK YOU.

Frankly  in an age when the cumulative knowledge of mankind is quite literally at our fingertips  this generation prioritizes selfies  snapchats  and useless apps.  At a time when mankind should be using these new tools of communication to better understand our differences  we squabble and spar over them.  We have lost the courage and pioneer spirit of our fore-bearers. On September 12  1962  President John F. Kennedy addressed an audience at Rice University and posed the questions "Why climb the highest mountains? Why fly the Atlanitc?" I believe SpaceX is the natural inheritor of the Apollo program and the only organization (corporate or government) with the audacity to extend the reach of mankind and challenge our place in the universe.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFAlo4lHN-A

Some missions  such as those placing communications satellites in geosynchronous orbit  use so much fuel that there would be none left over for any landing. Others might be able to land  but it would be more economical to seek a target down range rather than returning to the launch site. By using the unmanned barge  SpaceX will not only succeed where it previously only managed near misses  but will also be able to increase the capabilities of the booster."

Since this pivotal breakthrough has been achieved  mass production of these rapidly reusable rockets will begin soon after additional tests to ensure safety and reliability are successfully completed. How long will it take for this technology to evolve to fully and rapidly reusable space planes that can take off and land from existing airports?

This Sunday  we wish you luck to complement your meticulous calculations for your sea landing! For this generation  it is without doubt that your mission of creating reusable rockets is one of the technological advances for the scientific community and for the people - including me -  who also aspire to do great things. You see  I am having my 20th birthday tomorrow (14 January). And if it doesn't cause to much trouble  would it be okay to place my name on your rocket for your sea-landing? Seeing my name on that rocket fly off and land back to Earth will really be a big inspiration boost for me. Being a physics student and witnessing these breakthroughs in engineering and science  it is really thrilling and inspiring to live in this age. It would mean a lot to me if this can be done. :)
