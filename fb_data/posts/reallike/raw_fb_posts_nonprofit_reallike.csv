He was almost 31 years old & had spent over 20 years of his life suffering in a bleak  concrete enclosure (often in the sweltering heat) at the Mendoza Zoo in Argentina.  People called Arturo "the world's saddest polar bear" because of the years he spent suffering alone in the Argentinian heat. But from elephants swaying alone on concrete floors to bears pacing & biting the bars of barren cages  sadness remains on display in unnatural enclosures at zoos around the world.  PETA urges families to honor this polar bear's heartbreaking legacy by refusing to give a dime to any business that puts animals on display for human entertainment.  R.I.P. Arturo. You didn't deserve this.

You shouldn't have died this way  & you shouldn't have been there in the first place.    Yet again  captivity has taken an animal's life. The gorilla enclosure should have been surrounded by a secondary barrier between the humans & the animals to prevent exactly this type of incident. Gorillas have shown that they can be protective of smaller living beings & react the same way any human would to a child in danger.  Even under the "best" circumstances  captivity is never acceptable for gorillas or other primates  & in cases like this  it's even deadly. This tragedy is exactly why #PETA urges families to stay away from any facility that displays animals as sideshows for humans to gawk at. http://peta.vg/1qyq

He donated his pro-vegan song "Animal Kingdom" to us:   "No member of the animal kingdom nurses past maturity No member of the animal kingdom ever did a thing 2 me It's why I don't eat red meat or white fish Don't give me no blue cheese We're all members of the animal kingdom Leave your brothers and sisters in the sea"   He partied with us in 2005 at our Millennium Gala  & was named our Sexiest Vegetarian in 2006.   He spoke out and sang against abusing and killing animals for food and clothing  including by serving a gourmet vegan meal to reporters and blasting the wool industry in his liner notes for Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic  in which he appeared in a faux-wool jacket: "If this jacket were real wool  it would have taken 7 lambs whose lives would have begun like this … Within weeks of their birth  their ears would have been hole-punched  their tails chopped off and the males would have been castrated while fully conscious."   Prince's legacy of compassion & creativity will live on  & he will be sorely missed. http://peta.vg/1qcw

This means that the orcas currently held captive at its marine parks will be the "last generation" who will be imprisoned in this way.  #PETA has campaigned hard & today there is a payoff for future generations of orcas. For decades orcas  dolphins  beluga whales  seals  & many other animals have suffered in SeaWorld confinement. To do right by them now  SeaWorld must open its tanks to ocean sanctuaries so that these long-suffering animals can finally have some semblance of a life outside prison tanks.   Our SeaWorld Campaign wins Round 1. They have taken a step forward  but more must follow. PETA urges kind people everywhere to keep campaigning strong!

As a child  she pored over comic books -- even though  she noted  their heroes rarely reflected who she was. The racism and sexism in what she read threatened to turn her away from comics.  Truesdale took matters into her own hands and founded Aza Comics  a brand devoted to producing comics featuring female superheroes -- many of them women of color. When designing the heroines of Aza Comics  she didn't just create what she wanted to see -- she asked other women  too.

Initially  costs spent on homeless services  such as medical care and public benefits  significantly increased  but that was mostly due to their deteriorating health and the fact that they hadn't sought out care in recent years. Once they settled into their housing and programming  those expenses declined by $31.5 million  or 56%  from 2011 to 2015.  2.5 million U.S. youth experience homelessness every year.

Awhile back as I was walking out of Target I saw you taking a picture of my van parked in a disabled parking spot. You took off when you saw me coming  I wish you hadn’t  I wish you would have stayed so I could explain.  Yes  my van has running stickers on it  and yes  it’s an ironic picture  seeing my 13.1 and 25k stickers on a vehicle in a disabled spot  I get why you took the picture.  The playful side of me actually hopes you and your friends got a few laughs out of the picture.  But I hope you noticed my child when we exited the store. He was sitting in the cart even though he’s far too big. That’s because my child is the person the placard is for.  My guess is that the possibility hadn’t even occurred to you.  And that’s why I’m writing this.  My son is permanently disabled. He can walk  but not for any distance  and he has many health problems that sometimes prevent walking much at all.  And we aren’t alone or unusual. Maybe my perspective is slanted too because I have dozens of friends whose children have disabilities  and because of how I often struggle to find an open handicapped spot at the children’s hospitals we frequent. I  simply want you to understand that children can be disabled and get a parking placard too.  And just for the record  I don’t use it unless my son is with me.  I wish we could have chatted for a minute  because I think we would have had a good conversation  and I probably would have broadened my perspective by listening to you as well.  Although to be honest my son was in meltdown mode and we probably wouldn’t have been able to make much of the opportunity anyway. So if you happen to see this on the interweb  drop me a note. I’d like to hear from you." -Alethea  writer of: https://benswritingrunningmom.wordpress.com/

"I shatter a little bit when I think people don't like me...it really hurts my feelings when I know I'm not liked. And I know that's not very healthy  and I fight it all the time."  She talked about how her mom told her  “the world wants to shame you” for taking medication to help herself  but that it was important for her to remember that in the medical community  no one would “deny a diabetic his insulin.”  Due to stigma  college underclassmen are often reluctant to seek help at their school’s counseling center. Let's take action and decrease the stigma.

A few months later  she received her first harassing messages.  "I think before they realised I was 12  they just realised I was a woman " says Temple-Wood  now a 21-year-old science student. Temple-Wood has stuck around on Wikipedia and became an administrator and developing two collaborative projects aimed at closing the online encyclopedia's "content gap" - including one that adds and improves articles about women scientists.  91% of Wikipedia's editors are male. The more women who contribute to Wikipedia pages  the smaller the gender gap will become. Let's go  girls!  If you identify as female  host a "Girls-Only Edit-a-Thon." themed party. Fight the gender gap by editing and creating female-focused Wikipedia pages together.

Pediatric oncologist and researcher Tanja Gruber  M.D.  Ph.D.  treats kids who have high-risk leukemia. She researches specific types of leukemia  including infantile acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. Dr. Gruber coordinates a clinical trial designed to treat infant patients with ALL who have a mutation in the MLL gene. Kids with this type of leukemia tend to have a high risk of relapse  and most do not respond well to current therapies. The study tests a new approach of adding two known adult anti-cancer drugs to standard ALL chemotherapy. Learn more about Dr. Gruber: www.stjude.org/gruber

He was 91.  Harry Ferrier enlisted in the Navy on January 28  1941  three days after his sixteenth birthday. After boot camp and aviation radio school  he joined Torpedo Squadron 8 (VT-8) stationed on the aircraft carrier USS Hornet.  In 1941  VT-8 was flying the outdated TBD Devastator  but in early 1942  the squadron was selected to receive the first of the new TBF Avengers. Since the USS Hornet was immediately needed in the Pacific  a small detachment of VT-8 was chosen to stay behind and train on the new planes. Harry Ferrier  his pilot Albert “Bert” Earnest and gunner Jay Manning were selected to be part of this detachment.  After about three months of training on the Avenger  Ferrier and the detachment of six Avengers were sent to Pearl Harbor to join the rest of VT-8. Arriving on May 28  1942  the detachment had missed the USS Hornet which had sailed for Midway a day earlier. The group then volunteered to fly directly to Midway Island to re-enforce the Marine Garrison there.  On June 4  1942  Harry Ferrier and his crew received word of Japanese aircraft heading towards Midway and sightings of an enemy fleet 150 miles out to sea. All six Avengers took off immediately. Five minutes later  Jay manning reported seeing Japanese planes starting their attack on Midway Island.   About an hour later  Bert Earnest saw Japanese ships on the horizon. As the Avengers prepared to attack  they were jumped by Japanese Zeros. Harry Ferrier heard Jay Manning fire a few rounds from his turret  but then go silent. He looked up after feelings Manning’s blood drip on him and saw Manning’s lifeless body and the turret full of holes.  Flying at 200 feet  the Avengers pressed home their attacks on the Japanese fleet  but under a swarm of Zeros they were being shot down one by one. Canon shells from the Zeros shot away the elevator  compass and hydraulics on Ferrier’s plane. Pilot Bert Earnest struggled with the controls  but managed to release his torpedo at a Japanese cruiser. Soon after  Harry Ferrier was hit by shrapnel and knocked unconscious.  After fending off Zeros and flying on dead reckoning  Bert Earnest managed to locate Midway Island. Harry Ferrier regained consciousness and Earnest asked him to confirm that the torpedo was successfully launched. Ferrier couldn’t tell because the window to the bomb bay was covered in blood.  Ferrier’s Avenger approached Midway and prepared for landing. With only one wheel down  it was waived off twice. On the third approach Earnest touched down. The plane ground looped and came to a gentle stop.  Harry Ferrier and Bert Earnest were alive. They were the only plane of VT-8 to return to base. Five out of six of VT-8’s Midway based Avengers were lost and all 15 of their carrier based Devastators were shot down during the battle. Their Avenger had nearly 70 holes in it.  For his actions that day  Harry Ferrier was awarded the Purple Heart and the Distinguished Flying Cross. His pilot  Bert Earnest was awarded the Navy Cross and the Purple Heart.  Harry Ferrier continued to fly with VT-8 after the Battle of Midway  participating in the Battle of Guadalcanal. After WWII  he stayed in the Navy and served in Korea and Vietnam.  RIP  brother.

The study is examining the treatments Gulf War veterans (or other veterans with similar problems) with Gulf War illness symptoms. This study will seek to understand which treatments are helpful  harmful  or have no impact in controlling the symptoms of Gulf War Illness. They also wish to hear from others with similar problems to learn how treatment effects differ and identify other promising treatments.  A total of 400 study participants who live within the United States are needed to participate in this study who meet the following criteria:  1. Gulf War veterans: Veterans who were deployed to the Persian Gulf Region July 1990 - August 1991 and have experienced health changes.  2. Veterans: Active members of the United States Military that have experienced unexplained chronic multisymptom health changes. Study participants will complete up to 6 online surveys. Each addresses a different aspect of your treatment experience or symptoms  or asks about factors  like exposures  that may lead to differences in the effect of a treatment. Each survey will take approximately 0.5 – 2 hours. The surveys will consist of questions that ask about your overall heath  well-being  symptoms  exposures  treatments you have tried  as well as your healthcare experience.  You can proceed to the next survey either immediately after  or a week after  a prior survey has been completed (or specify another time to be reminded).

Fatma was born in Debes hospital  a medical structure a 45 minute drive away from Dibaga camp. Her parents and six siblings have been living in Dibaga camp since the camp was established a year ago. “It was a difficult delivery. It took two days and a midwife helped me give birth. I came to the clinic today because the baby’s belly button has a problem. I am not well myself  I feel sick and I keep bleeding.”   3.3 million Iraqis are now displaced in the country. While the humanitarian response in camps within the Kurdistan Region of Iraq has been strong and people have overall good access to services  they represent only 10% of the displaced population.  The majority live outside camps  with relatives  in rented houses  in unfinished buildings  surviving on their savings and struggling to find work and with little access to aid.  MSF has been running mobile clinics in the area for over a year. When the camp opened in September 2015  the medical team started working in the healthcare centre of Dibaga providing primary healthcare with special focus on mother and child  chronic disease and mental health services. In the last four months over 4 500 consultations were carried out.   © Manu Brabo / MEMO for MSF

This sweet fellow was living outdoors in the Florida heat and so badly injured that the rescue group who found him just couldn’t leave him out there. They took him in  but strangely  couldn’t get his wound to heal. To make matters worse  it turned out he was feline leukemia (FeLV) discordant. That means he tests positive for feline leukemia on one kind of test and negative on another. So to be safe  discordant cats shouldn’t be around either positive cats (who might make them fully positive) or negative cats (who might catch it from them). What a mess!  So Papaya came to Best Friends to recover! Following a much-needed surgery and 24/7 care from our wonderful staff  we’re happy to share that he’s now finally on the road to healing. Can you give just $5 to help Papaya and other animals like him get the care they need? It’s easy to make a gift today by clicking the DONATE button below! -abigail

And it’s a good thing  because it was his tremendous meowing that summoned help when he was stranded all alone in pink sand dunes  with no one to take care of him. After his rescue  it was discovered that Sundance needed medical help. His eyelids didn’t form quite properly  so his eyelashes are scratching his eyes. Ouch!    So Sundance came to Best Friends where he’s not only getting the care that every three month-old kitten needs  but he’s also getting help for those irritating eyes. He’s a playful little guy  and very fond of humans. We hope this little orange ball of friendliness will grow up into a big  brave  healthy cat who can open his eyes in comfort! Can you give just $5 to help Sundance and other animals like him get the care they need? It’s easy to make a gift today by clicking the DONATE button below! -abigail

So we have been looking at how to find treatments that are not chemotherapy  but can kill a broad spectrum of tumor cells so we don't have to worry about finding a single target. We are looking to find a compound or a treatment that kills the tumor based on something it depends on to survive."  #WatesVsCancer  Stay tuned … we'll be bringing you more about Rebecca's crowdfunded research later this summer.

Then  the Ecuador earthquake hit—causing a concrete wall to collapse on top of her and break her left leg. Dr. Leland McCluskey  an orthopedic surgeon working with Samaritan’s Purse  inserted pins into her femur to repair the break. While Marielena was in surgery  her mother  Eugenia  became sick and was taken to the emergency room. Doctors discovered that she was malnourished  suffered from a chronic lung disease  and had double pneumonia. When Eugenia heard this diagnosis  she had a panic attack. “She was in a moment of despair ” said one of our chaplains. The chaplain said he was patiently sitting by her bedside  speaking soothing words and spoon-feeding her soup when he sensed God’s leading to speak to her about Christ. In the middle of a busy emergency room  the chaplain shared the Gospel with Eugenia. She recognized her need for a Savior and accepted Jesus. “It’s almost like I felt Jesus say  ‘Come and receive me ’” said Eugenia. Meanwhile  precious Marielena woke up from surgery and found out that her mom was sick. She cried in her hospital bed as she clutched her stuffed doll with pink hair and a dress to match. Crouching beside her bed  a staff member asked her fun questions and played with her doll. Marielena’s tears slowly turned to smiles and laughter—a universal language. In the midst of the devastation  we praise God that we were able to be a beacon of light to the Rodriguez family and others. Most importantly  we’re thankful for the opportunity to point people to the Light of the World as we worked to provide them with physical relief.  “I called to Jesus  and He touched my heart and helped me in my moment of distress ” said Eugenia.   Please pray for Eugenia’s family as she shares her new faith—that they  too  will accept Jesus as Savior. For the people of Ecuador as they continue to recover from the catastrophic earthquake. For our staff and volunteers as they serve the suffering in Jesus’ Name.

It killed hundreds  injured thousands  and turned countless homes  hospitals  and other buildings into piles of stone and rubble. Less than 24 hours after the disaster  Samaritan’s Purse dispatched an emergency response team to one of the hardest-hit areas of the country. With many healthcare facilities damaged or destroyed  we immediately identified an urgent medical need and loaded our recently refurbished DC-8 with our emergency field hospital. It included an emergency room  one operating room  a full pharmacy  and 30 inpatient beds. “I’ve been in many different places with Samaritan’s Purse  but we’ve never had this full capacity ” said Dr. Brianna Wilson. “It’s a really wonderful opportunity to help the Ecuadorian people when their own hospitals couldn’t keep up.” Not only did our teams care for those who were injured  they provided clean water  along with sanitation and hygiene kits  and shelter materials. When Samaritan’s Purse President Franklin Graham arrived in Ecuador less than a week after the earthquake  he witnessed the devastation firsthand. “Children lost parents  and families lost homes and everything they own ” he said. “Please pray for the people of Ecuador. They have a long road ahead of them. They need our prayers.” In the first three days of operation alone  doctors at the emergency field hospital performed 43 surgeries and treated hundreds of patients.   Please pray for the people of Ecuador as they continue to recover from the catastrophic earthquake. For our staff and volunteers as they serve the suffering in Jesus’ Name.

It was one of those confrontations that landed Marten in Kudjip Nazarene Hospital with a life-changing decision to make. Marten and his wife fought constantly. Tired of the abuse  she slashed his leg with a bush knife. He would have bled to death  but relatives were able to bring him to Kudjip  where he underwent major surgery. Marten was resting in his hospital bed one morning when he heard the sound of people singing. He got up and limped into the hallway. There he found a group of hospital staff and patients holding devotions and singing worship songs. Later Sheena Li  a dentist  accompanied a nurse to Marten’s bedside and shared the Gospel with him. “We spoke of the hope and reason of our joy  and also how Christ is able to make all things new ” explained Li  who serves at Kudjip through World Medical Mission’s Post- Residency Program. “Marten did not want to live his life the way he had been. He repented and wanted to follow Jesus. We explained that this doesn’t mean all his problems will go away ” Li said. “In fact  he will face even more struggles in the days ahead as a new believer. But now he will know Christ’s love and forgiveness and be able to extend mercy to others.” Marten has since been discharged from the hospital  and the chaplain has arranged for the pastor of the church in his village to contact him. For Marten and his wife  the difficult journey toward forgiveness and healing has just begun.   Please pray for Marten to grow in his faith and for healing in his marriage. For Kudjip hospital staff as they share the Gospel of Jesus Christ with patients and their families. For domestic and tribal conflicts in the bush villages to be resolved peacefully.

They live in Swaziland and struggled to make ends meet. To make matters worse  their health was constantly at risk due to their local water supply. The community spring provided locals with a limited supply of water  which the Motsa family often had to fight for. Even when they did get enough water  they often suffered from dysentery and other water-borne diseases  as they had to share their water source with livestock.  One day a local pastor was passing by while Portia was collecting water at the spring. He asked her for a drink. He thanked her  then encouraged her to read John 4:4-42 in the Bible.  On her way home Portia borrowed a Bible from a friend and read the story of the Samaritan woman with Jesus at the well: “Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again  but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty again. The water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life” (ESV).  “I was so touched by this story  I kept reading it again and again ” Portia said. “Then I sensed that one day God would provide us with clean  sweet drinking water.” But first  she wanted to meet this God who supernaturally provides living water. At church the next Sunday  she chose to follow Jesus. Not only did God save Portia’s soul  He soon provided clean water—fulfilling Portia’s dream. He used Samaritan’s Purse and local ministry partners to cap the community’s spring to prevent contamination. We also installed storage tanks that provide the community with better access to a safe supply of drinkable water. “The Lord has done marvelous things for me and my family. My children are healthy now and no one from our community has become sick.”   Please pray that Portia and her community will thrive  now that they have access to clean water. That Portia will grow in her relationship with Jesus and be a witness to her family and friends. That Samaritan’s Purse will be able to provide clean water to more communities.

In some cultures  it's uncommon to offer help to those of a different religion. So when Samaritan's Purse partners with brave brothers and sisters in difficult places to bring relief and show compassion without discrimination  solely for the sake of the Gospel  it speaks loudly. Recently  we partnered with churches in South Asia to provide emergency food and clean water to thousands of flood victims—many of them poor  mistreated farmers. Our teams reached out to Muslim  Hindu  and Christian families and saw God using their efforts to touch hearts. One of the recipients was a young mother named Nida. Her husband had abandoned her and their four children  and they now live with her elderly parents. Nida doesn't have skills to support her children and sick father  so she took a job as a farm laborer. During the flooding  Nida was working in the fields and didn’t know the water was rising in her home and threatening the lives of her family. Fortunately  they were rescued; but by the time Nida arrived  their home was lost. The fields where she works were also ruined. When our church partner gave food to her family and showed them a tangible expression of God’s love  it lifted Nida's spirits  and she expressed her gratitude. During this flood response  the pastoral teams prayed before every distribution. A Hindu community became receptive to building relationships with them. One Christian community told the pastors that the relief items encouraged their faith in God's provision. And  the pastors could tell many more stories of lives and communities changed.  Please pray That Nida and other flood victims in South Asia will come to faith in the Lord Jesus. That our church partners will be safe as they proclaim the Gospel in dangerous places.

Some arrive with their entire families  having left behind good lives made tragic by constant conflict. So now  perhaps for the first time  they sleep in tents amid a city of tents where food is prepared over barrel fires.  Though they are provided food  they want to prepare it themselves and will often re-cook the food we give them  because they want to do something to make where they are living feel like home.

She decided to move with her eight children to another town  where she thought they would be safe. A local family hosted them  and they no longer feared that they would be killed. But a new enemy chased them—hunger. In their new town  Chantal was unable to find work and resorted to begging on the streets with her children. Eventually  neighbors of their host family gave Chantal and her children the opportunity to work in their fields. That allowed them to find food  but it wasn’t enough. They still lacked many necessities. When Samaritan’s Purse began working in the town where Chantal was living  we provided her with seeds  tools  and training. Since then  she’s planted her own garden and has already reaped 49 bundles of amaranth grain. “I consumed part of the crop and sold another part of the harvest ” Chantal said. “I used that money to buy soap  salt  oil  etc. I say thank you to Samaritan’s Purse—and to God  too—because  with this help  I now manage to support myself and to support my children.” In nearby towns  we are providing emergency food  blankets  tarps  hygiene kits  and other essentials to people displaced by conflict. “We have learned the value of sharing the love of God to all ” said Masika Salumu  another beneficiary. “This message touched us because  during times of hunger  it is sometimes difficult to think of others.” God is using Samaritan’s Purse to equip people with resources and a sense of ownership to give hope to those who have been thrust into unrest and uncertainty. War victims can now hold themselves with dignity because they’re beginning to truly understand the love of Christ.  Please pray for Chantal’s continued success with her fields. That Samaritan’s Purse can continue to support those who have been displaced by war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. For war victims to find peace and hope in Jesus Christ.

He had already been kicked out of numerous other schools for bullying in his town of Tsumeb  located four hours north of Namibia's capital of Windhoek. His first days in teacher Toneth Mercado’s kindergarten class were no different. He talked a lot during class  swore often  and fought with the other children. But Toneth saw through his behavior to his heart. “He lacked love from his mother ” she said  pointing out that Gideon is being raised by his grandparents. Gideon didn’t live up to his reputation for long. “When I started teaching them God’s Word through The Greatest Journey  he began to change ” Toneth said. This discipleship course  developed by Samaritan’s Purse for children who receive Operation Christmas Child shoeboxes  showed her students how to follow Jesus and share Him with others. In Lesson 4  they learned that Jesus is the Greatest Friend because He took the punishment we deserve through His death on the cross. During that lesson  Gideon accepted Jesus as his Savior. Toneth believes her students particularly connect with this lesson. “In Africa  parents are often separated ” she said. “Children are longing for love  longing for a friend.” Now with Jesus as his Greatest Friend  Gideon gets along with the other children in his class. When the others fight  he walks away. He is always helpful and quickly obedient  seeking to assist his teacher. At home  Gideon’s grandparents noticed the transformation as well. It especially meant a lot to his grandfather  who used to be an elder of Moria Church. Gideon loves telling his uncles  cousins  and friends about his new faith in Jesus. “Let your light so shine before men  that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven” (Matthew 5:16).  Please pray for Gideon to grow as a disciple of Christ and as an evangelist. For each of the 1.8 million children currently enrolled in The Greatest Journey to “love the Lord your God and serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul” (Deuteronomy 11:13). For local believers to respond to God’s call to teach The Greatest Journey.

It certainly became the springboard for a spiritual transformation in her heart. Alondra was getting ready for a wedding the Saturday evening after Christmas when she thought the gift bag for her present appeared too small. She decided to go exchange it. On her way home  fierce lightning crisscrossed the dark sky. Heavy rain pelted her car. Then tornado sirens blared. Alondra knew she couldn’t make it back to her mobile home in the Dallas suburb of Rowlett  so she stopped in an adjacent neighborhood. She pounded on the front door of a house but no answer. She screamed as she saw the tornado bearing down in her direction. With wood whizzing past her head  she grabbed a column of porch bricks and held on for dear life. Seconds later  utter silence. Still trembling  Alondra peered around her. No damage to the house where she was  but others around her were destroyed. She drove back to the mobile home park and found her home obliterated. Her Chihuahua was cowering under some rubble. Alondra heard about Samaritan’s Purse disaster relief at a nearby church and asked for help. On a blustery New Year’s Day  our volunteers cleared debris  chainsawed downed trees  and neatly assembled her belongings. As the work was winding down  Team Leader Bill Burden talked with Alondra and shared how much God loves her and how Jesus Christ had died for her sins. Alondra prayed to receive Him as her Savior. As the 18 volunteers circled up to present a Bible to Alondra  Bill announced to the group: “I want to introduce you to a new sister in Jesus Christ.” They clapped and cheered. Alondra’s smile beamed. “This is a special morning ” Alondra said afterward. “Definitely  definitely. God spared me because He knew you guys were coming today.”  Please pray that Alondra will grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. That when future disasters strike  our volunteers will minister with strength and sensitivity. That God will give our U.S. Disaster Relief Team wisdom to lead this vital ministry.

Each morning  the men travel to the nearby river readying their nets and hand-dug canoes hoping to catch enough fish to feed their families. So far  Samaritan’s Purse has trained 500 men on improved fishing techniques. They also received hooks and twine to weave fishing nets  a process that takes about three weeks to complete. For these men  fishing is the primary means of earning a living and providing food for their families  as the conflict in South Sudan has all but eliminated the opportunity to plant and harvest crops. An estimated 3.9 million people are now considered “severely food insecure.” Though South Sudan  the world’s youngest nation  continues to experience tragedies of war and violence  good things are still taking place here. Leno Machar  one of the project participants  shares: “We used to sell our livestock to buy twine to make nets and fishing hooks  but the harvest was so bad last year we had to sell all our cattle in order to buy food. We are very grateful to be part of this group and receive twine to make nets and fishing hooks. It means we will be able to feed our families and even sell the extra fish in the market to bring extra income so we can buy other grains and household items.” The project is not only equipping men to learn a valuable trade to sustain their families  it’s also demonstrating the Lord’s compassion and provision as His love is extended and demonstrated. “When [Jesus] had stopped speaking  He said to Simon  'Launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch'" (Luke 5:4).  Please pray that the fishermen are able to catch enough fish to provide for their families and earn a living. That peace would come soon to South Sudan and that the people will come to know true peace offered only by God through Jesus Christ. For safety and protection of the Samaritan’s Purse team working in South Sudan.

Typically they caused no major damage  but on April 10  2007  a mortar hit the trailer where he was working  right outside the hospital’s main gate. The attack sent him flying off his chair and through a plywood door. “It was the wrong place  wrong time ” he said. The blast injured Justin’s brain  and his left leg sustained severe nerve damage  which continues to cause him constant pain. Today he uses a wheelchair  sometimes a cane. Because of his mobility issues  as well as social anxiety caused by post-traumatic stress disorder  he rarely goes out. On top of that  Justin suffered a stroke on Mother’s Day 2014. When he and his wife Christina were accepted for a week of Bible-based marriage enrichment training in Alaska with our Operation Heal Our Patriots ministry  the couple felt it would stretch Justin out of his post-injury comfort zone. Their thinking proved correct  and the experience—bonding with his wife  nine other couples  and our staff—did push Justin in a good way. “This was a big personal step to come up here ” he said. Physically  he engaged by participating in outdoor activities. Emotionally  he connected with Christina  and they recommitted themselves to their marriage vows. Spiritually  the Lord touched his heart through the teaching from our chaplains. Most important  he rejoiced to see Christina receive Jesus Christ as her Lord and Savior and get baptized under the waters of Lake Clark. “It was something that I wanted for her  but I didn’t know how to go about it ” he said. “I gave myself to the Lord on this trip ” Christina said. “It’s been great for our marriage.”   Please pray for Justin  Christina  and their three children to grow together in the Christian faith. For the hundreds of patriot couples who will be attending a reunion April 1-3. For the upcoming Operation Heal Our Patriots summer season  which opens May 29.

Though born blind  she was nonetheless a miracle to her mother  who previously suffered three miscarriages. Miracle lives in a crowded house with her aunt and 13 cousins in an impoverished neighborhood of Belize City  the largest town in the tiny Central American nation of Belize. She clutched the arm of her 12-year-old cousin Primalee as they walked into an unfinished concrete-block building that serves as a youth outreach ministry center for Calvary Baptist Church. The church stands on a street corner that divides rival gangs and used to be a Muslim prayer center for Asian merchants in Belize. Miracle and Primalee were among the 200 neighborhood children who flocked to the church to hear the Gospel message presented by local musicians  a red-nosed clown named Ozzie  and an evangelist who explained to them why we all need a Savior. Then each boy and girl received a gift filled Operation Christmas Child shoebox. Miracle sees through her fingertips. She learned to read Braille at age four and is one of the top students in her class. When she recognized the voice of Ozzie the Clown  a local TV personality  she insisted on touching his nose. When she opened her shoebox  she enjoyed her gifts her own special way—the cuddly softness of a baby doll  the fascinating shape of a spiral straw  the sweet taste of hard candy  and the fresh waxy smell of new crayons. And when the evangelist presented the invitation  Miracle and Primalee were among the children who stood with their heads bowed  eyes closed  and hands folded in prayer to accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior. “But to all who did receive him  who believed in his name  he gave the right to become children of God” (John 1:12  ESV).  Please pray for precious children like Miracle to know God’s sustaining love in their lives. For Belize to be transformed through a generation of children who have heard the Gospel as they received shoebox gifts. For the worldwide ministry of Operation Christmas Child  which has reached millions of children in more than 100 countries with the true meaning of Christmas.

As an adult  she found companionship in the man who became her husband. After 17 years of marriage and three children  she gave birth to another child  Thiago. To Juanita’s dismay  he was born with a congenital heart defect. The challenge of his medical condition caused her to feel alone again in her struggles. Eventually  Juanita brought Thiago to the Children's Heart Project office in La Paz  where he was accepted for surgery in Canada. Juanita had to leave her family to undertake a long journey to try to save Thiago’s life. What she didn’t know was that amidst this season of suffering  pain  and fear  she was experiencing the love of a parent she had never known  her Heavenly Father. Through the interpreter who traveled with them from Bolivia  Juanita heard the Good News of Jesus Christ. The Spirit of God touched her heart  and she recognized her need for a Savior. She began to feel a surprising embrace. Through her Canadian host family and host church  she felt God’s love and He became more real in her life. “It was incredible receiving so much love and care from people who did not know me ” Juanita said. “I believe God Himself was demonstrating His love  using all of these people.” Thiago’s heart surgery was a success. Today  he is a healthy 3-yearold child who can talk  run  and jump. As for Juanita  she has a new eternal heart as well. Even though she continues to experience life’s difficulties  she is actively aware of God’s blessings in her life. Juanita regularly attends a local church and is active in a women’s Bible study. “I believe I am another person ” she said. “God has changed me. Now  I can laugh  and now I can love my children like God  my Father  loves me.”  Please pray That Thiago will continue to grow in health and will experience God’s love from his mother. That Juanita will “grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ” (2 Peter 3:18). That other children who receive surgery through Children’s Heart Project—and  their families—will experience physical and spiritual healing.

Samaritan’s Purse contributed directly to one of those projects—and witnessed the other. More than 225 Samaritan’s Purse volunteers from around the United States teamed with local residents and worked throughout the summer to construct a new dormitory and administrative building  for the seminary. Equipped now with additional classrooms and dormitory space  even more men and women can receive training in God’s Word and be sent out to reach more Alaskans for the Savior. A dedication ceremony was held in Bethel on Oct. 16. Bethel is located on the tundra of southwestern Alaska  400 miles west of Anchorage. The new dormitory was dedicated in memory of Ruth Bell Graham  the late wife of Evangelist Billy Graham. Even though Mrs. Graham died in June 2007  her dedication to studying and obeying God’s Word is still making an impact for Christ nearly 5 000 miles away from where she lived in western North Carolina. The dedication plaque included one of her often attributed quotes: “Down through the years  I’ve turned to the Bible and found in it all I need.” “Ruth Bell Graham had such a strong history with Bible education  and it seemed only appropriate that we dedicate this new dormitory in her memory ” said Ed Dehnert  seminary president. Earlier in the year  Samaritan’s Purse leaders witnessed the dedication of the completely translated Bible in the Yupik language  indigenous to this region. “The Yupik people are very devout in their walk with Christ ” said Luther Harrison  Vice President for North American Ministries for Samaritan’s Purse. “Now they have the full Word of God. What an honor to witness what God is doing.”  Please pray that God will send the right students to the seminary for training in God’s Word. That more men  women and children throughout Alaska will be reached for Jesus—especially among those Native Alaskans who speak the Yupik language. That God will continue to lead Samaritan’s Purse with respect to Alaska building projects.

A famous polar explorer scientist and diplomat  Nansen was a visionary for refugee rights  directing the successful return of 450 000 prisoners of war to their homes after the First World War.    Nansen created the "Nansen Passport"  a revolutionary response to the lack of identity documents amongst hundreds of thousands of post-war refugees.   Following his crucial work to save millions of lives during the famine in Russia  Nansen was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1922.   An outspoken supporter of burden sharing amongst nations  Nansen believed states should do their fair share to find solutions for families forced to flee.

His family fled Syria and were able to settle in Budapest because his father  physician Anas  first came to Hungary in Communist times as a medical student. Dr. Nazer  who speaks Hungarian and retained some ties from his student days  watched the situation deteriorating in Damascus and applied for Hungarian visas for himself  his wife Lelas and their five children.  “We were hoping that by some miracle we could stay in Syria ” Mohamad said. “But when a huge bomb exploded right by our house  we knew it was time to leave. All the windows were blown out and the building was shaking.”  “We are lucky. There were no arrests in our family and we did not lose anyone. Other Syrians have suffered much more and we are glad to help them.”  Last summer  at the height of the refugee influx  the phone kept ringing in the Nazer household  as fellow Syrians got in touch to say they were in Hungary.

For almost a quarter of a century Kenya has played an extraordinary role in providing asylum to people forced to flee persecution and war. The safety of hundreds of thousands of Somalis  South Sudanese and others has hinged on Kenya’s generosity and its willingness to be a leading beacon in the East Africa region for international protection. Tragically  the situations in Somalia and South Sudan that cause people to flee are still unresolved today.  We recognise the many consequences that being a major refugee hosting nation has had for Kenya and its population  and we have been a prominent advocate for robust international support for the country.  The closure of Kenya's refugee camps could have potentially devastating consequences for 600 000 people. We appeal to the Government of Kenya to reconsider its decision and to avoid taking any action that might be at odds with its international obligations towards people needing sanctuary from danger and persecution.

The gesture showed solidarity with the world's refugees at a time when millions are fleeing war and persecution worldwide  and was a proud moment for the 27-year-old refugee and athlete  who resumed swimming and basketball last year in Greece after his promising sports career in Syria was cut short by war -- and a 2012 bombing that amputated his right leg below the knee. Ibrahim now walks with a prosthetic.  Hundreds of refugees gathered around Ibrahim as he walked with the flame held high through Eleonas  the Athens center which houses some 1 500 asylum-seekers.

"The magnitude of this particular crisis shows us unmistakably that it cannot be business as usual  leaving the greatest burden to be carried by the countries closest to the conflict " Grandi told a high-level conference in Geneva.

Now  only one is enough  most of the time.   In 1972  there was a big frost. It was freezing. Everybody left the district and went to seek refuge on the coast. Right after that winter  it was very warm and it has been hot ever since. So after El Nino  when the drought came and then the frost  people here were lost. We didn’t know what to do – noone was prepared for that. Noone was used to being that cold. All my crops were destroyed. The kaukau (sweet potatoes) were rotting in the ground. All the plants got burnt by the drought  then the frost  and I lost everything.  For more than one week we had nothing to eat. We were suffering in silence. Then the government came and gave us some rice  and then the World Food Programme came. So now we are ok  but we still do not know what to expect.

I live in Denmark now with two of my younger brothers  Issam and Mohammed.   We had everything in Syria. We had two dairy factories. In my home  we had cats  dogs  birds  horses. My mother would make bread on the terrace. It was so delicious. She was very good at that. We had everything we wanted. But it was all destroyed.   I felt like I should do something to help in Syria. I wanted to help my friends and my family - and all the Syrian people are my family. I drove ambulances  medicine and food to people across the Turkish border into Syria. I bought the food from the local market in Syria and not in Turkey  because it is good for the Syrian people that we buy from them.  I tried to give people the most important food – like rice and olive oil  sugar and tea.   The first time I was delivering food  I was so nervous. What should I say? I wanted to show them that I am exactly like them. I didn’t know how to knock on the door or how to tell them to take the food. It is hard to say how they felt when they received the food; they were happy and ashamed at the same time  and so was I.  Giving food meant a lot to me. When you give food to people  they feel alive and can do something. Food is the most important gift in life because it is life.   In 2015  I couldn’t help in Syria anymore  I couldn’t get a job  and I couldn’t study. That’s why I chose Europe to start my life again. I traveled to Izmir first and I found a smuggler to go to Mytilini on the Greek Island of Lesbos.  People had told me Denmark is a good country to go to because the people are very friendly and the life here is good. When we got to Europe  I started the travel to Denmark with my two brothers.  Now we are living in a shared house in Solrød Kommune. We are better now  of course  but how should we continue?  When you live outside of your country  you are just a number. As a refugee  people look at you like you are less than them…but I am not. I was rich. I was studying. I had a job. I had everything. I am like you. A war started. It is not my fault  and I am not less than you are.” #IamSyrian  ©WFP/ Ingrid Erno  panorama.wfp.org/iamsyrian

I am a daughter  a wife and a mother to triplets  my three musketeers.   We came to Sweden three years ago as refugees from Damascus  Syria. Nowadays we live in Teckomatorp  a small village outside of Malmö.  We left Syria to protect ourselves  our children and our future. Sometimes I feel very ashamed and guilty because I managed to leave with my family and children. When we left  my mum and dad were still in Syria  but they died last year  they were very sick. My mum died from cancer and my father died six months later - he was depressed after my mum’s death.  In Damascus  in 2000  I volunteered for the Syrian Red Crescent and became a first aider in 2001. I especially remember one day when we were in the ambulance and we came to a checkpoint. They pointed their weapons at us  we couldn’t go past them. We could hear shooting but we were not allowed to give help.   On my birthday in November 2012  my friends asked me if I wished to travel  and I said no  I wouldn’t want to leave Syria in a thousand years. Six months later  I had to. I didn’t want to leave  but I wanted my kids and my family to be safe.  It was only when I came to Sweden that I realised that I am a refugee and I am not able to go back home.   I am wearing colourful clothes because in our culture we say that pink breaks deep sadness. That’s why I wear a pink scarf. This is very different from what is inside me now – there is a lot of pain  and there is a lot of stress.  We are waiting for Syria to be a free and peaceful country  which our people deserve. Then we might want to come back home. Although  we really do feel home again in Sweden. I feel guilty because… Syria is my country  the place of my dreams.

Scientists now know that malnutrition in the first two years of life (the first 1 000 days from conception) can affect mental and physical development into adulthood.

Here's a statement from NRDC president Rhea Suh:   “We tell the story of who we are through our national treasures  and the president’s decision represents a new definition of inclusivity for our national parks.

Sadly  the tragedies that are unfolding before our eyes are just a fraction of the violence that has been happening off camera in our nation for far too long.    The Sierra Club believes all people deserve a healthy planet with clean air and water  a stable climate and safe communities. That means all people deserve equal protection under the law and the right to a life free of discrimination  hatred and violence. Unfortunately  those aspirations and goals are not a reality in our country  and that is why the Sierra Club stands in solidarity with all of those saying #BlackLivesMatter  demanding justice  accountability  and action to confront the racism and inequality that has allowed these tragedies to persist. We can do better and by standing together to work for the changes that are needed  we will.”  Showing Up for Racial Justice (SURJ) has ways to help.

He wanted his mom to have time to do more important things. He wanted his sister to be able to go to school too.  And not only did he give time back to his family in the same way that clean water would  but he also set an example for the other boys in his community.  Collecting water requires hours of painful work for women around the world every single day. But we can help change that. We can bring clean water into these communities and significantly lighten the load for women (and boys like Devison) so all of them can focus on more important things: like each other.

Despite his small bony frame  Devison started walking for water so the women he cared about most wouldn’t have to.  “I walk for water because I believe in gender equality. There must be no discrimination between boys and girls in relation to chores.”

Women walk to locations outside their village— river beds and holes in the ground— and take turns collecting water using pans or ladles. It’s a brutally slow process that can take hours. Especially when they have to wait in line.  Women and girls are making this trip  with forty pounds of water on their head  no less than five times each day.  Devison saw it all around him. And he refused to do nothing while his mother and sister shouldered the burden of this work. So one day  Devison started walking for water too.

We are here for you 24/7 at 866-488-7386.   "The importance of establishing laws that focus on the #LGBTQ+ population cannot be overstated  as LGB youth are four times more likely to attempt suicide than their heterosexual peers and between 40 percent and 50 percent of #transgender individuals will attempt suicide at some point in their lifetime. With the enactment of #Bill21361  there is now model legislative language that other jurisdictions can use to implement similar policies in their schools. In fact  California has already held a hearing on a similar bill requiring middle and high schools to adopt suicide prevention policies that specifically address the needs of LGBTQ youth  among other high-risk subgroups."  http://ow.ly/4nsgLK

"For me it is about the children…" said Maisie Williams. "Children with so much potential  so many hopes and dreams. Where is the humanity that makes it acceptable for them to languish in refugee camps – in Europe?"   As for Liam Cunningham  his call focused on EU leaders: "This is not an earthquake  this is not a tidal wave. This is a man-made crisis. 57 000 stranded in Greece. Refugee camps in Europe? Is this truly the standard EU leaders want to set as the way to respond to the global refugee crisis?"

More than 1 million Syrian refugees have fled to neighboring Lebanon to escape their country's violent civil war. Many of the refugees have settled in urban areas rather than traditional refugee camps. Noticeably  there has been an increase in the number of children--mainly Syrian refugee children--working in the streets of Lebanon's major cities. Some are trying to help their families in desperate need; others have been separated from their families and are forced to fend for themselves. Still others must support siblings and even send money back to relatives who remain in Syria. The majority of them have discontinued their education at a critical time in their development  putting an entire generation at risk  with grave consequences for the future.

Of the approximately 53 000 refugees still stranded in Greece since the EU-Turkey Deal went into effect two months ago  about 22 000 are children. Many of those children are traveling alone.  It is vital that vulnerable groups  such as unaccompanied children  receive adequate support immediately  yet most remain living in refugee camps where access to specialized services is limited.  We continue to call on EU leaders to do more for refugees including ensuring that those currently stranded in Greece are living in conditions that meet humanitarian standards.

As children flee war in Syria to seek safety in neighboring Jordan  some children embark on a journey alone or with their siblings. As these unaccompanied children arrive  they are referred to IRC’s child protection program in Azraq refugee camp. The team of some 64 aid workers—which includes 36 Syrian volunteers who are refugees themselves—is on hand 24 hours a day  seven days a week to welcome and care for them  try to locate their relatives and  if necessary  identify potential foster parents.   More than 3 000 such children have crossed into Jordan since 2012. An estimated 94% have been reunited with their families.  At Azraq  we encourage children to express themselves through art in order to help them cope with the trauma they have experienced.    15-year old Hiba  for instance  lost both parents and her younger sister to bombings in Syria. She and her three younger brothers were able to escape to Azraq where they are waiting to be reunited with their grandmother and uncle. The following pictures are of her drawings.

Refugees have been resettled in the state for many years and have been a vital part of its growth and diversity.  “The Governor’s claim that security processes remain inadequate is patently false. Refugees are subject to a range of rigorous and thorough security checks  including the use of Biometrics and name checks against a robust set of databases. The vetting system has been methodically structured to both safeguard the security of the U.S. and provide protection to those who need it most  and to whom we have a moral obligation to protect.   “As Governor Christie turns his back on the world's most vulnerable  the IRC will step up and ensure that refugees receive the services they are entitled to.”    Learn more: http://bit.ly/1WItxfy

"We hope the Pope’s message of solidarity will have an impact on the hearts and minds of European policy-makers " said our Deputy Director in Greece Jane Waite.  The Pope's gesture sends a strong message of the importance of the relocation program which is far behind expectations. The EU had set an overall target of 160 000 relocations-- about 6 000 a month. Since the EU-Turkey deal was signed on March 26th  only 46 people have been relocated.  Following the strong gesture of humanity towards refugees by the Pope  we urge EU policy makers  and the world  not to forget the 53 000 refugees who remain in Greece. Truth is  long-term solutions need to be sought. We're calling for a resettlement program where 100 000 refugees are resettled every year for the next five years.

She had consistent values of diversity and people. Her grace  boldness  and steadiness are unmatched. Kisha had a gift for helping people see their own truth and other people’s truth to be the best version of themselves. She always modeled the importance of balancing head and heart in our leadership. Kisha helped shape our culture and strengthened all of our efforts at Teach For America. She has left a lasting legacy within our community.   We share our profound sadness with Kisha’s family.

We’re teaching them how to take better care of the livestock they depend on for food and income  and how to grow nutritious vegetables in home gardens. We also facilitate mother care groups  like this one  so mothers can learn how to prepare healthy meals with the crops they grow  and about other things that will keep their families strong.

I don’t have a refrigerator and they would go bad very quickly ” she says.   But Mercy Corps provided Maria Flor with seeds and training to start her own organic garden  and now her family has an abundance of fresh  organic produce at their fingertips. The garden has helped them supplement starchy primary food sources like rice  yucca and potatoes. And Maria Flor has noticed a big change in her family. “A big difference. Because now they are more nutritious  they eat better ” she says. “He's [the youngest grandchild] a lot better. He’s gained weight  he’s more active.”

Please join the conversation. What the media is doing in SF is amazing. But please do more than just promote your own organization or try and spin the conversation to drive traffic to your website.    Poverty and homelessness is far too big for any one organization to end by itself. We need to support other organizations and even other cities in the fight to end homelessness.

That a lot of people look down on her. That guys proposition her with money to go home with them. She's had soda thrown on her while sleeping.   Although graphic  Arien shares the realities of what women have to endure while living on the streets. People yell at her to "sell her pussy" until she can get a job because to them that's better than sleeping on the ground.   Arien says she's lucky to wake up without being robbed overnight. Her phone gets getting stolen. Along with not being able to shower  Arien says not having a regular phone makes it hard to find a job. To make matters worse  she says the shelters are even worse than the streets.   It's amazing that this young woman can still smile!  ________________________________________________  This important journey cannot continue without YOUR help.

Joseph said last year he spent the whole winter outside with temperatures as low as -40.  He went on to say "it's not like I am doing it on purpose. I have been waiting for a decent place to stay".   At one time Joseph was in housing  but the housing was so bad he didn't feel safe and he walked away from it.  When I asked Joseph how services can help someone like himself he simply responded by getting him a place to live where he feels safe and doesn't have to fear others.   I know some people think that any housing is better than the streets. I also know that most every community has challenges in finding affordable housing and good landlords that will accept housing vouchers.  But putting people into situations that are dangerous to a person's health or safety has to stop! WE can do better. We must do better!

Add to that Walt is a homeless veteran and a senior  he should not be on the streets of Silicon Valley.  Walt refuses to accept any kind of public assistance. He believes that type of support should go to women and families who need it. Instead  Walt plays his flute to raise the money he needs.

Real truth is homeless people know every service. The issue is the services is not a fit or is not avaiable.

Travelers are a subculture of the homeless population often known for hopping trains. You’ve seen them hanging out in your city. They almost have a uniform wearing brown clothes and often have dogs and musical instruments.  Many are kids that have been "thrown away" by their families and find community traveling with others.   I used to think no one wants to be homeless  and that is the truth for the vast majority of people sleeping outside. Even the ones who tell you that want to be homeless  at one time tried to get out of homelessness  but after hitting so many barriers  they just give up. It's called "learned helplessness."   But now  after meeting a few people like John and Brenda  I have changed. There are a few people that want to live a nomadic lifestyle.   John and Brenda are a married couple that travels by choice. They normally go up and down California  but this time  they decided to head east a little and visit Austin during SXSW.   They start by telling a story of joining up with a group of hippies. A fun moment is when we chat a little about what's the difference between a hippie and a traveler. You'll have to watch for the answer.   While passing through San Antonio  police picked them up and placed them in detox for smoking marijuana. That's insane!  I love that their three wishes were so simple  but that's the traveling lifestyle. John and Brenda are great kids. I wish them safe travels on all of their journeys.
