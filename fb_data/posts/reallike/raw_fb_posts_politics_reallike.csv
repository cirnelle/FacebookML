India-Kenya ties have stood the test of time. Both our nations have had very strong people-to-people ties and both nations have successfully fought colonialism in the previous century.   My deliberations with President Uhuru Kenyatta will revolve around how India and Kenya can grow their bilateral cooperation. I envision better trade  commercial and cultural exchanges between India and Kenya. The potential is immense and together we seek to harness it.   In Nairobi  I will offer floral tributes to Mahatma Gandhi  who is widely revered in Kenya. I shall also pay tributes to Mzee Jomo Kenyatta  the first president of Kenya and a towering political figure of Africa.   The meeting of the India-Kenya business forum will be an important forum to elaborate more on the economic aspect of our relationship with Kenya.   A programme that I am keenly looking forward to join is an interaction with students at the Nairobi University.   In order to deepen ties with the diaspora  I will address a community programme on 10th July. There is also a meeting with Bharatwallah Alumni Association during the visit. Another programme is the handing over of ambulances and a model of Bhabhatron.

South Africa is an important strategic partner  with whom our ties are historical and deep-rooted.

He went to South Africa as a lawyer seeking work and returned to India as a strong voice for humanitarian values  who would go on to shape the history of humankind.   I will have the honour to visit Phoenix Settlement and Pietermaritzburg Station  two places very closely associated with Mahatma Gandhi’s stay in South Africa. A visit to South Africa is incomplete without remembering the beloved Madiba.  I will also be honoured to visit the Constitutional Hill and Nelson Mandela Foundation where I would pay my tributes to an icon of human history  who made his country and the world a much better place.  During my visit  I will meet President Zuma. I will also be meeting Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa  the Deputy President.   In an effort to boost our economic ties  I will speak at the India-South Africa business meet. Other programmes include a meeting with the Alumni Network in Durban and a reception hosted by the Mayor of Durban  at Durban City Hall.

Tax returns provide the public with its sole confirmation of the veracity of a candidate's representations regarding charities  priorities  wealth  tax conformance  and conflicts of interest.  Further  while not a likely circumstance  the potential for hidden inappropriate associations with foreign entities  criminal organizations  or other unsavory groups is simply too great a risk to ignore for someone who is seeking to become commander-in-chief.  Mr. Trump says he is being audited. So? There is nothing that prevents releasing tax returns that are being audited. Further  he could release returns for the years immediately prior to the years under audit. There is only one logical explanation for Mr. Trump's refusal to release his returns: there is a bombshell in them. Given Mr. Trump's equanimity with other flaws in his history  we can only assume it's a bombshell of unusual size.  (Anticipating inquiries regarding my own tax release history  I released my 2010 tax returns in January of 2012 and I released my 2011 tax returns as soon as they were completed  in September of 2012.)

For many years  Bob has been a friend and a counselor. When I ran for public office  he spent hours with me  offering advice and sharing his experience. When I moved to Utah to take responsibility for the 2002 Olympic Winter Games  he helped me navigate the government agencies and U.S. Senate committees to secure essential resources that would make the Games successful. His keen mind made him a leading figure in the Senate on issues as disparate and far-reaching as emerging technologies and federal budgets. He was respected by men and women on both sides of the aisle  not only for his expertise but also for his common touch  his common sense  and his commitment to uncommon virtues. What I will remember most about Senator Bennett is his unwavering commitment to principle; his is an example of integrity and character that will long live in the memories of all of us who knew him. God be with you  Bob  till we meet again at Jesus' feet.

Today  there is a contest between Trumpism and Republicanism. Through the calculated statements of its leader  Trumpism has become associated with racism  misogyny  bigotry  xenophobia  vulgarity and  most recently  threats and violence. I am repulsed by each and every one of these.    The only path that remains to nominate a Republican rather than Mr. Trump is to have an open convention. At this stage  the only way we can reach an open convention is for Senator Cruz to be successful in as many of the remaining nominating elections as possible.    I like Governor John Kasich. I have campaigned with him. He has a solid record as governor. I would have voted for him in Ohio. But a vote for Governor Kasich in future contests makes it extremely likely that Trumpism would prevail.   I will vote for Senator Cruz and I encourage others to do so as well  so that we can have an open convention and nominate a Republican.

Trump & Dan Scavino regarding the ''tweet' directed at the most corrupt Presidential candidate- ever.  DONALD J. TRUMP STATEMENT ON FALSE ACCUSATION FROM HILLARY CLINTON:   These false attacks by Hillary Clinton trying to link the Star of David with a basic star  often used by sheriffs who deal with criminals and criminal behavior  showing an inscription that says “Crooked Hillary is the most corrupt candidate ever” with anti-Semitism is ridiculous. Clinton  through her surrogates  is just trying to divert attention from the dishonest behavior of herself and her husband.   The real questions are  why was Bill Clinton meeting secretly with the US Attorney General on her case and where are the 33 000 missing emails and all of the other information missing from her case -  Why are there so many lies?  STATEMENT FROM TRUMP CAMPAIGN SOCIAL MEDIA DIRECTOR DAN SCAVINO:  The social media graphic used this weekend was not created by the campaign nor was it sourced from an anti-Semitic site. It was lifted from an anti-Hillary Twitter user where countless images appear.   The sheriff’s badge – which is available under Microsoft’s “shapes” - fit with the theme of corrupt Hillary and that is why I selected it.    As the Social Media Director for the campaign  I would never offend anyone and therefore chose to remove the image.

In his speech yesterday  "Declaring American Economic Independence " Donald J. Trump made the case for Americanism over Hillary Clinton's Globalism  and detailed how the Trans-Pacific Partnership would undermine U.S. sovereignty and economic prosperity. He announced he would withdraw from the TPP and negotiate bilateral trade deals that protect U.S. economic interests. He then challenged Hillary Clinton  longtime enthusiastic booster of the TPP  if she too would pledge to withdraw from the pact and rule out its passage in any form. Clinton now weakly says she only has issues with the TPP "currently...in its current form " politician-speak for saying she will approve it at the very earliest opportunity. This would follow her same pattern of behavior on the Columbia and South Korea trade deals.Good luck though finding her for an answer: it’s been 208 days since she last held a press conferences  Relevant excerpt follows below. Read the full footnoted speech here: "Declaring American Economic Independence"   TRUMP: "The TPP creates a new international commission that makes decisions the American people are no longer given the right to veto. These commissions are great for Hillary’s Wall Street funders  who can spend vast amounts of money to influence the people on the commissions and the outcomes.  It should be no surprise  then  that Hillary Clinton  according to Bloomberg  took a leading part in drafting the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Please remember that  especially in November.  She praised or pushed the TPP on 45 separate occasions  and even called it the gold standard. Hillary Clinton was totally for the TPP just a short while ago.  But when she saw my stance — which is totally against — she was shamed into saying she would be against it  too. And I will tell you  it was the same shame that she had recently where she was sort of forced into saying radical “Islamic terrorism ” which she didn’t want to say  but she was shamed into that.  But have no doubt that she will immediately approve it  if it is put before her. And that is guaranteed. Guaranteed.  She will do this  just as she has betrayed American workers for Wall Street and throughout — throughout her career. Her whole career she has betrayed the American worker. She is trying to put on a good front now  she will betray you again.  Her career and her husband have signed so many disasters and never  ever forget NAFTA. Just never ever forget it  because you know what it’s done and I know what it’s done. And in touring  I’ve seen the devastation that it’s left behind.  Here’s how it would go. She would make a small token change  declare the TPP Pact fixed and ram it through and you will suffer. That is why Hillary is now only saying she has problems with TPP in its current form.  You know what that means. That means like they will make a little two-word change and she will fix it and she will feel great. But she says in its current form  she can rush to embrace it again and she will at the earliest opportunity. If the media doesn’t believe me  I have a challenge for you and Hillary. Ask Hillary if she is willing to withdraw from the TPP her first day in office and unconditionally rule out its passage in any form."

In a posting on its web site  MSNBC said Mateen swore allegiance to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.” (Timothy Ahmann  “Suspected Orlando Shooter Called 911  Swore Allegiance To Islamic State: NBC ” Reuters  6/12/16) This Is Consistent With Clinton’s Past Denials Of Radical Islam  Clinton Refuses To Categorize Terror As “Radical Islam.” ABC’S GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: “You’ve also been reluctant to say we’re fighting radical Islam. I wonder why not. Isn’t it a mistake to not say it plain that the violence is being pushed by radical elements in that faith?” CLINTON: “Well  that’s a different thing. Radical elements who use a dangerous and distorted view of Islam to promote their jihadist ambitions  I’m fine with that. I say it all the time. And I go after Islamists  too.” STEPHANOPOULOS: “So what’s the problem with radical Islam?” CLINTON: “Well  the problem is that that sounds like we are declaring a war against religion. And that  to me  is number one  wrong.” (ABC’s “This Week ” 12/6/15)

This money is a contribution made in order to 'Make America Great Again.”  Mr. Trump has fully extinguished (terminated) this loan per his commitment. Therefore  he has personally invested in excess of $50 million dollars in the future of our country.

Mr. Trump will continue to put America and our people first.

Instead they have become part of the rigged system in Washington  D.C. that benefits only the insiders.  I believe their members will be voting for me in much larger numbers than for her.  Hillary Clinton and her husband have made hundreds of millions of dollars doing favors and selling access to Wall Street  special interests and oppressive foreign regimes. As Bernie Sanders said  “Why  over her political career  has Wall Street been the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?” They own Hillary Clinton and she will do whatever they tell her to.  Bernie Sanders is also 100% correct when he says that Hillary Clinton “vote[d] for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions of jobs.” Hillary supported NAFTA and she supported the trade deal with China  Vietnam  South Korea – and if elected will implement the TPP she loves so much – guaranteed.  While Secretary of State 'Hillary Clinton racked up a $1 trillion trade deficit with China – all while China was funneling a small fortune to Hillary via speaking fees paid to Bill.  On immigration  Hillary Clinton sides with Wall Street too. Bernie Sanders correctly warned that open borders “would substantially lower wages in this country ” and yet Hillary has put forward a plan that would completely open America’s borders in her first 100 days in office.  On energy  Hillary Clinton wants to shut down the coal mines  block the Keystone pipeline  and destroy millions of good union jobs through executive action.  Her massive proposed increase in taxes and regulations will also send millions of jobs overseas.  Hillary Clinton will economically destroy poor communities  African-American and Hispanic workers on trade  immigration  crime  energy  taxes  regulation and everything else.  Finally  union workers have long believed in having an open and free society. Yet Hillary takes money from regimes that support the murder of gays and the enslavement of women while pushing to bring people into America who want to do the exact same thing to our people. I only want to bring people into our country who will love and support everyone.  Hillary Clinton is the enemy of working people and is the best friend Wall Street ever had. I will fight harder for American workers than anyone ever has  and I will fight for their right to elect leaders who will do the same. I will be a president for ALL Americans.

A year ago  today  many of you joined me at Trump Tower in calling for real change in Washington  D.C. I am proud to say that with your support we are well on our way to Making America Great Again!  Since the moment I rode down the escalator on June 16th  2015  and decided to run for President  my campaign has been filled with nothing but excitement  dedication  and passion to change our country for the better – this is only the beginning of our movement.  I am honored and proud to lead our fight to put America first. This past year  I have travelled this great country and met many incredible Americans at our rallies. Yesterday in Atlanta  Georgia- we had a packed house of loving supporters. Even early on in our campaign  we had a record-setting rally in Mobile  Alabama  with over 30 000 attendees that joined our movement to Make America Great Again.  The Republican primary began with 17 experienced and talented candidates for President. At the Ronald Reagan Library on September 16th  your overwhelming support showed that our campaign had the message that resonated with hard- working Americans  and that DC-centric way of thinking is no longer capable of leading our country.  My campaign has been one of honesty and substance. We have created much-needed dialogue around the important issues facing our country. You’ve seen my leadership in setting the agenda this whole political season  on both sides of the aisle. We wouldn’t be talking about illegal immigration. We wouldn’t be talking about the drugs pouring in and the bad trade deals costing American jobs. We wouldn’t have called the terrorist attack in Orlando for what it is: radical Islamic terrorism. Politicians are all talk and no action.   The support of many wonderful Americans  led to resounding victories in the Republican Primary race  in which we beat the rigged political system and biased media with landslide victories. Our success began on February 9th  with an emphatic win in New Hampshire and reached a high point with our victory in South Carolina on February 20th. We had some tough losses along the way  but with your support we were able to bounce back and sweep the Connecticut  Delaware  Maryland  Pennsylvania and Rhode Island on April 26th  along with other monumental wins throughout the primary season. The best of which was our win in Indiana on May 3rd  which led to us being declared the presumptive nominee and make history!  The strong vote of confidence that American voters have placed in our message of Making America Great Again  has buoyed us to many victories and is truly heartwarming. While we are thankful for the phenomenal success we have enjoyed in the past year  we are just beginning! I could not be more thrilled as your presumptive Republican Presidential Nominee and to officially accept the GOP Nomination at the Convention in July. We must continue to strive towards beating Crooked Hillary in November and Making ALL of America Great Again!  Thank you again for your support.  Best Wishes    Donald J.

TRUMP ADDRESSES TERRORISM  IMMIGRATION  AND NATIONAL SECURITY  Thank you for joining me today.  This was going to be a speech on Hillary Clinton and how bad a President  especially in these times of Radical Islamic Terrorism  she would be.  Even her former Secret Service Agent  who has seen her under pressure and in times of stress  has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be president.  There will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time  and I will deliver that speech soon.  But today there is only one thing to discuss: the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders.  The attack on the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando  Florida  was the worst terrorist strike on our soil since September 11th  and the worst mass shooting in our country’s history.  So many people dead  so many people gravely injured  so much carnage  such a disgrace.  The horror is beyond description.  The families of these wonderful people are totally devastated. Likewise  our whole nation  and indeed the whole world  is devastated.  We express our deepest sympathies to the victims  the wounded  and their families.  We mourn  as one people  for our nation’s loss – and pledge our support to any and all who need it.  I would like to ask now that we all observe a moment of silence for the victims of the attack.  Our nation stands together in solidarity with the members of Orlando's LGBT Community.  This is a very dark moment in America’s history.  A radical Islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub not only because he wanted to kill Americans  but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens because of their sexual orientation.  It is a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation.  It is an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives  love who they want and express their identity.  It is an attack on the right of every single American to live in peace and safety in their own country.  We need to respond to this attack on America as one united people – with force  purpose and determination.  But the current politically correct response cripples our ability to talk and think and act clearly.  If we don't get tough  and we don't get smart – and fast – we're not going to have a country anymore -- there will be nothing left.  The killer  whose name I will not use  or ever say  was born to Afghan parents who immigrated to the United States. His father published support for the Afghan Taliban  a regime which murders those who don’t share its radical views. The father even said he was running for President of that country.  The bottom line is that the only reason the killer was in America in the first place was because we allowed his family to come here.  That is a fact  and it's a fact we need to talk about.  We have a dysfunctional immigration system which does not permit us to know who we let into our country  and it does not permit us to protect our citizens.  We have an incompetent administration  and if I am not elected President  that will not change over the next four years -- but it must change  and it must change now.  With fifty people dead  and dozens more wounded  we cannot afford to talk around the issue anymore -- we have to address it head on.  I called for a ban after San Bernardino  and was met with great scorn and anger but now  many are saying I was right to do so -- and although the pause is temporary  we must find out what is going on. The ban will be lifted when we as a nation are in a position to properly and perfectly screen those people coming into our country.  The immigration laws of the United States give the President the power to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons that the President deems detrimental to the interests or security of the United States  as he deems appropriate.  I will use this power to protect the American people. When I am elected  I will suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States  Europe or our allies  until we understand how to end these threats.  After a full  impartial and long overdue security assessment  we will develop a responsible immigration policy that serves the interests and values of America.  We cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country  many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer.  Many of the principles of Radical Islam are incompatible with Western values and institutions.  Radical Islam is anti-woman  anti-gay and anti-American.  I refuse to allow America to become a place where gay people  Christian people  and Jewish people  are the targets of persecution and intimidation by Radical Islamic preachers of hate and violence.  It’s not just a national security issue. It is a quality of life issue.  If we want to protect the quality of life for all Americans – women and children  gay and straight  Jews and Christians and all people – then we need to tell the truth about Radical Islam.  We need to tell the truth  also  about how Radical Islam is coming to our shores.  We are importing Radical Islamic Terrorism into the West through a failed immigration system -- and through an intelligence community held back by our president.  Even our own FBI Director has admitted that we cannot effectively check the backgrounds of the people we are letting into America.  All of the September 11th hijackers were issued visas.  Large numbers of Somali refugees in Minnesota have tried to join ISIS.  The Boston Bombers came here through political asylum.  The male shooter in San Bernardino – again  whose name I won't mention -- was the child of immigrants from Pakistan  and he brought his wife – the other terrorist - from Saudi Arabia  through another one of our easily exploited visa programs.  Immigration from Afghanistan into the United States has increased nearly five-fold in just one year. According to Pew Research  99% of people in Afghanistan support oppressive Sharia Law.  We admit many more from other countries in the region who share these same oppressive views.  If we want to remain a free and open society  then we have to control our borders.  Yet  Hillary Clinton – for months and despite so many attacks – repeatedly refused to even say the words “radical Islam ” until I challenged her yesterday to say the words or leave the race.  However  Hillary Clinton – who has been forced to say the words today after policies she supports have caused us so much damage – still has no clue what Radical Islam is  and won’t speak honestly about what it is.  She is in total denial  and her continuing reluctance to ever name the enemy broadcasts weakness across the world.  In fact  just a few weeks before the San Bernardino slaughter  Hillary Clinton explained her refusal to say the words Radical Islam. Here is what she said: “Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people  and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism.”  Hillary Clinton says the solution is to ban guns. They tried that in France  which has among the toughest gun laws in the world  and 130 were brutally murdered by Islamic terrorists in cold blood. Her plan is to disarm law-abiding Americans  abolishing the 2nd amendment  and leaving only the bad guys and terrorists with guns. She wants to take away Americans’ guns  then admit the very people who want to slaughter us.  I will be meeting with the NRA  which has given me their earliest endorsement in a Presidential race  to discuss how to ensure Americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror.  The bottom line is that Hillary supports the policies that bring the threat of Radical Islam into America  and allow it to grow overseas.  In fact  Hillary Clinton’s catastrophic immigration plan will bring vastly more Radical Islamic immigration into this country  threatening not only our security but our way of life.  When it comes to Radical Islamic terrorism  ignorance is not bliss – it's deadly.  The Obama Administration  with the support of Hillary Clinton and others  has also damaged our security by restraining our intelligence-gathering and failing to support law enforcement. They have put political correctness above common sense  above your safety  and above all else.  I refuse to be politically correct.  I will do the right thing--I want to straighten things out and to Make America Great Again.  The days of deadly ignorance will end  and they will end soon.  As President I will give our intelligence community  law enforcement and military the tools they need to prevent terrorist attacks.  We need an intelligence-gathering system second to none. That includes better cooperation between state  local and federal officials – and with our allies.  I will have an Attorney General  a Director of National Intelligence  and a Secretary of Defense who will know how to fight the war on Radical Islamic Terrorism – and who will have the support they require to get the job done.  We also must ensure the American people are provided the information they need to understand the threat.  The Senate Subcommittee on Immigration has already identified hundreds of immigrants charged with terrorist activities inside the United States since September 11th.  Nearly a year ago  the Senate Subcommittee asked President Obama's Departments of Justice  State and Homeland Security to provide the immigration history of all terrorists inside the United States.  These Departments refused to comply.  President Obama must release the full and complete immigration histories of all individuals implicated in terrorist activity of any kind since 9/11.  The public has a right to know how these people got here.  We have to screen applicants to know whether they are affiliated with  or support  radical groups and beliefs.  We have to control the amount of future immigration into this country to prevent large pockets of radicalization from forming inside America.  Even a single individual can be devastating  just look at what happened in Orlando. Can you imagine large groups?  Truly  our President doesn't know what he is doing. He has failed us  and failed us badly  and under his leadership  this situation will not get any better -- it will only get worse.  Each year  the United States permanently admits more than 100 000 immigrants from the Middle East  and many more from Muslim countries outside the Middle East. Our government has been admitting ever-growing numbers  year after year  without any effective plan for our security.  In fact  Clinton's State Department was in charge of the admissions process for people applying to enter from overseas.  Having learned nothing from these attacks  she now plans to massively increase admissions without a screening plan  including a 500% increase in Syrian refugees.  This could be a better  bigger version of the legendary Trojan Horse.  We can't let this happen.  Altogether  under the Clinton plan  you'd be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East with no system to vet them  or to prevent the radicalization of their children.  The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should be increased without any effective system to screen who we are bringing in.  The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and lesbian Americans.  The burden is also on Hillary Clinton to tell us how she will pay for it. Her plan will cost Americans hundreds of billions of dollars long-term.  Wouldn't this money be better spent on rebuilding America for our current population  including the many poor people already living here?  We have to stop the tremendous flow of Syrian refugees into the United States – we don't know who they are  they have no documentation  and we don't know what they're planning.  What I want is common sense. I want a mainstream immigration policy that promotes American values.  That is the choice I put before the American people: a mainstream immigration policy designed to benefit America  or Hillary Clinton's radical immigration policy designed to benefit politically-correct special interests.  We've got to get smart  and tough  and vigilant  and we've got to do it now  because later is too late.  The media talks about “homegrown ” terrorism  but Islamic radicalism  and the networks that nurture it  are imports from overseas.  Yes  there are many radicalized people already inside our country as a result of the poor policies of the past. But the whole point is that it will be much  much easier to deal with our current problem if we don’t keep on bringing in people who add to the problem.  For instance  the controversial Mosque attended by the Boston Bombers had as its founder an immigrant from overseas charged in an assassination plot.  This shooter in Orlando was the child of an immigrant father who supported one of the most repressive regimes on Earth. Why would we admit people who support violent hatred?  Hillary Clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continues to support immigration policies that bring Islamic extremists to our country who suppress women  gays and anyone who doesn’t share their views.  She can’t have it both ways. She can’t claim to be supportive of these communities while trying to increase the number of people coming in who want to oppress them.  How does this kind of immigration make our life better? How does this kind of immigration make our country better?  Why does Hillary Clinton want to bring people here—in vast numbers—who reject our values?  Ask yourself  who is really the friend of women and the LGBT community  Donald Trump with his actions  or Hillary Clinton with her words? Clinton wants to allow Radical Islamic terrorists to pour into our country—they enslave women  and murder gays.  I don’t want them in our country.  Immigration is a privilege  and we should not let anyone into this country who doesn’t support our communities – all of our communities.  America has already admitted four times more immigrants than any country on earth  and we continue to admit millions more with no real checks or scrutiny.  Not surprisingly  wages for our workers haven’t budged in many years.  So whether it’s matter of national security  or financial security  we can’t afford to keep on going like this. We owe $19 trillion in debt  and no longer have options.  All our communities  from all backgrounds  are ready for some relief. This is not an act of offense against anyone; it is an act of defense.  I want us all to work together  including in partnership with our Muslim communities. But Muslim communities must cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad – and they do know where they are.  I want to fix our schools  roads  bridges and job market. I want every American to succeed. Hillary Clinton wants to empty out the Treasury to bring people into the country that include individuals who preach hate against our own citizens.  I want to protect our citizens – all of our citizens.  The terrorist attack on the Pulse Night Club demands a full and complete investigation into every aspect of the assault.  In San Bernardino  as an example  people knew what was going on  but they used the excuse of racial profiling for not reporting it.  We need to know what the killer discussed with his relatives  parents  friends and associates.  We need to know if he was affiliated with any radical Mosques or radical activists and what  if any  is their immigration status.  We need to know if he travelled anywhere  and who he travelled with.  We need to make sure every single last person involved in this plan – including anyone who knew something but didn't tell us – is brought to justice.  If it can be proven that somebody had information about any attack  and did not give this information to authorities  they must serve prison time .  America must do more – much more – to protect its citizens  especially people who are potential victims of crimes based on their backgrounds or sexual orientations.  It also means we must change our foreign policy.  The decision to overthrow the regime in Libya  then pushing for the overthrow of the regime in Syria  among other things  without plans for the day after  have created space for ISIS to expand and grow.  These actions  along with our disastrous Iran deal  have also reduced our ability to work in partnership with our Muslim allies in the region.  That is why our new goal must be to defeat Islamic terrorism  not nation-building.  For instance  the last major NATO mission was Hillary Clinton's war in Libya. That mission helped unleash ISIS on a new continent.  I've said NATO needs to change its focus to stopping terrorism. Since I've raised that criticism  NATO has since announced a new initiative focused on just that.  America must unite the whole civilized world in the fight against Islamic terrorism  just like we did against communism in the Cold War.  We've tried it President Obama's way. He gave the world his apology tour  we got ISIS  and many other problems  in return.  I'd like to conclude my remarks today by again expressing our solidarity with the people of Orlando who have come under attack.  When I am President  I pledge to protect and defend all Americans who live inside of our borders. Wherever they come from  wherever they were born  all Americans living here and following our laws will be protected.  America will be a tolerant and open society.  America will also be a safe society.  We will protect our borders at home.  We will defeat ISIS overseas.  We will ensure every parent can raise their children in peace and safety.  We will make America rich again.  We will make America safe again.  We will make American Great Again.  Thank you.

TRUMP STATEMENT REGARDING TRAGIC TERRORIST ATTACK IN ORLANDO  FLORIDA  Last night  our nation was attacked by a radical Islamic terrorist. It was the worst terrorist attack on our soil since 9/11  and the second of its kind in 6 months. My deepest sympathy and support goes out to the victims  the wounded  and their families.  In his remarks today  President Obama disgracefully refused to even say the words 'Radical Islam'. For that reason alone  he should step down. If Hillary Clinton  after this attack  still cannot say the two words 'Radical Islam' she should get out of this race for the Presidency.  If we do not get tough and smart real fast  we are not going to have a country anymore. Because our leaders are weak  I said this was going to happen – and it is only going to get worse. I am trying to save lives and prevent the next terrorist attack. We can't afford to be politically correct anymore.  The terrorist  Omar Mir Saddique Mateen  is the son of an immigrant from Afghanistan who openly published his support for the Afghanistani Taliban and even tried to run for President of Afghanistan. According to Pew  99% of people in Afghanistan support oppressive Sharia Law.  We admit more than 100 000 lifetime migrants from the Middle East each year. Since 9/11  hundreds of migrants and their children have been implicated in terrorism in the United States.  Hillary Clinton wants to dramatically increase admissions from the Middle East  bringing in many hundreds of thousands during a first term – and we will have no way to screen them  pay for them  or prevent the second generation from radicalizing.  We need to protect all Americans  of all backgrounds and all beliefs  from Radical Islamic Terrorism - which has no place in an open and tolerant society. Radical Islam advocates hate for women  gays  Jews  Christians and all Americans. I am going to be a President for all Americans  and I am going to protect and defend all Americans. We are going to make America safe again and great again for everyone.  - Donald J. Trump

The Israeli security forces’ investigation is ongoing  but some facts have already emerged — and they are grim.  Just as fast as the condolences arrive from the civilized world is the praise arising out of the uncivilized one. Hamas praised the attack  calling the attackers “heroes.” Reports out of Hebron indicate that residents of the terrorists’ hometown lit up the night sky with celebratory fireworks. One Palestinian “news organization” even referred to the shootings  in which the assailants dressed up as observant Jews  as a “Ramadan treat.” The leader of Hamas called the injured terrorist a “hero.” How despicable!  The American people stand strong with the people of Israel  who have suffered far too long from terrorism. Israel’s security is a matter of paramount importance to me and the American people.   We understand all too well the unspeakable horror that terrorism unleashes. To address it — and address it we must! — we must recognize the parallel horror of the culture of religious hatred that permeates many Palestinian quarters. From schools that indoctrinate toddlers to grow up to kill Israelis to the daily menu of hate that spews forth from various “news organizations ” change is long overdue in the Palestinian territories.  Let us begin the arduous task of creating a future where peace can take root and terror finds no refuge.    I express my deepest condolences to the families of the four Israelis who were murdered  as well as my wishes for a speedy recovery to the wounded.  Donald J. Trump

TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT  (Washington  DC) May 13  2016 – Today  nine Chairmen in the U.S. House of Representatives – Steve Chabot (Small Business)  Michael Conaway (Agriculture)  Jeb Hensarling (Financial Services)  Candice Miller (House Administration)  Jeff Miller (Veterans’ Affairs)  Tom Price (Budget)  Pete Sessions (Rules)  Bill Shuster (Transportation and Infrastructure)  and Lamar Smith (Science  Space and Technology) – endorsed Donald J. Trump for President and released the following statement:  “We stand on the precipice of one of the most important elections of our lifetime. This great nation cannot endure eight more years of Democrat-control of the White House. It cannot afford to put Democrats in charge of Congress. It is paramount that we coalesce around the Republican nominee  Mr. Donald J. Trump  and maintain control of both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate.”  “Any other outcome is a danger to economic growth  puts our national security in peril  enshrines ObamaCare as the law of the land  entraps Americans in a cycle of poverty and dependence  and undermines our constitutional republic.”  “There is a path to winning in November  and it comes through unity. To solidify this partnership  we endorse Mr. Trump as the Republican nominee for President and call upon all Americans to support him.”  In response  Mr. Trump released the following statement upon news of the endorsements:  “It is tremendous to be working with these leaders and their colleagues on winning solutions that will really move us forward. A strong House Republican Majority is imperative to fixing the problems facing America and making our country better and stronger than ever before.”  Mr. Trump has surged in recent polls against Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton  both nationally and in key battleground states such as Ohio  where he leads Clinton by a significant margin.

TRUMP  The United States cannot afford another four years of the Obama White House  which is what Hillary Clinton represents. That is why it’s critical that Republicans unite around our shared principles  advance a conservative agenda  and do all we can to win this fall. With that focus  we had a great conversation this morning. While we were honest about our few differences  we recognize that there are also many important areas of common ground. We will be having additional discussions  but remain confident there’s a great opportunity to unify our party and win this fall  and we are totally committed to working together to achieve that goal. We are extremely proud of the fact that many millions of new voters have entered the primary system  far more than ever before in the Republican Party's history. This was our first meeting  but it was a very positive step toward unification.

He was a poor representative and an embarrassment to the great people of South Carolina.

TRUMP RESPONSE TO CRUZ AND KASICH CAMPAIGNS  It is sad that two grown politicians have to collude against one person who has only been a politician for ten months in order to try and stop that person from getting the Republican nomination.  Senator Cruz has done very poorly and after his New York performance  which was a total disaster  he is in free fall and as everyone has seen  he does not react well under pressure. Also  approximately 80% of the Republican Party is against him. Governor Kasich  who has only won 1 state out of 41  in other words  he is 1 for 41 and he is not even doing as well as other candidates who could have stubbornly stayed in the race like him but chose not to do so. Marco Rubio  as an example  has more delegates than Kasich and yet suspended his campaign one month ago. Others  likewise  have done much better than Kasich  who would get slaughtered by Hillary Clinton once the negative ads against him begin. 85% of Republican voters are against Kasich.  Collusion is often illegal in many other industries and yet these two Washington insiders have had to revert to collusion in order to stay alive. They are mathematically dead and this act only shows  as puppets of donors and special interests  how truly weak they and their campaigns are. I have brought millions of voters into the Republican primary system and have received many millions of votes more than Cruz or Kasich. Additionally  I am far ahead of both candidates with delegates and would be receiving in excess of 60% of the vote except for the fact that there were so many candidates running against me.  Because of me  everyone now sees that the Republican primary system is totally rigged. When two candidates who have no path to victory get together to stop a candidate who is expanding the party by millions of voters  (all of whom will drop out if I am not in the race) it is yet another example of everything that is wrong in Washington and our political system. This horrible act of desperation  from two campaigns who have totally failed  makes me even more determined  for the good of the Republican Party and our country  to prevail!

And NATO really hasn’t found an effective way to combat this message.”

Trump has announced his New York State campaign organization  including Republican Party leaders in all 27 Congressional District across the state. The committee - comprised of GOP elected leaders  Republican county chairmen and other key party officials - represents the most powerful presidential campaign organization in the state.   Mr. Trump stated  "New York is my home and I am so proud to have been able to assemble such an incredible team. I have watched and known these people for so many years. They love New York and our country. Together we will Make America Great Again."   U.S. Congressman Chris Collins (R-NY)  Honorary Co-chairman of the campaign in New York  said “Donald Trump will bring back American jobs stolen by China  take on our enemies and help our children and grandchildren achieve the American Dream. If we want to deal with the grave issues threatening America's future  New York Republicans must reject the professional politicians. The American people want a Chief Executive in the White House  not a Chief Politician."   As Honorary Co-chairman  Carl P. Paladino  the 2010 Republican candidate for governor of New York and a Buffalo developer  has led organization of the state's Donald J. Trump for President campaign.

Here in Dutchess County  he has done great things  always keeping his word and delivering even more than he promises. What he has done for Dutchess  I know he can do for America  so I proudly stand with him as he works to Make America Great Again.”   Mr. Trump was honored to be joined by many of the 33 Republican County Chairs at his event in Bethpage on Wednesday night.

Lyin' Ted Cruz had the Governor of Wisconsin  many conservative talk radio show hosts  and the entire party apparatus behind him. Not only was he propelled by the anti-Trump Super PAC's spending countless millions of dollars on false advertising against Mr. Trump  but he was coordinating `with his own Super PAC's (which is illegal) who totally control him. Ted Cruz is worse than a puppet--- he is a Trojan horse  being used by the party bosses attempting to steal the nomination from Mr. Trump.   We have total confidence that Mr. Trump will go on to win in New York  where he holds a substantial lead in all the polls  and beyond. Mr. Trump is the only candidate who can secure the delegates needed to win the Republican nomination and ultimately defeat Hillary Clinton  or whomever is the Democratic nominee  in order to Make America Great Again.

Trump announced that Paul J. Manafort will serve as his campaign’s Convention Manager. Mr. Manafort is volunteering his considerable insight and expertise because of his belief that Mr. Trump is the right person for these difficult times. He will be responsible for transitioning the Trump campaign’s activities as they relate to Mr. Trump's nomination at the convention in Cleveland  Ohio.  Mr. Manafort’s experience spans over three decades of working on U.S. presidential campaigns  and includes work on conventions for Presidents Gerald Ford  Ronald Reagan  and George H.W. Bush  as well as Republican Presidential nominee  Bob Dole. Mr. Trump will use Mr. Manafort’s years of experience to support his efforts in all aspects of the convention as he closes in on the Republican nomination for President.  Currently  Mr. Manafort is an attorney and founding partner of DMP International  LLC where he has been active in business and international affairs for the last 20 years. Previously  he was a partner at BMS&K for 15 years and worked on dozens of international political campaigns in an effort to bring democratic expertise to foreign countries. He served as a director of OPIC following his appointment by President Reagan  and was on the Investment Policy Advisory Committee at the Office of the US Trade Representative.  Mr. Trump stated  “Paul is a great asset and an important addition as we consolidate the tremendous support we have received in the primaries and caucuses  garnering millions more votes than any other candidate. Paul Manafort  and the team I am building  bring the needed skill sets to ensure that the will of the Republican voters  not the Washington political establishment  determines who will be the nominee for the Republican Party. I look forward to winning the nomination  and ultimately the presidency in order to Make America Great Again."  On his appointment Mr. Manafort said  “I am honored to serve Mr. Trump’s campaign  and look forward to helping secure his nomination as the Republican nominee for President. Mr. Trump has tapped into the growing disillusionment with the Washington political establishment. What he has achieved so far is historic. My role is to work with the professionals that Mr. Trump has assembled to protect the victories that he has won in states across the country. I am confident that he will be the Republican nominee and the next President of the United States.”  In addition  Mr. Trump is announcing that his campaign is opening a Washington  DC based office to coordinate his campaign’s work with the Republican National Committee  Congress  and his convention and delegate operations. The office will serve as a conduit for outreach for Mr. Trump’s campaign organization nationally.

The list of potential Supreme Court nominees he released after our first meeting was very encouraging.   But the House policy agenda has been the main focus of our dialogue. We’ve talked about the common ground this agenda can represent. We’ve discussed how the House can be a driver of policy ideas. We’ve talked about how important these reforms are to saving our country. And we’ve talked about how  by focusing on issues that unite Republicans  we can work together to heal the fissures developed through the primary.   Through these conversations  I feel confident he would help us turn the ideas in this agenda into laws to help improve people’s lives. That’s why I’ll be voting for him this fall.   It’s no secret that he and I have our differences. I won’t pretend otherwise. And when I feel the need to  I’ll continue to speak my mind. But the reality is  on the issues that make up our agenda  we have more common ground than disagreement.   For me  it’s a question of how to move ahead on the ideas that I—and my House colleagues—have invested so much in through the years. It’s not just of choice of two people  but of two visions for America. And House Republicans are helping to shape that Republican vision by offering a bold policy agenda  by offering a better way ahead. Donald Trump can help us make it a reality.

It's a farce that "no one is above the law" and my heart goes out to all who've been unjustly accused and destroyed over much lesser crimes than Hillary's.   We MUST redouble efforts to restore the rule of law that had sustained the most exceptional nation on earth  with everyone doing their part:  * Don't put blind faith in any politician  but don't give up on our forefathers' charters of freedom that created a Republic to be governed by and for We the People. * Teach your children America's foundation built on the rule of law; ensure they understand consequences for their actions  despite our temporary leaders facing no such thing.  * Unite behind those who have no part in the corrupt political machine that would mock  silence and destroy the outsiders committed to serving for the right reasons; oppose all who campaign one way but govern another once they get to Washington and get sucked in to both party establishments that reward and protect their own.  * Get your boots on the ground and work for what you know is right for our country's survival. Don't just preach to the choir - infiltrate and influence outside your comfort zone to empower others to take a stand against the Left's devastating fundamental transformation of America.   Letting Hillary skate today is no surprise when the team she's on has celebrated its administrators pleading the fifth  over and over again  sending messages to America that they're all above the law. From the IRS's Lois Lerner to Hillary herself testifying in front of Congress  they've all told Congress to kiss off  and Congress kissed off.    Today's FBI forgiveness of tyrants' illegal acts illustrate  purpose in why I insist Americans rise up and tear down this tyrannical system that is destroying America from within. Truly  you're either with us or you're against us.   Message to all the "Republican" elites throwing in for Hillary  boasting they'll stay home instead of vote because their particular weakened good ol' boy is not the GOP nominee (the R.A.T.s suffering chappedass because their power and purse are threatened by the grassroots movement to destroy their failed politics-as-usual)  Hillary thanks you. She knows she can't win without you.   - Sarah Palin   http://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/judicial-watch-statement-decision-fbi-director-james-comey-not-recommend-indictment-hillary-clinton/  *images courtesy of Conservative TreeHouse and various anonymous internet postings

Disagreements on the 2nd Amendment were pretty fierce (I'm a fan  not a dimwit opponent of that most important right); as were par-for-the-course false suggestions of racism. Liberals didn't change my mind one iota  and I'm sure they weren't swayed by me  but our civil discourse reflected the general passion both sides feel as we vet our next President. I respect Carville's politically encyclopedic mind. (Though I insist he's dead wrong on who's fit to serve as America's next Commander in Chief.)

DONALD TRUMP: We will build a big wall to keep illegal chickens from crossing the road. We will have a door for legal chickens.   JOHN KERRY: We will trust the chicken to tell us whether it crossed the road or not.   CHRIS CHRISTIE: We need to waterboard that chicken to find out why it crossed the road.   RAND PAUL: It's none of our business why the chicken crossed the road.   NANCY PELOSI: We will have to wait until the chicken crosses the road to see what it says.   CARLY FIORINA: Hillary Clinton lied about why the chicken crossed the road.   BRIAN WILLIAMS: I crossed the road with the chicken   BEN CARSON: This isn't brain surgery... It wanted grain.   SARAH PALIN: The chicken crossed the road because  gosh-darn it  he's a maverick!   BARACK OBAMA: Let me be perfectly clear  if the chickens like their eggs they can keep their eggs. No chicken will be required to cross the road to surrender her eggs. Period.   HILLARY CLINTON: What difference does it make why the chicken crossed the road?   GEORGE W. BUSH: We don't really care why the chicken crossed the road. We just want to know if the chicken is on our side of the road or not. The chicken is either with us or against us. There is no middle ground here.   BILL CLINTON: I did not cross the road with that chicken.   BERNIE SANDERS: That little chicken will pay 80% income taxes no matter what side of the road it's on. He's got to help finance free college even for those that just want a four year vacation.   AL GORE: I invented the chicken.   AL SHARPTON: Why are all the chickens white?

In the 1960s  polar bear numbers were down  but then stabilized  and now in fact the population enjoys great healthy growth! It's time to retire the polar bear as a global warming mascot.   On Monday May 2nd head to theatres to see "Climate Hustle" - a historic one-night movie event that will open America's eyes to the truth behind the global warming "consensus." Click http://www.climatehustlemovie.com/ to find theaters and preorder tickets. It's time to expose the climate hustle once and for all.   "Anthropomorphism" is attributing human traits to objects and animals. Polar bears are majestic creatures  but there is nothing gentle & cuddly about them. They're created to be predators. Ferociously so. Just ask our cute  cuddly seal pups if "anthropomorphism" is your thing.     On Monday  May 2nd  join me in cinemas nationwide for a special one-night presentation of the groundbreaking film “Climate Hustle.” This informative (and even humorous!) film tears the cover off global warming hype  reveals the science that Al Gore and the UN don't want you to see  and profiles renowned scientists who have re-examined evidence and become cautious - even skeptical - of climate alarmism. Following the feature  audiences will be treated to an exclusive panel discussion moderated by Brent Bozell of the Media Research Center  where I'm joined by respected climatologist Dr. David Legates  Marc Moreno  and a video appearance by Bill Nye the so-called "Science Guy.”  Don't miss this special theatrical event on May 2nd.  Visit www.ClimateHustle.com for information about tickets and locations.  The people using the polar bear species to hustle us are the same bunch who want to stymie America's pursuit of responsible natural resource development.  Ready to trust real science? Ready to put an end to the climate hustle? Watch the movie May 2nd to help accomplish that. Thank you!

No  despite reports  I didn't "drop out" of anything in Wyoming's GOP Primary today. I wasn't scheduled to be there  which can be verified by the Trump Campaign and our email exchanges from EIGHT DAYS AGO where it was agreed a trip to Wyoming wouldn't fit in with my prior obligations to work in DC and Nevada this weekend.

I've never had a PR team to correct the record for me  so within reason I try to keep up with constant misreporting... but it's impossible to do when I "have a life" and don't waste precious time perusing press clippings. So please  just continue to doubt anything and everything the media reports. They've created dangerous times for this nation when they're impossible to trust.

It is being used by Big Government cheerleaders to have more control over us  our homes  our businesses  our families  and our lives. Head to the theater May 2nd to see "Climate Hustle." Here's a theater near you for this one night event: www.ClimateHustle.com   Here in DC I've participated in a special Capitol Hill screening of this great new film - "Climate Hustle" - that debunks all the alarmism and hyped-up Hollywood doomsaying about global warming. We had an enlightened  informative panel discussion about how America desperately deserves to hear real science and real facts currently ignored on this issue of changes in the weather.    Climate alarmists say the "science is settled" and the "debate is over" on climate but anyone who sees this movie will know differently. It's especially important with the Obama Administration soon signing America on to the dangerous Paris Climate Agreement  which ultimately leads to more unnecessary government control over every aspect of our lives.   "Climate Hustle" is nationwide only on May 2nd.  Visit www.ClimateHustle.com for info.  https://www.dropbox.com/s/599h9x5reufs1nt/SidebarCHMoreimages_FINAL.png?dl=0

Your gracious allowance of my sharing pro-Donald J. Trump points is appreciated.   The comparison of Trump's trade policies with President Reagan placing smart tariffs on specific foreign imports proved the fairness to American workers that Reagan insisted on  and in doing so he saved Wisconsin industry.   And I just HAD to add General George Patton's observation.  While leading the Greatest Generation  Patton declared  "Politicians are the lowest form of life on earth. Liberal Democrats are the lowest form of politicians!"  Had to add it as a reminder of what we're ultimately up against and what it will take to save our nation. It'll be God's grace - and UNITY among patriots like those at Serb Hall tonight who love this country as much as we love our own families.   So let's engage in vigorous  healthy competition; then vote; then UNITE to make America great again!   (And Wisconsin  don't forget my proposed "Unity Pledge" for your heroic #64 Jerry Kramer.

Wisconsin's middle class has been hurt by DC politicians' out-of-touch policies worse than any other state - 100 000 jobs lost to Mexico and China thanks to trade deficits with countries that cheat on our "agreements."   Donald J. Trump has fought for American workers and against trade deficits for decades in the private sector  unlike his competitors who actually support Obama's reckless TPP and TPA deals that are entirely unfair to the U.S. worker! As President he'll bring manufacturing jobs back home; his interests are OUR interests  and his trade policies will finally put America first.

See this candid interaction in Wisconsin yesterday: http://nation.foxnews.com/2016/03/29/you-saved-me-trumps-emotional-moment-fmr-miss-wisconsin-who-has-terminal-illness-video  The beauty of Trump's frontrunner campaign  besides exposing politicians' undeniable allegiance to special interest donors instead of voters  is the rise of the worthy "outsider" candidate who genuinely cares... never has to fake it... never needs to contort persona or responses according to the audience... refreshingly speaks and acts as the antithesis between We the People and today's typical politician... and is running for the most selfless reasons.   Trump's undervalued interpersonal touch is appreciated by we who understand the status quo political establishment that thrives in their beltway bubble will continue to disappoint Americans. We'll continue to be ignored when we demand a balanced budget  a prioritized military  secure borders  trade that creates U.S. jobs  and an end to crony capitalism in OUR government. We've provided today's politicians EVERY OPPORTUNITY to tackle each of those issues  and even wielding all the power in the majority  they've blown it. It's time for something different - and better - in order to enjoy a different - and better - result.   America  it's time for something better - in order to survive.   - Sarah Palin

These grotesque animals are unfit for life in any civilization. In reading a news update from Pastor Kim Clement  it sounds like innocent Americans and Israelis were also slaughtered in the name of a twisted  demonic-inspired death cult. But with deep faith  Kim goes on to assure us  "Those who are with us are far greater than those who are against us." Kim calls for unity in prayer and aggressive opposition to any complacency in strategizing against ISIS.   Another pastor has encouraging words today in this op-ed. Please  please take the time to read it. Consider that America is in the midst of an eye-opening  unconventional Presidential election that is confusing some  but is necessarily shifting and sifting people and situations away from political and media deception so voters may see clearly what is at stake.    I read it with a confirming unction that we're right in choosing what I call the Golden Wrecking Ball.  It's an interesting take by a Christian pastor regarding Donald Trump's winning ways. Our candidate IS the wrecking ball needed in Washington because America has the most amazing  secure  prosperous future once corruption  apathy  and the "fundamental transformation of America" are finally stopped by a leader who wants us to make America great again. Trump knows it's now or never  and we've no time for politics as usual.   Trump knows that millions of people want to kill America  "...they're armed to the teeth and are getting more sophisticated and deadly every day " you'll read in Pastor Rick Joyner's piece.  Patriots  we deserve better than crony capitalists (every one of the "ambitious" ones who've participated in causing the governmental problems they all of a sudden  insultingly  claim they'll fix!) in office today who have had every opportunity - but still refuse - to   *protect our borders    *prioritize budgets to rebuild our military    *quit raising the debt ceiling   *demand free and fair trade deals putting American jobs first instead of fast tracking Obama's blundered deals    *commit to appointing Constitutionalists to the bench  and  *get government off our back.   I differ with Pastor Joyner's assessment of the VP slot because I'm a "The-Status-Quo-Has-Got-To-Go"- kinda' commonsense conservative  and we need Senators to FIGHT for us from their present Senate seats... but tell me what you think!   https://www.morningstarministries.org/resources/prophetic-bulletins/2016/trump-one?utm_source=Word+for+the+Week&utm_campaign=fc3d79a7f0-Is_Trump_the_One_Corrected_Prophetic_Bul3_22_2016&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_dbe2b6f05d-fc3d79a7f0-244341481&mc_cid=fc3d79a7f0&mc_eid=f3e124adc3#.VvFnPVU76nM

We're blacklisted! Patriots who've had enough of Washington DC hypocrisy and t'aint gonna take it anymore are now officially "blacklisted" and "targeted" (*note: you are not allowed to use those politically incorrect words  you racist gun clingers; only the chosen ones are allowed).   The so-called "conservative" Professional Political Class has united against me and others for supporting our party's frontrunner and refusing to join their #NeverTrump campaign that will ultimately elect Hillary Clinton. The self-appointed kingmakers don't even hide the fact their efforts to destroy our winning candidate  while disrespecting the will of the people  ultimately bolsters the liberal left and fuels the insider's shared gravy train that they all suck from. Many have actually promised to stop at nothing to thwart the electorate's choice for a successful commonsense conservative who's in perfect position to bust up the Washington cabal and return our government back to We the People.  Want to join me on their blacklist? Sign here! Want a bumpersticker proclaiming it loud and proud? Make one  then send me one for my truck  eh?  In setting aside "real life" this morning  I took a minute to google news of the day and saw this blacklist. It immediately reminded me why millions of Americans across party lines are coalescing to reject Washington DC's politics-as-usual.   The political establishment collecting names to brand us blacklisted are exactly this - as spoken by William F. Buckley: "Liberals claim to want to give a hearing to other views  but then are shocked and offended to discover that there are other views." Obviously the same is true with our own party's elitist political bullies who claim to be the only keepers of the conservative flame ignited by Buckley  Goldwater and Reagan.   This Primary election has sifted out the self-appointed movers and shakers in the GOP who are up to no good  thanks to Donald Trump's campaign exposing unprincipled politicos' true agenda. For as much as these politicians  pundits  consultants  and "conservative" media types rant  rave and pontificate  there's no denying they really don't care who wins elections as long as they keep their perks  titles  ratings  and invites to their pal's preachin'-to-the-choir venues.   More Americans now find out these folks are really good at using and abusing their audiences and supporters. I know personally that when it benefited their elections  their fundraisers  their poll numbers  careers and connections  they sure agreed with my conservative politics. For nearly a decade they've requested my endorsement  my social media shout-outs  my pro bono consulting and advice  and as much in-person support as my time allowed me to give them. They were either lying then  or they're lying now about my judgment creds. I've never asked any of them for anything in return (they can all testify to that) except their integrity to shine. You'd think that at least in my respecting their right to endorse whichever Presidential candidate they choose  they'd reciprocate and simply respect my right to endorse a commonsense conservative Republican who just happens to not be top of their list.   ... Here are some old friends who now relegate others and me to their blacklist:  -             a “conservative commentator” who thought I was a “really terrific lady” when we jointly supported gubernatorial candidates... not so much anymore. http://www.redstate.com/erick/2010/05/15/on-the-road-with-nikki-haley-sarah-palin/  -             the leader of a DC pro-life advocacy group who has raised money with my name  likeness and personal efforts for years – so far as having my portrait in their lobby - now condemns me for supporting a candidate who saw the light and passionately joined our fight  for LIFE years ago and has campaigned to shut down government in order to defund Planned Parenthood. This  despite the fact the condemning group’s President and CEO was once a pro-choice activist herself. http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/13/AR2010051305127.html  -            Rallying a group of young conservative DC staffers when I travelled across the country to support their bosses' efforts to defund Obamacare. Since I'm supporting a Republican candidate promising to do away with Obamacare  some of these same staffers are now hell-bent on blacklisting me  and have even gone so far as accusing me of “trashing the constitution” and lying - accusing me of being paid  for my endorsements! They know better but spew the lies anyway. Some of these young folks started out bright and talented  but they're corrupted by power in Washington. Still  I’ll hold out hope for them and echo the words of Mr. Buckley once again: “I won't insult your intelligence by suggesting that you really believe what you just said.” (Oh – and to one of those staffers-turned-talking-head  Amanda  who now helps lead this charge against me  Dr. Ben Carson  Gov. Rick Scott  Gov. Jan Brewer  Phyllis Schlafly  Sen. Jeff Sessions  Matt Drudge  Ted Nugent  Jerry Falwell  Jr.  Willie Robertson  and other red-blooded hard-core Conservatives  I meant what I said when you brought your kids all the way to meet me that day not long ago - they really are cute.)   So the clever DC herd that's created the cutesie social media hashtag (because Twitter handles are just so doggone intimidating and powerful in battle  I guess?) are attempting to thwart the will of the people and the power of electorate with their #NeverTrump ammo. Well  kiddos  quick history lesson – our founders had their own hard copy kind of hashtag. It looked like #WeThePeople. And #WeThePeople are turning out by the millions  smashing voter participation records to fight against exactly the sort of hypocritical elitist games you are playing with our Republic. #WeThePeople will be in Cleveland this summer for the GOP Convention to make sure your haughtiness doesn't drive you to follow through on your asinine threats to do something untoward and silence the voice of #WeThePeople. True Conservatives and Independents who are in this for a reason  not a season... who don't look at elections as "just business"... who sacrifice precious time and resources away from our families and jobs in order to help others  well  we'll continue to stand united against the Left with our nominee  despite your ironclad commitment now to see him fall  which leads to Hillary's victory.   In all graciousness  you're invited to take the DC bubble blinders off and see that in order to form a more perfect Union and save our country #WeThePeople have needed another revolution. You're encouraged to drop out of that professional political class and rise up on the right side with us. All it takes is finally recognizing that in the needed revolution  we've found a revolutionary.   If nothing else  remember the words of the prophetic Andrew Breitbart as I shout a hearty "AMEN" and encourage others to join me on the blacklist  for it is a badge of honor:   “I don’t care who our candidate is and I haven’t since the beginning of this. I haven’t! Ask not what the candidate can do for you  ask what you can do for the candidate! … When I walk through CPAC or I travel the United States to meet people in the Tea Party who care – black  white  gay  and straight – anyone that’s willing to stand next to me to fight the progressive left  I will be in that bunker. And if you’re not in that bunker because you’re not satisfied with a certain candidate  more than shame on you! You’re on the other side!” – Andrew Breitbart  CPAC 2012  "Blacklist" info here - http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/03/18/gop-smart-set-plots-blacklist-of-trump-supporters/  Listen to Andrew Breitbart's call for unity  in his own words: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tq2rXSVF4rk

The arrogance of career politicians is something at which the rest of us chuckle  but Cruz's latest dig strays from humorous into downright nasty. Cruz is right  though - independent  America-first  commonsense conservatives supporting Donald Trump ARE "low information" when it comes to having any information on Cruz's ability to expand the conservative movement  beat Hillary Clinton  unify and lead the nation.  * Where's information on any Cruz success whilst in his short  half-term U.S. Senate seat  proving his resume's advantage over another career politicians's lawyerly executive inexperience that includes never having created a single private sector job  but boasting of his constitutional law teacher creds? (Remember America experimented with that resume before; how'd that work out for the country?)   * Where's info on his reasoning in inviting more illegal aliens to flood our porous borders by enticing families with benefits and literal gifts (like teddy bears and soccer balls)? http://theconservativetreehouse.com/2016/01/17/ted-cruz-visits-texas-border-to-welcome-illegal-alien-families/  * Any info on why he won't denounce his highest-profile campaign buddy  despite Glenn Beck's proclamation that he "hates" America's innocent victims of 9/11 and calls the families crybabies? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hf33g9ep4YU  nor hold accountable his campaign manager for abhorrent tactics that mirror Alinsky's Politics of Personal Destruction? http://www.mediaite.com/online/ted-cruz-adviser-admits-to-making-ad-that-allegedly-drove-missouri-pol-to-suicide/  * Info on why he continues to stand on stage with that most prominent supporter who slurs millions of patriotic Americans supporting the GOP frontrunner  calling them Nazi "brown shirts"? http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/02/glenn-beck-loses-fans-and-respect-after-repeatedly-comparing-trump-supporters-to-nazi-brownshirts/  * Info on consistency with his big endorsement this week  as Carly tells it like it is so very recently?  "Ted Cruz is just like any other politician. He says one thing in Manhattan  he says another thing in Iowa. He says whatever he needs to say to get elected  and then he's going to do as he pleases. I think people are tired of a political class that promises much and delivers much of the same." - Carly Fiorina 1/2/16  * Info on his support for his crony capitalists' insistence that he fast-track Obama's unbalanced trade agenda  then lied about it? http://theconservativetreehouse.com/2015/12/11/yes-unfortunately-ted-cruz-did-support-trans-pacific-trade-deal-tpa-with-video/  * Info on why he's fine with increasing U.S. debt? http://truthinmedia.com/cruz-rubio-vote-increase-debt-ceiling-paul-votes-no/  * Info on how it helps make America great again by arrogantly disenfranchising this Primary season's majority voters who are fed-up  inspired  optimistic  and engaged? How does it help unify the party or the nation when that holier-than-thou narcissism manifests itself through negative  biting  deceptive tactics... when he's had so many opportunities to disavow his campaign's shenanigans and apologize for his own?   The information we've sought is nonexistent  thus "low information voters" comprising the GOP majority support Cruz staying in the Legislative branch  while hopefully gaining understanding of the private sector's need to reduce the big government he's a big part of.  Trump's energized  positive campaign has led to this record setting stat: of all 24 states that have voted so far  ALL smashed previous GOP turnout records! 4 347 317 votes nationwide for Trump already. Now THAT'S "enlarging the tent." Any info  Ted  on where you think that "disengaged" momentum will take us?

In America today  being poor not only means you are less likely to have a grocery store in your community selling healthy food  far too often it means you don't know where your next meal is going to come from. In fact  15 million children in America today are living in families that struggle to put enough food on the table.  Being poor means you are less likely to have access to a doctor  a dentist  or a mental health care provider. And if you are lucky enough to see a doctor being poor means you are less likely to afford the prescription drugs a doctor prescribes to you.  In fact  one out of five Americans between the ages of 18-64 cannot afford the medication they are prescribed.

I oppose the painful and inhumane business of locking up and deporting families who have fled horrendous violence in Central America and other countries. Sending these people back into harm’s way is wrong.  I urge President Obama to use his executive authority to protect families by extending Temporary Protective Status for those who fled from Central America.

Living in poverty doesn’t just mean you don’t have enough money to buy a big screen TV  a fancy laptop computer  or the latest version of the iPhone. It goes much deeper than that.   Living in poverty means you might not know where your next meal is going to come from.   Living in poverty means you are less likely to have access to a doctor  a dentist  or a mental health care provider.    Living in poverty means you are less likely to have access to public transportation — which makes it harder to find a job.   If you add all of these things up  what you will find is that yes  far too often  poverty is a death sentence in America. It is unacceptable  and we must address this issue with urgency.

When my Republican colleagues use the term they’re usually talking about things like opposition to contraception  denying a woman’s right to choose  opposition to gay rights  and support for abstinence-only education.  Family values: let’s talk about what those words mean.  When a mother can’t spend time with her newborn child during the first weeks and months of life  that is not a family value.  When a husband can’t get time off from work to care for his cancer-stricken wife  that is not a family value.  When a mother is forced to send her sick child to school because she can’t afford to stay home  that is not a family value.  When parents and children can’t spend any time on vacation together during the course of an entire year  that is not a family value.

Getting rid of regulations that protect workers and the environment may be good for corporate profits  but it would be a disaster for the American people. A trade agreement with Europe could give us an historic opportunity to improve the rights of workers  the environment  and consumer protections. Unfortunately  today's leaks show that this trade deal would do the exact opposite by continuing the race to the bottom. As president  Sen. Sanders will not agree to any trade deal that deregulates Wall Street  undermines American laws  increases the price of prescription drugs  threatens food safety and allows foreign corporations to challenge laws that would reduce their expected future profits before an international tribunal. Trade is a good thing  but it has got to be fair.

This is a company that in 2014 provided its retired CEO  Louis Schenevert  with a golden parachute of $172 million – including a pension worth $31 million. And they apparently got rid of him because he was doing a bad job! Imagine what they would have given him if he was doing a good job.  This is a company that could afford to pay its new CEO more than $14 million in total compensation last year.  This is a company which made a profit of more than $7 billion last year.  This is a company that received $6 billion in defense contracts last year from the taxpayers of this country.  This is a company that in 2009 received $121 million in federal tax credits designed specifically to keep green manufacturing jobs in the United States.  And this is a company that has received more than $58 million in corporate welfare from the Export-Import Bank. That is unacceptable.  The greed of United Technologies is almost unbelievable. You can’t make this stuff up. They have no shame.  Today  we need to send a very loud and very clear message to the CEO of United Technologies: Stop the greed. Stop destroying the middle class in America. Respect your workers. Respect the American people.

Clinton have very different points of view on how to reform Wall Street and the largest financial institutions in this country.  Bernie believes it's necessary to break up large financial institutions not only because we need to prevent another Wall Street bailout  but because of the incredible concentration of ownership and power that now rest with a handful of these huge institutions.   Within the first 100 days of his administration  Bernie will require the secretary of the Treasury Department to establish a “Too-Big-to Fail” list of commercial banks  shadow banks and insurance companies whose failure would pose a catastrophic risk to the United States economy without a taxpayer bailout.  Within a year  the Sanders administration will work with the Federal Reserve and financial regulators to break these institutions up using the authority of Section 121 of the Dodd-Frank Act.  Bernie will also fight to enact a 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act to clearly separate commercial banking  investment banking and insurance services. Sec. Clinton opposes this extremely important measure.  President Franklin Roosevelt signed the Glass-Steagall Act into law precisely to prevent Wall Street speculators from causing another Great Depression. And  it worked for more than five decades until Wall Street watered it down under President Reagan and killed it under President Clinton. That is unacceptable and that is why Bernie will fight to sign the Warren-McCain bill into law.

The Panama Free Trade Agreement put a stamp of approval on Panama  a world leader when it comes to allowing the wealthy and the powerful to avoid taxes. I was opposed to the Panama Free Trade Agreement from day one. I predicted that the passage of this disastrous trade deal would make it easier  not harder  for the wealthy and large corporations to evade taxes by sheltering billions of dollars offshore. I wish I had been proven wrong about this  but it has now come to light that the extent of Panama’s tax avoidance scams is even worse than I had feared.  My opponent  on the other hand  opposed this trade agreement when she was running against Barack Obama for president in 2008. But when it really mattered she quickly reversed course and helped push the Panama Free Trade Agreement through Congress as Secretary of State. The results have been a disaster.  The American people are sick and tired of establishment politicians who say one thing during a campaign and do the exact opposite the day after the election.  It is time for real change. As president  I will use my authority to terminate the Panama Free Trade Agreement within six months. My administration will conduct an immediate investigation into U.S. banks  corporations and wealthy individuals who have been stashing their cash in Panama to avoid taxes. If any of them have violated U.S. law  my administration will prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law.

Check out the Panama Papers released by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. They show that over 214 000 offshore companies are using tax havens in Panama to evade taxes. This includes 500 banks which have registered over 15 000 shell companies in Panama. That is unacceptable and that has got to change.  Sadly  Secretary Clinton made this tax evasion worse by supporting the Panama Free Trade Agreement in 2011  even though she opposed it when she was running for President against Barack Obama in 2008.    Bernie  on the other hand  opposed this disastrous trade deal from day one. During the debate over the Panama trade deal in 2011  Senator Sanders said on the floor of the Senate: "Panama is a world leader when it comes to allowing wealthy Americans and large corporations to evade U.S. taxes by stashing their cash in offshore tax havens. And the Panama Free Trade Agreement would make this bad situation much worse ... The trade agreement with Panama would effectively bar the United States from cracking down on illegal and abusive offshore tax havens in Panama. In fact  combating tax haven abuse in Panama would be a violation of this free-trade agreement  exposing the United States to fines from international authorities."  As president  Bernie will re-negotiate this trade deal to make sure that the wealthy and powerful cannot avoid paying their fair share of taxes by stashing their cash in Panama.

She supported those bad deals. I opposed them.  Now she says she wants to make it tougher for automobiles to be imported to this country under the disastrous Trans-Pacific Partnership. That’s the deal she called the ‘gold standard’ when she was Secretary of State.  Well  I have a message for Secretary Clinton: We shouldn’t re-negotiate the Pacific trade proposal. We should kill this unfettered free-trade agreement which would cost us nearly half a million jobs.  We don’t need to tinker with this agreement. We need to defeat it. We need an entirely new trade policy that creates jobs in this country  not more low-wage jobs abroad.  Secretary Clinton could have stopped a trade deal that threatens hundreds of thousands of jobs last year when it was being debated in Congress. Instead  she chose to remain silent and forced working families  unions and members of Congress to fight against the world’s biggest corporations and the most powerful special interests in the country without her support.  The people of Ohio don’t need a president who says the right things in a stump speech. They need a president who is with them every single day.

From Staten Island to Baltimore  Ferguson to Baton Rouge  too many African American families mourn the loss of a loved one from a police-involved incident. Something is profoundly wrong when so many Americans have reason to believe that our country doesn’t consider them as precious as others because of the color of their skin.  I am glad the Department of Justice has agreed to a full and thorough review of this shooting. Incidents like this one have undermined the trust between police departments and the communities they serve. We need to rebuild that trust. We need to ensure justice is served. That begins with common sense reforms like ending racial profiling  providing better training on de-escalation and implicit bias  and supporting municipalities that refer the investigation and prosecution of police-involved deaths to independent bodies. All over America  there are police officers demonstrating how to protect the public without resorting to unnecessary force. We need to learn from and build on those examples.  Progress is possible if we stand together and never waver in our fight to secure the future that every American deserves.

Already  stories of heroism on the part of Turkish police are emerging  as their quick actions to confront the suspects may have prevented an even worse tragedy. Today’s attack in Istanbul only strengthens our resolve to defeat the forces of terrorism and radical jihadism around the world. And it reminds us that the United States cannot retreat. We must deepen our cooperation with our allies and partners in the Middle East and Europe to take on this threat. Such cooperation is essential to protecting the homeland and keeping our country safe. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims  their families  and the Turkish people.

By overturning restrictions that made it nearly impossible for Texans to exercise their full reproductive rights  the Court has rightfully upheld every woman’s fundamental right to safe  legal abortion  no matter where she lives.  To everyone who flooded the Texas Capitol to speak out against these attacks on women’s health  to the brave women and men across the country who shared their stories  and to the health care providers who fought for their patients and refused to give up: this victory belongs to you. I applaud you  and I thank you.  But our fight is far from over. In Texas  throughout the South  and across the country  a woman’s constitutional right to make her own health decisions is under attack. In the first three months of 2016  states introduced more than 400 measures restricting access to abortion. We’ve seen a concerted  persistent attack on women’s health and rights at the federal level. Meanwhile  Donald Trump has said women should be punished for having abortions—as if women  particularly low-income women and women of color  didn’t already face enough barriers to exercising their basic rights. He also pledged to defund Planned Parenthood and appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade.  Today’s decision is a reminder of how much is at stake in this election. We need a president who will not only defend women’s health and rights—including appointing Supreme Court justices who recognize Roe v. Wade as settled law—but expand them  by overturning the Hyde Amendment  protecting funding for Planned Parenthood  and building on the Affordable Care Act and its benefits for women’s health. Above all  today and every day  we need to continue to protect access to safe and legal abortion—not just on paper  but in reality.

Having a student body with diverse experiences and perspectives breaks down barriers  enriches academia  and prepares our young people to be leaders and citizens in our increasingly diverse country. We need to guarantee that the doors to higher education are open not just to some  but to all—and that we are giving students equal opportunities to succeed and thrive. Today’s Supreme Court decision affirms a basic truth about our country: we are stronger together.

Because the Supreme Court was unable to reach a decision  5 million families will continue to live under the specter of deportation. These are our friends and family members; neighbors and classmates; DREAMers and parents of Americans and lawful permanent residents. They enrich our communities and contribute to our economy every day. I believe that President Obama acted well within his authority in issuing these actions—and as president  I will defend DAPA and DACA  do everything possible under the law to keep families together  and introduce comprehensive immigration reform with a path to full and equal citizenship within my first 100 days.   The ruling also underscores just how high the stakes are in this election. Republicans’ adamant refusal to even consider the president's nominee for the current vacancy on the Supreme Court is hurting our country. They need to stop playing political games with our democracy and give Judge Merrick Garland a fair hearing and vote. It's also a striking reminder of how dangerous a Donald Trump presidency would be: Trump would fully repeal President Obama's executive actions and create a deportation force to round up 11 million undocumented immigrants. He has called Mexican immigrants "rapists" and "murderers." We can't allow someone who engages in bigotry like this to become president.  I believe we're stronger together—when we embrace immigrants  not demean them. When we build bridges  not walls.

And how did Donald Trump respond? He congratulated himself for "being right" about terrorism. He implied President Obama secretly sympathizes with terrorists. He gave a "national security speech" where he doubled down on his proposal to ban on Muslims immigrating into the country. He attempted to use LGBT rights (he doesn't support them) to justify more hateful rhetoric against an entire religious group that has nothing to do with terrorism. And he banned Washington Post reporters from covering public events on his campaign—because he doesn't like what they write about him.        Since Donald secured the nomination  we've been left to imagine what President Trump would do in the aftermath of a disaster. Now we know: He'll aggrandize himself. He'll sow division  play on fear  and spur more hate and violence. He'll embarrass us on the world stage  and maybe do much worse.      We can't let him get anywhere near the Oval Office.

And one of the ways we have to respond is by acting to stop terrorists from getting the tools they need to carry out attacks—especially assault weapons like those used in Orlando  San Bernardino  and Sandy Hook. We may have our disagreements on gun safety regulations  but we should all be able to agree on a few things. For one  if the FBI is watching you for suspected terrorist links  you shouldn’t be able to just go buy a gun with no questions asked.  Some will say that assault weapons and background checks have nothing to do with terrorism. Well  in Orlando and San Bernardino  terrorists used assault weapons like the AR-15 to kill Americans. We should make it harder for them to do so. That might not stop every shooting or terrorist attack—but it will stop some. It will save lives. And I’m not going to stop fighting for it.

It’s the letter that President Bush left in the Oval Office for my husband  back in January of 1993. They had just fought a fierce campaign. Bill won  President Bush lost. In a democracy  that’s how it goes.    But when Bill walked into that office for the very first time as President  that note was waiting for him. It had some good advice about staying focused on what mattered  despite the critics. It wished him happiness. And it concluded with these words:   “You will be our President when you read this note. I wish you well. I wish your family well. Your success is now our country’s success. And I am rooting hard for you. George.”   That’s the America we love. That is what we cherish and expect.

No matter how many times we endure attacks like this  the horror never fades. The murder of innocent people always breaks our hearts  tears at our sense of security  and makes us furious. So many of us are praying for everyone who was killed  for the wounded and those still missing  and for all the loved ones grieving today. As a mother  I can’t imagine what those families are going through.   But we owe their memories and their families more than prayer. We must also take decisive action to strengthen our international alliances and combat acts of terror  to keep weapons of war off our streets  and to affirm the rights of LGBT Americans—and all Americans—to feel welcome and safe in our country.  Here’s what we absolutely cannot do: We cannot demonize Muslim people. Inflammatory anti-Muslim rhetoric hurts the vast majority of Muslims who love freedom and hate terror. It’s no coincidence that hate crimes against American Muslims and mosques tripled after Paris and San Bernardino. Islamophobia goes against everything we stand for as a nation founded on freedom of religion  and it plays right into the terrorists’ hands.  We’re a big-hearted  fair-minded country. We teach our children that this is one nation under God  indivisible  with liberty and justice for all—not just for people who look a certain way  or love a certain way  or worship a certain way.  I want to say this to all the LGBT people grieving today in Florida and across our country: You have millions of allies who will always have your back. I am one of them. From Stonewall to Laramie and now Orlando  we’ve seen too many examples of how the struggle to live freely  openly  and without fear has been marked by violence. We have to stand together. Be proud together. There is no better rebuke to the terrorists and all those who hate.  This fundamentally American idea—that we’re stronger together—is why I’m so confident that we can overcome the threats we face  solve our challenges at home  and build a future where no one’s left out or left behind. We can do it  if we do it together.

Since that first day when we learned of the devastating disease that would come to be known as AIDS  we've lost millions of friends and loved ones—some of mine included.  35 years later  we've made tremendous strides in treating and preventing the spread of HIV and AIDS. Thanks to advocates and survivors who refused to accept silence and inaction  countless lives have been saved. I've made this my fight  too: from strategizing with world leaders about how to stop the spread of HIV and AIDS as First Lady  to launching an initiative as secretary of state to usher in an AIDS-free generation through prevention and treatment around the world—this is a battle I will continue to wage  alongside activists and survivors  until we win.  HIV and AIDS still disproportionately threaten communities of color  transgender people  young people  and gay and bisexual men  and millions still live with HIV in the U.S. and around the world. But we have the tools to end this epidemic once and for all  and the next president will play a pivotal role in helping to make an AIDS-free generation a reality. If we work with our partners around the world to invest in research  expand access to health care and education  and dismantle the stigma that hurts people and increases risk  this is a goal we can reach together. I'm determined to do it—we owe it to those we lost  and all future generations  to end the AIDS epidemic in America at last.

Judge Curiel is as much of an American as I am. He’s as much of an American as Donald Trump is.   Let's be clear about what Trump is saying. He thinks that because Judge Curiel's family has Mexican roots  he can’t do his job. Donald Trump isn't just wrong about this; his words show that he’s wrong about America. He’s wrong about what makes this country great. And on a day that we are mourning Muhammad Ali  let's remember that we live in a country where people can break down barriers  worship their own god  choose their own name  and lead and follow their dreams as far as their hard work and talent will take them.

Join me in supporting Tim Huelskamp for Congress today: http://www.huelskamp.org/  There’s something missing in Congress that Tim Huelskamp  who represents Kansas’s First Congressional District  demonstrates he has on a daily basis -- backbone. On all the issues that matter most to conservatives -- protecting innocent life  cutting out-of-control spending  and fighting to repeal Obamacare  just to name a few -- I have been able to count on Tim’s principled  conservative leadership.   During these uncertain times for our nation  it is more important than ever that conservatives stand together. Economic opportunity  our constitutional liberties  and indeed  the very fate of our nation all depend on having elected leaders who are not beholden to the establishment in Washington  but instead who work for We the People. That is exactly why I’m proud to support Tim Huelskamp for re-election in Kansas’s First Congressional District.   The Washington establishment has always had their own best interests in mind  not yours. Tim is a principled conservative who has stood up to the Washington Cartel and fought for Kansans since the day he first arrived in our nation’s capital. On August 2nd  we need you to stand with Tim.

What happened next was something that never should have occurred. Kate’s time with her family and  ultimately  her life were brought to an abrupt end.   On July 1  2015  Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez  a man who entered our country illegally five times and racked up multiple felonies  brutally killed Kate Steinle. And sadly now  an entire year later  the problem that prompted Kate’s tragic  untimely death still exists.   Sanctuary cities and the criminal aliens they harbor are a threat to the safety of the American people. And yet  San Francisco and jurisdictions around the country still shelter illegal aliens  actively thwarting enforcement of our nation’s immigration laws.    Let me be clear  defiance of our immigration laws is inexcusable. On Wednesday of next week  the Senate is scheduled to vote on "Kate’s Law " legislation I authored and named in honor of Kate Steinle. This legislation would deter dangerous illegal aliens from reentering the country after being deported by imposing a five-year minimum sentence for certain illegal reentry offenses.   Next week  Congress has an opportunity to take a stand for the American people  but today  we remember Kate.   My thoughts and prayers go out to the Steinle family.

From 9/11 to the Boston Marathon  from Fort Hood to Chattanooga  from San Bernardino to last night’s horrific attack in Orlando  radical Islamic terrorism has declared jihad on America. Early reports indicate the Orlando terrorist had pledged his allegiance to ISIS  and he had previously been investigated by the FBI. And yet  as with the prior attacks  we were not able to act to stop this act of vicious terrorism that has now murdered 50 and injured more than 50 others.   Our hearts go out to those killed and wounded last night. Our prayers are with their families  and with all their grieving loved ones.      It is a time for action. We need a Commander in Chief who will speak the truth  and who will unleash the full force and fury of the American military to utterly destroy ISIS and its affiliates. We need to pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act  so that known ISIS terrorists cannot use U.S. passports to return to America and wage jihad. We need a President who is serious – who will identify the enemy by name and do everything necessary to defeat it.   The next few days will be sadly predictable. Democrats will try to use this attack to change the subject. As a matter of rigid ideology  far too many Democrats – from Barack Obama to Hillary Clinton – will refuse to utter the words "radical Islamic terrorism." They will claim this attack  like they claimed every previous attack  was isolated and had nothing to do with the vicious Islamist theology that is daily waging war on us across the globe. And they will try to exploit this terror attack to undermine the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms of law-abiding Americans.   Enough is enough. What we need is for every American – Democrat and Republican – to come together  abandon political correctness  and unite in defeating radical Islamic terrorism.   ISIS doesn’t just target soldiers. They don’t just target Republicans. Or Jews. They also target Christians and fellow Muslims. They target each and every one of us. As we saw this morning  they target the gay and lesbian community. Their objective  which they broadcast worldwide  is to murder or forcibly convert every single American.   For all the Democrats who are loud champions of the gay and lesbian community whenever there is a culture battle waging  now is the opportunity to speak out against an ideology that calls for the murder of gays and lesbians. ISIS and the theocracy in Iran (supported with American taxpayer dollars) regularly murder homosexuals  throwing them from buildings and burying them under rocks. This is wrong  it is evil  and we must all stand against it. Every human being has a right to live according to his or her faith and conscience  and nobody has a right to murder someone who doesn’t share their faith or sexual orientation.  If you’re a Democratic politician and you really want to stand for LGBT  show real courage and stand up against the vicious ideology that has targeted our fellow Americans for murder.   Today  all of America stands in solidarity with the people of Orlando. All of us should lift them up in prayer  demand action  and if you have any information about the Orlando shooter or potential radical Islamic terror plots  please act to keep us safe by using the FBI tips website: https://tips.fbi.gov.

Tragically  yesterday provided us yet another solemn reminder of the ever-present dangers facing our all-volunteer armed forces. In three separate incidents  each military department was forced to respond to events that occurred here at home  and in two of those  the lives of Americans who took an oath of service to this nation were lost.   The United States Air Force Thunderbirds  the U.S. Navy Blue Angels  and the U.S. Army 1st Cavalry Division began yesterday conducting routine operations and training missions; they ended in sorrow. In Texas  five soldiers from Fort Hood have been declared dead  with another four soldiers missing when their truck overturned while crossing a flooded creek. Thankfully  USAF pilot Maj. Alex Turner was able to eject safely  but unfortunately his fellow Naval aviator was not.   The lives of their families and friends have been torn asunder  not by combat losses in faraway places  but in sudden and unexpected accidents that occurred in the homeland. Preparing for war  training for combat conditions is inherently dangerous  and yet brave men and women across this nation routinely volunteer to face those risks.   Please join Heidi and me in praying for those we lost yesterday  please pray for their families and the communities of Pensacola and Fort Hood  and lastly  please pray for the safety of those who protect us each and every day.

Trump has consistently financed the campaigns of some of the most liberal politicians in the country. California is perhaps one of the more egregious examples.

It is a betrayal to all that Republicans across California have worked for.

Mr. Trump owes a full and immediate accounting to members of the media and the American public. Mr. Trump must confirm or deny reports in the media that others in the Washington Cartel’s industry of foreign policy for personal gain were involved in the drafting of this address — indeed  were the principal authors. In addition to the authors of the speech  he must fully identify the role and involvement of Mr. Manafort who is widely recognized for his entanglements with corrupt foreign regimes and anti-Democratic rulers.  This speech is the most dramatic evidence thus far that Donald Trump fails the presidential test. With this address he is now the foreign policy candidate of the Washington lobbyists  even as he proclaims “America first ” he puts K Street lobbyists first. He is never going to fight the system  he is the system. He and Hillary Clinton are two sides of the same coin. She has made her millions from inside and Donald Trump has made his billions buying people like Hillary Clinton. Both are part of the culture of foreign policy for personal gain.

The Democrats have debated. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have showed the respect the voters are due by subjecting themselves to the scrutiny of the voters. Indeed  the Democrats are talking about scheduling a second debate  and yet Donald Trump continues to cower in Trump Tower  afraid to defend his positions.   The reason he’s been afraid to do so is he has no answer when he’s asked how to bring jobs back to America. He has no answer when he’s asked how to keep America safe from radical Islamic terrorism.   This is a serious time. The American people want and deserve a serious leader focused on jobs  freedom  and security. That’s exactly what I will be and what I will do as President.

Today  he joined them in calling for grown men to be allowed to use little girls’ public restrooms. As the dad of young daughters  I dread what this will mean for our daughters – and for our sisters and our wives. It is a reckless policy that will endanger our loved ones.  Yet Donald stands up for this irresponsible policy while at the same time caving in on defending individual freedoms and religious liberty. He has succumbed to the Left’s agenda  which is to force Americans to leave God out of public life while paying lip service to false tolerance.  This is not real tolerance. The Left wants to force its belief system onto Americans across the country and silence people of faith in the public square. Unsurprisingly  Donald Trump is all too eager to join them. This simply confirms that the same man who favored partial-birth abortion and still supports public funding for Planned Parenthood will sacrifice principle on the altar of political correctness. Trump will not defeat political correctness. Today he bowed to it.

The light of Christ brings hope to every corner of the world. This year Heidi and I pray that in the wake of the Brussels attack  as we mourn for the victims who lost their lives in the subway tunnels and airport corridors at the hands of baseless terrorists  we will remember that the light of truth is stronger than the darkness of terror.  I am reminded of Saint John Paul II’s first return to Poland as Pope. In 1979  upon his arrival  he kissed the tarmac. And the dust that had all but covered the churches ruptured as the bells rang out – one after another. Soon millions of people lined the streets. And when Saint John Paul II addressed the crowds before the tomb of the Unknown Soldier  he spoke these immortal words: ‘On how many battlefields has that solider given witness to the rights of man  indelibly inscribed in the inviolable rights of the people  by falling for "our freedom and yours!"  And he asked for the Lord’s blessing upon the land:  "Let your Spirit descend. And renew the face of the earth  the face of this land."  That is the redemption message. By His sacrifice we are made new. And as we remember the gift of salvation on Good Friday and Easter Sunday  let us be so bold to ask the same. We face a different enemy than in 1979 – but one with the same goal – to snuff out the light of freedom. But we also know that just like Communism in 1980 it can be defeated because good overcomes evil  truth illuminates the world  and freedom breaks the bondage of tyranny.

Trump to enlist his friends at the National Enquirer and his political henchmen to do his bidding shows you that there is no low Donald won’t go.   These smears are completely false  they’re offensive to Heidi and me  they’re offensive to our daughters  and they’re offensive to everyone Donald continues to personally attack.  Donald Trump’s consistently disgraceful behavior is beneath the office we are seeking and we are not going to follow.

Ted is a consistent  principled conservative who has demonstrated the ability to appeal to voters and win primary contests. Washington is broken  and the only way Republicans can hope to win back the White House and put our nation on a better path is to support a nominee who can articulate how conservative policies will help people rise up and reach their full potential.  For the sake of our party and country  we must move to overcome the divisiveness and vulgarity Donald Trump has brought into the political arena  or we will certainly lose our chance to defeat the Democratic nominee and reverse President Obama’s failed policies. To win  Republicans need to make this election about proposing solutions to the many challenges we face  and I believe that we should vote for Ted as he will do just that.

In a series of co-ordinated attacks they murdered and maimed dozens of innocent commuters at subway stations and travelers at the airport.   For the terrorists  the identities of the victims were irrelevant. They –we—are all part of an intolerable culture that they have vowed to destroy.   For years  the west has tried to deny this enemy exists out of a combination of political correctness and fear. We can no longer afford either.   Our European allies are now seeing what comes of a toxic mix of migrants who have been infiltrated by terrorists and isolated  radical Muslim neighborhoods.   We will do what we can to help them fight this scourge  and redouble our efforts to make sure it does not happen here.   We need to immediately halt the flow of refugees from countries with a significant al Qaida or ISIS presence.   We need to empower law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized.   We need to secure the southern border to prevent terrorist infiltration.  And we need to execute a coherent campaign to utterly destroy ISIS.   The days of the United States voluntarily surrendering to the enemy to show how progressive and enlightened we can be are at an end. Our country is at stake.

Make no mistake -- these terror attacks are no isolated incidents. They are just the latest in a string of coordinated attacks by radical Islamic terrorists perpetrated by those who are waging war against all who do not accept their extreme strain of Islam.   Radical Islam is at war with us. For over seven years we have had a president who refuses to acknowledge this reality. And the truth is  we can never hope to defeat this evil so long as we refuse to even name it. That ends on January 20  2017  when I am sworn in as president.

A so-called ‘moderate’ Democrat nominee is precisely the kind of deal that Donald Trump has told us he would make – someone who would rule along with other liberals on the bench like Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor. Make no mistake  if Garland were confirmed  he would side predictably with President Obama on critical issues such as undermining the Second Amendment  legalizing partial-birth abortion  and propping up overreaching bureaucratic agencies like the EPA and the IRS. We cannot afford to lose the Supreme Court for generations to come by nominating or confirming someone that a dealmaker like Donald Trump would support. Washington dealmakers cannot be trusted with such crucial lifetime appointments.  I proudly stand with my Republican colleagues in our shared belief – our advice and consent – that we should not vote on any nominee until the next president is sworn into office. The People will decide. I commend Mitch McConnell and Chuck Grassley for holding the line and ensuring that We the People get to exercise our authority to decide the direction of the Supreme Court and the Bill of Rights.

To address this  we made a promise during the campaign to strengthen the Canada Pension Plan. This week  we delivered on that promise by signing an historic agreement with the provinces. The deal to expand CPP boosts how much you'll get from your pension - from one-quarter of pensionable earnings now  to fully one third. Simply put  that's more money waiting for you when you retire. To make sure these changes are affordable  we'll phase them in gradually  from 2019 to 2025. This government is committed to helping people retire with dignity - and this week’s agreement is a major step to help make it happen for Canadians from coast to coast to coast.

I knew what I wanted to fight for  but I had no experience with press scrums  fundraising  or grassroots organizing. And besides  a lot of people told me I just couldn’t win. The incumbent Republican I ran against had a 73% approval rating  $10 million in the bank  and a cool truck. Many people didn’t know me from a bag of doorknobs. Oh  and Massachusetts had never elected a woman as senator or governor before—a point many people drove home both publicly and privately.   A lot of good people looked at that election and told me: "He’ll win.  Don’t even try."  Then I got a call from Patty Murray  a longtime champion for working families in the Senate. She said "Run." She knew what issues I cared about  and she talked about how I could fight for those things in the Senate. I heard her out  then I started listing the reasons why I might not be good enough for the job. She listened quietly for a couple of minutes  then cut me off with a voice as sharp as a knife: "Oh  please." She told me that women always think of reasons they aren’t good enough. Men never ask if they’re good enough to hold public office  Patty said. They just ask if they can raise enough money to win.     "Of course you can do this. And I’ll help."  Thank you  Patty.

They had scraped together just enough to buy a house in the best school district for me. And then when I was 12  Daddy had a heart attack. The bills piled up  we lost our station wagon  and we almost lost our home. Daddy had always been quiet – quiet and proud. But for the rest of his life  he was afraid of being poor  really poor. He stayed away from big sores that hurt. I was different: I poked at them.   But Daddy was tickled to watch his baby girl succeed. He convinced my mother to let me apply to college so I could become a teacher. He didn’t think I’d ruin my children when I became a working mom (but he did buy me a fire extinguisher when I set the kitchen on fire). He was glad to tell people I was a law professor and busted his buttons the first time I was quoted in a newspaper. Daddy was proud that I grew up to fight for families like ours. He always said  “That’s my Betsy.”  I remember the Father’s Day that I bought him a new pair of boots. I keep this picture on my dresser  and I smile every time I glance at it.  Happy Father’s Day to all the daddies trying their hardest – and inspiring their little girls (and boys) to do unexpected things.

You understand what others have lost  and honor even more the sacrifice of those who fought for our country and those who love them. One of my proudest moments in Congress was a few weeks ago when President Obama signed a bill I introduced called the National POW/MIA Remembrance Act. This was a bipartisan bill that Massachusetts Rolling Thunder and Rolling Thunder National worked hard to pass that will place a commemorative POW/MIA chair on the grounds of the US Capitol. We honor those who have served our nation with courage  including those who have not made it home – on Memorial Day and every other day too.

We’ve built a whole national holiday around doing something for mom.  But if Mother’s Day is about doing something for all moms  then I think it’s time to focus on the things that would make a real difference. Here’s my list:  1. A mom with a newborn baby should be able to take a little time off to care for her newborn without going bankrupt. The United States is one of only four countries in the entire world that does not guarantee paid leave to new parents.  Private employers aren’t stepping up -- only 12% offer paid family leave.  2. A mom should be able to take off a little time when she’s sick -- or take off a day when her child is sick -- and not worry that she will lose her job or won’t be able to make the rent. 70 percent of low-wage workers don’t get a single paid sick day.   3. A mom should have enough advance notice of her work schedule to plan childcare. Half of low-wage workers have little or no say over when they work  and 20 to 30 percent are in jobs where they can be called in to work at the last minute.  OK  we can’t get Congress to vote today  but we can start pushing in that direction by making mom’s issues important to everyone who is in Congress. We can ask every candidate who wants our vote -- Democrat  Republican  Independent -- will you support paid family leave  paid sick leave  and schedules that work for all? We can raise these issues in line at the grocery store and sitting with other parents at the park. We can post about it. Every time we force this issue into the open  we honor the women in our lives.

It's real – he is one step away from the White House. Here's what else is real:  Trump has built his campaign on racism  sexism  and xenophobia. There's more enthusiasm for him among leaders of the KKK than leaders of the political party he now controls.  He incites supporters to violence  praises Putin  and  according to a columnist who recently interviewed him  is "cool with being called an authoritarian" and doesn't mind associations with history's worst dictators.   He attacks veterans like John McCain who were captured and puts our servicemembers at risk by cheerleading illegal torture. In a world with ISIS militants and leaders like North Korean strongman Kim Jong-Un conducting nuclear tests  he surrounds himself with a foreign policy team that has been called a "collection of charlatans " and puts out contradictory and nonsensical national security ideas one expert recently called "incoherent" and "truly bizarre."    What happens next will test the character for all of us – Republican  Democrat  and Independent. It will determine whether we move forward as one nation or splinter at the hands of one man's narcissism and divisiveness. I know which side I'm on  and I’m going to fight my heart out to make sure Donald Trump’s toxic stew of hatred and insecurity never reaches the White House.

He whined about facing constant attacks  nonexistent family time  his limited health and sleep  and having no personal time.   Are you kidding me? We’re supposed to pity him because trying to be the leader of the free world is hard?! I’ve got two words for you  Ted: Boo hoo.  Know whose health is limited? Workers with no paid leave who can't stay at home when they fall ill or have to care for sick kids. Know whose sleep is limited? Working parents who do everything they can to save money but stay up at night worrying about how do get their kids through college without getting crushed by debt. Know who gets no personal time? People who work two minimum wage jobs to support their families. Know who gets no family time? Moms with unfair schedules who drop their kids off at daycare and drive halfway across town only to find their work hours have been cancelled.   And Ted Cruz? He opposes mandatory paid family and medical leave and calls it "free stuff." He voted against student loan refinancing. He's says the minimum wage is "bad policy" and he's done nothing to try and help workers struggling with unfair work schedules.   And know who’s facing constant attacks  Ted? Hardworking American immigrants  Muslims  LGBT folks  women. They're facing the GOP's constant attacks. They're facing YOUR constant attacks.    Working people are working more and getting paid less. They can't save. Some face mistreatment and discrimination. They can't take time off work for illnesses or to spend time with family. But they don't whine. They don't throw tantrums or try to shut down their workplace because they don't get their way -- and then turn around and demand promotions.  Senator Cruz -- you chose to run for President. Working people don't get a choice. Maybe you should spend less time complaining about your "significant sacrifices" -- and more time trying to do something about theirs.

See how he kept his father’s empire afloat by cheating people with scams like Trump University and by using strategic corporate bankruptcy (excuse me  bankruptcies) to skip out on debt. Listen to the experts who’ve concluded he’s so bad at business that he might have more money today if he’d put his entire inheritance into an index fund and just left it alone.    Trump seems to know he’s a loser. His embarrassing insecurities are on parade: petty bullying  attacks on women  cheap racism  and flagrant narcissism. But just because Trump is a loser everywhere else doesn’t mean he’ll lose this election. People have been underestimating his campaign for nearly a year – and it’s time to wake up.   People talk about how "this is the most important election" in our lifetime every four years  and it gets stale. But consider what hangs in the balance. Affordable college. Accountability for Wall Street. Healthcare for millions of Americans. The Supreme Court.  Big corporations and billionaires paying their fair share of taxes.  Expanded Social Security. Investments in infrastructure and medical research and jobs right here in America. The chance to turn our back on the ugliness of hatred  sexism  racism and xenophobia. The chance to be a better people.    More than anyone we’ve seen before come within reach of the presidency  Donald Trump stands ready to tear apart an America that was built on values like decency  community  and concern for our neighbors. Many of history’s worst authoritarians started out as losers – and Trump is a serious threat. The way I see it  it’s our job to make sure he ends this campaign every bit the loser that he started it.

Jo Cox was a voice of compassion  whose irrepressible spirit and boundless energy lit up the lives of all those who knew her and saved the lives of many she never even met.  Today we grieve her loss – and hold in our hearts and prayers her husband Brendan  her parents and sister  and her two children  who are just three and five years old.  We express our anger at the sickening and despicable attack that killed her as she did her job  serving her constituents on the streets of Birstall.   But above all  in this House  we pay tribute to a loving  determined  passionate and progressive politician who epitomised the best of humanity and who proved so often the power of politics to make our world a better place.  I first met Jo in 2006 in Darfur. She was doing what she was so brilliant at – bravely working in one of the most dangerous parts of the world  fighting for the lives of refugees.   Her decision to welcome me – then a Conservative Leader of the Opposition – had not been entirely welcomed by all of her colleagues and friends.  But it was typical of her determination to reach across party lines on issues she felt were so much more important than party politics.  Jo was a humanitarian to her core. A passionate and brilliant campaigner  whose grit and determination to fight for justice saw her time and again driving issues up the agenda and making people listen and act.  Drawing attention to conflicts in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Helping to expose the practice of rape in war. Her work with Sarah Brown on cutting mortality in childbirth. Her support for refugees fleeing the war in Syria.  Quite simply  there are people on our planet today who are only here because of Jo.  Mr Speaker  Jo was a committed democrat and a passionate feminist. She spent years encouraging and supporting women around the world to stand for office  long before she did so herself.  When she herself was elected as an MP just over a year ago she said to one of her colleagues that she did not just want to be known for flying around the world tackling international issues but that she had a profound duty to stand up for the people of Batley and Spen.  And she was absolutely as good as her word.  As she said in her maiden speech  Jo was proud to be made in Yorkshire and to serve the area in which she had grown up.   She belonged there - and in a constituency of truly multi-ethnic  multi-faith communities  she made people feel they belonged there too.   Jo’s politics were inspired by love.  And the outpouring and unity of the tributes we have seen in these past few days show the extraordinary reach and impact of her message.  For in remembering Jo we show today that what she said in this House is true: “we are far more united and have far more in common with each other than things that divide us.”  This Wednesday on what would have been Jo’s 42nd birthday there will be a global celebration of her life and values with simultaneous events in New York and Washington  London and Batley  Brussels and Geneva  Nairobi and Beirut.  She should of course have been celebrating her birthday by hosting her traditional summer solstice party.  And it reminds us that behind the formidable professional  was a loving  fun  mother  daughter  sister  wife and friend with a warm  welcoming smile and often  laughter in her voice.   Jo brought people together. She saw the best in people and brought out the best in them.   A brave adventurer and a keen climber  she was never daunted.   When most people hear of a place called the Inaccessible Pinnacle  they leave it well alone. Not Jo.   She didn’t just climb it  she abseiled down it  and did so despite a bad case of morning sickness.  And it was her irrepressible spirit that helped to give her such determination and focus in her politics too.    As a Conservative colleague of mine said this weekend: “if you lost your way for a moment in the cut and thrust of political life – meeting Jo would remind you why you went into politics.”   Mr Speaker  there have been so many moving tributes in the past few days.   But if I may  I would like to quote from one – from the Hon Member for Wirral South.  Jo – “we mourn your loss  yet know that all you stood for is unbreakable...   ...we promise to stand up  even though we are broken....   ...we promise that we will never be cowed by hate.”  Mr Speaker  may we and the generations of Members that follow us in this House honour Jo’s memory by proving that the democracy and freedoms Jo stood for are indeed unbreakable  by continuing to stand up for our constituents and by uniting against the hatred that killed her  today and for evermore.

Jo wasn’t yet a household name  but was already known in Westminster as a brilliant young MP and campaigner. Principled  energetic and down-to-earth  she was incredibly passionate about the causes she believed in. She cared about her constituents.  She cared about our country. And she cared deeply about the plight of people who were suffering around the world. For me  Jo embodied Britain at her best – a country that is decent and compassionate; one that reaches out to make the world a better place. Our public life is poorer for her loss. We will miss her  and we pray for her family and friends.  It is not easy  in the wake of Jo’s murder  to turn to the question of Thursday’s referendum. But we must. For  as Jo had been pointing out so effectively over these past few months  our country now stands at a crossroads. We face an existential choice on Thursday. This country has a big decision to make – and there is so much at stake.  First  our economy hangs in the balance. Today  Britain is on course to be one of the big success stories of the twenty first century – growing faster this year than any other advanced economy in the world except America. We’re an open  dynamic  trading nation. Indeed  the single market we are part of inside the EU was practically a British invention. It is simply common sense that if we left  trade would be damaged  and investment in Britain would suffer because businesses would no longer be able to access the EU from Britain in the same way. Our economy would therefore be smaller.  Now  there has been a lot of debate about the precise impact of this; whether we’d suffer a ‘mild’ recession quickly after leaving  or if it would be a much more severe shock. There’s been a discussion about exactly how much unemployment would go up by. There’s been debate about precisely how much poorer Britain would be for the long term. And there’s been speculation about the true size of the black hole that would open up in the public finances.  But try and find a single credible voice who predicts that Britain will actually be better-off  more economically secure and better able to fund our public services if we left Europe. There isn’t one. And so it’s no surprise that there hasn’t been any serious attempt from the Leave Campaign to contest the central economic facts of this referendum: that Britain will be worse off if we left; that there’d be no saving from leaving  only a cost; that there’d be no gain  just pain. A probable recession. Debilitating uncertainty – perhaps for a decade until things were sorted. Higher prices  lower wages  fewer jobs  fewer opportunities for young people. A permanently poorer country in every sense. How could we knowingly vote for that? I say: don’t risk it.  Second  Britain’s place in the world is also at stake in this referendum. I’ve been Prime Minister for six years. And I can tell you: Britain is a stronger force in the world when we’re working from the inside as part of the world’s most important organisations. Whether it’s the UN  NATO or the European Union  we have a seat where it really matters. When we want to effect change in the world – whether to advance our national interest  protect the security of our people or alleviate suffering in the world – the levers we reach for are invariably found within these organisations.  If we leave the EU  it will still be a very important forum for sorting out the biggest problems that affect Britain. The difference is: we just wouldn’t be there. It will still take decisions to tackle terrorism  climate change and migration. We just wouldn’t be in the room when it happens. In fact  the first thing we’d do if we left is establish a huge diplomatic operation to lobby EU countries before their meetings happened  and then spend weeks afterwards trying to find out what on earth had happened  and how it might affect us. It would be a one-off and permanent diminution in our standing in the world; an abject and self-imposed humiliation for a proud and important country like ours. That’s why all of our major allies want us to remain; only our adversaries want us to leave. I say: we are not one twenty-eighth of the EU; we are one hugely important  global player. And that is exactly how we should stay.  Finally  there is this question about the kind of country we want to be. I’m so proud of Britain – this open  tolerant  big-hearted country of ours. But I believe this referendum has now become a watershed moment for our country. And we are going to have to make a defining decision on Thursday: are we going to choose Nigel Farage’s vision– one which takes Britain backwards; divides rather than unites; and questions the motives of anyone who takes a different view. Or will we  instead  choose the tolerant  liberal Britain; a country that doesn’t blame its problems on other groups of people; one that doesn’t pine for the past  but looks to the future with hope  optimism and confidence? I think the answer will determine what our country feels like for a very long time.  Of course the EU is not perfect. But in a way  our membership of it is the fundamental expression of our Britishness – outward-looking  compassionate  engaged – and yes  sceptical  too. So much is at stake on Thursday. And so rarely will we ever make a decision of such magnitude. And here’s the thing: it’s irreversible. There is no turning back if we leave. If we choose to go out of the EU  we will go out – with all of the consequences that will have for everyone in Britain. And if we were to leave and it quickly turned out to be a big mistake  there wouldn’t be a way of changing our minds and having another go. This is it.  So ask yourself: have I really heard anything – anything at all – to convince me that leaving would be the best thing for the economic security of my family? Is walking away really in keeping with the important  influential country that Britain has always been? Is leaving going to build the kind of open  compassionate country I want my children and grandchildren to grow up in? And if you’re not sure  don’t take the risk of leaving. If you’re not one hundred per cent persuaded  there’s only one place to put your cross. If you don’t know  don’t go. Instead  vote to remain on June 23rd.

Far from using it to do my bit for Brexit  I have been imagining how it would feel to wake up to that result on June 24. There would not be elation or freedom but a profound sense that something had been lost — and guilt  too  if my vote had contributed to the turmoil ahead.  It’s far easier as a politician to stick immovably to a declared position  but more honest to set out why I will now be voting for Britain to remain a member of the EU.  I came into politics to campaign on health  so I’ve listened carefully to the evidence from both sides on this. The claims about health from the Leave campaign have been shameful.  They have knowingly placed a financial lie at the heart of their campaign  even emblazoning it on their battle bus  alongside the NHS branding  to imply a financial bonanza. It’s an empty promise and one which would soon backfire. A strong economy has always been the cornerstone of funding for the NHS and for all the arguments about the scale of the economic turbulence  the clear consensus is that the effects of Brexit would be significant and negative.  Far from a leave dividend there would be an economic penalty and the NHS would suffer the consequences. The chilling effect would also fall on the workforce. If you meet a migrant in the NHS  they are more likely to be treating you than ahead of you in the queue and very many of our core health and social care workforce come from the EU. How does it feel for them? I know how intensely painful many of my EU constituents have found the tone of the debate.  The NHS is not a passive beneficiary of a strong economy  health is a key driver for economic growth. Listening to the evidence  the EU has played a positive role in promoting good health  whether in water and air quality  or the scientific research of which the UK is clearly a beneficiary. We contribute 11 per cent of the EU research budget and receive 16 per cent of its allocated funding.  The UK also plays a leadership role in the surveillance  shared intelligence and response to the health threats which are no respecters of national boundaries  as evidenced by our ability to respond to the ebola outbreak  saving countless lives.  Could services  research and public health be put at risk in the event of a vote to leave the EU? I believe the balance of evidence is that the isolation and instability of Brexit should come with a health warning.  In recent weeks I have also observed the professionalism and care of the NHS from my father’s bedside as he recovered from a heart attack and a triple bypass. We had time for long conversations about the referendum and our place in Europe. Now 81  as a teenager he was trained as a mine clearance diver with the Royal Navy. For him  the risk of war in Europe is not some abstract debate but a horror against which the EU  for all its imperfections  has brought us protection.  The Leave campaign has redrawn its battle lines around immigration for the final weeks of the campaign and looks increasingly indistinguishable from Ukip.  This has been an unnecessarily acrimonious and divisive campaign. It has also highlighted the scale of our disconnect from the European institutions which control so many aspects of our daily lives. If the outcome is to remain  we urgently need to reset that relationship and make our voices count in Europe.  Dr Sarah Wollaston is Conservative MP for Totnes

Our joint article on the importance of protecting jobs  wages and prices at this referendum:  "A former trade union leader and a Conservative prime minister have never before put pen to paper together. We do so today in very special circumstances. With the prospects for working people all across Britain at stake on 23 June  it is right that the rules of conventional politics be temporarily set aside.   There are  of course  many things on which the two of us disagree. But we are united in our conviction that Britain  and Britain’s workers  will be better off in a reformed Europe than out on our own.  While staying in Europe offers workers in the UK the best prospects of rising prosperity  leaving poses what we call a triple threat: to working people’s jobs  to their wages and to the prices we all pay in the shops. Let us take each in turn.  First  the risk to jobs. Even some prominent campaigners on the leave side are now agreed on this – leaving the European Union will cause an economic shock. Let’s be clear about what that means: an economic downturn; people losing their jobs and livelihoods; parents left unable to provide for their families.   An independent estimate by the accountancy firm PwC states that unemployment could rise to 8% by 2020  compared with just 5% if we stay in the EU.  That’s bad enough  but there would be a longer-term consequence too. As last week’s Treasury analysis showed  Britain’s GDP will be permanently lower than it would otherwise be – around 6% lower by 2030  the equivalent of £4 300 for every household in the country.   So let there be no doubt about what leaving the EU means: an immediate shock  and then a permanently poorer country.  That leads us to the second threat: wages. It’s clear there will be long-term damage for our country’s productivity  caused by the second-rate  more restrictive trade relationship we would have to try to negotiate if we left our home market of 500 million consumers. Less open trading leads to lower productivity.  And we must be equally clear about what that means for working people: even if they keep their jobs  their wages will be lower than they would otherwise have been. That would be a disaster for working people  and it will be those industries that rely on exporting to Europe the most – manufacturing and services – that will be hit hardest.  So it doesn’t matter whether you work in a car plant  a factory  a shop or an office: the likelihood is that you would take home less money at the end of every month than if we had stayed in Europe.   And let’s not forget that  while the two of us may disagree about quite how far this process should go  being in Europe has helped to deliver many of the crucial rights that underpin fairness at work.   Paid holidays  maternity rights  equal treatment for the millions of people working part-time  protections for agency workers  even equal pay for women at work: all are guaranteed by Europe and all could be at risk if we left.  Of course  slower growth will feed through to the public finances too. It would hit our tax revenues  generating less money to pay the wages of public sector workers such as nurses and teachers. So we face a vicious circle that will hurt the lowest-paid workers in every part of our economy – public and private sector alike.  The third threat is rising prices. It’s quite simple: most independent experts agree that leaving Europe would put pressure on the pound. Indeed  we’re seeing that pressure already as fears grow of Britain leaving the EU. A weak pound means more expensive goods and higher inflation  pushing up the prices of the weekly shop  clothes  petrol – anything that we import from other countries.   So we are likely to see the cost of living going up  just as wages are being squeezed and jobs lost. That is the threat for families already struggling to make ends meet – and a risk that working people and the poorest in our country simply cannot afford.  So the choice before us is becoming clearer each day. We can risk jobs  hold down wages and pay higher prices. We can be the first major economy in history to deliberately choose a second-rate trading arrangement for our biggest market. We can take needless risks with our economy that would unleash a triple threat to working people – and become a poorer country in every sense.  Or  if we choose to stay in the EU  we can protect working people and the poorest families. We can choose stability and economic security – a bright future with more jobs  higher pay and lower prices.  As you make that choice  remember this: on the leavers’ side there is a real lack of credible experts to support their case. And there is a troubling dogma in their rigid belief that  in the face of all evidence to the contrary  taking these risks will be worth the pain they will cause.   The leavers now say they want the UK to be like Albania  which even the Albanian prime minister says is “weird”  because his country wants to be more like us.  On our side  however  we have a collection of independent experts  trustworthy organisations and friends of Britain from around the world. Whether it is the Bank of England  our universities  the trade unions  employers large and small in every part of our economy  the IMF  President Obama  our allies in Nato or the Commonwealth  the message is the same: Britain is better off in Europe.  Of course  the leavers say this must be some sort of conspiracy masterminded by shadowy international elites. All we have to say is: to have been able to bring even the two of us together today  these evil geniuses must be very good.  For the sake of every worker in Britain  we urge you: vote to remain."

This is the world we could wake up in if we leave Europe – with the massive knock-on effect on jobs  prices and living standards in our country.   Because the longer this referendum campaign goes on  the clearer it becomes: those campaigning to leave Europe are inviting the British people to make an extraordinary choice – to be the first major economy in history to deliberately choose a second-rate  more restrictive trading relationship for its biggest market.   They want to rip up our membership of the single market – a market that Britain practically invented – in the hope of renegotiating a new arrangement.   We are duty bound to take this proposition very seriously.  So let us properly examine the consequences for our economy. What would a new tailored arrangement  of the sort Canada or Switzerland have with Europe  mean for us?  If we take the Canada free trade deal as a guide  we know it would be damaging for agriculture and manufacturing. Our beef and pork exports would face tariffs  and our car manufacturers forced to comply with rules imposing additional costs based on where they buy their components.  And  of course  there is British steel. We are doing everything we can to help British steel in these difficult times  but the idea that leaving Europe is the answer is a dangerous fallacy: more than half of our steel exports go to Europe. As Stephen Kinnock  the local MP has said  the last thing his constituents in Port Talbot need is to be cut off from Europe.  Leaving the single market would also hit our service industries hard – and this is where our economy faces the biggest risk.  Today  British brainpower and ingenuity are in demand. We’re the country that designs the building  advises on the deal  arranges the finance  insures the business  draws up the contracts  produces the film  creates the advertising campaign  sells the product and audits the accounts. All these are service industries.  The figures speak for themselves. Our service industries are growing at a rate of nearly three per cent a year on average. They account for almost 80 per cent of our economy. And they amount to 40 per cent of all British exports – with Europe being by far our biggest market.   Indeed  an extraordinary 116 000 small businesses export services to the EU. And new analysis shows that two million jobs are either directly or indirectly linked to these exports.  Each of these jobs represents someone with a pay packet; someone providing for themselves and their families. As politicians  we have a duty to tell them what we think the future holds. I can tell each of them  with certainty  that if we stay in Europe their employer will keep the current guaranteed rights to offer services anywhere in the EU.  Those advocating leave can do no such thing. No real-world alternative to EU membership would come close to what we have now. Even the most ambitious trade deal on services the EU has ever struck – with Canada – falls radically short of single-market access.  The latest draft of the Canada deal runs to over 1 500 pages – 800 of which are reservations and barriers. A huge proportion of the deal is about restricting business opportunities  not opening them up. We could see new barriers for British business in every key services sector.   Here are just three examples. One: aviation. Currently  UK airlines are free to operate routes both between and within other EU member states. But under their deal  Canadian airlines are only allowed to operate routes in Europe if they start or end at a Canadian airport. If this rule was applied to British airlines  they would have to scrap hundreds of routes.  Two: broadcasting. Under EU rules  once a broadcaster is licensed in one member state  it can broadcast in all. If we replicated Canada’s deal  companies would have to choose between seeking separate licences in all EU states they want to broadcast in  or moving out of the UK altogether.  And of course  there’s our biggest service industry: financial services. Half of all international financial firms base their European headquarters in the UK. From their one office here  EU membership allows them to do business in all 27 other EU states.   If we left  this right would be lost and thousands of firms could be forced to move staff or entire offices out of the UK and into the EU  meaning fewer jobs and less tax revenue for the UK.  People might say: “So what? Surely Britain will get a better deal than Canada or Switzerland? The EU needs Britain more than we need the EU.” That misunderstands the negotiation dynamics that would be at play. The EU buys £21 billion more of services from us – one country – than we buy from the 27 countries in the EU.   In fact  of everything we sell abroad  44 per cent goes to the EU  but of everything the EU exports  less than 8 per cent comes to the UK. How can those dynamics be good for the UK?  Governments in the EU would come under tremendous pressure from their domestic firms to discriminate against the UK. And who is to say they wouldn’t take the opportunity? After all  why wouldn’t the Spanish protect their largest telecoms provider? Why wouldn’t the Germans try to give a leg-up to their insurance companies? Why wouldn’t France adopt protectionist measures to penalise British banks?  When you look at the consequences of leaving this market  you have to ask: why on earth would we do this to ourselves? I believe it would be needless and reckless – an act of economic and political self-harm.  In June  we can choose Britain’s future. We can choose to shape our world  not to be shaped by others. We can choose to stay in the biggest single market on Earth. We can choose economic security  not an unnecessary leap in the dark.   We can choose to be stronger  safer and better off – and that’s what I hope the British people will do when the moment comes.

We see that hope every day in the many faith-inspired projects that help the homeless  that get people into work  that help keep families together and offer loving homes to children who need them.   We see it in the compassion of church leaders and volunteers who visit our hospitals  care homes and hospices - and those who comfort the bereaved.   And we see that hope in the aid workers and volunteers who so often risk their own lives to save the lives of others in war-torn regions across the world.   And at the heart of all these acts of kindness and courage is a set of values and beliefs that have helped to make our country what it is today.   Values of responsibility  hard work  charity  compassion and pride in working for the common good and honouring the social obligations we have to one another  to our families and to our communities.   These are values we treasure.   They are Christian values and they should give us the confidence to say yes  we are a Christian country and we are proud of it.   But they are also values that speak to everyone in Britain – to people of every faith and none.   And we must all stand together and defend them.   When we see Christians today in 2016 being persecuted for their beliefs - we must speak out and stand with those who bravely practice their faith.   And when terrorists try to destroy our way of life as they have tried to do again so despicably in Brussels this week - we must stand together and show that we will never be cowed by terror.   We must defeat the pernicious ideology that is the root cause of this terrorism by standing up proudly for our values and our way of life.    So this Easter as we pray for the friends and families of all those who lost loved ones in Brussels let us also draw hope and inspiration from the values we share and from all those who - inspired by those values - seek to help others in our country and around the world.   And let me wish you and your family a very happy Easter.

Third  the single market lets the EU strike the most ambitious & comprehensive trade deals with the world.

The Jewish community has made an enormous contribution to our Party and our country – Jewish people have been at the heart of progressive and radical politics in Britain.  But they are also a minority amongst minorities and have had good cause to feel vulnerable and even threatened throughout history. This should never happen by accident or design in our Labour Party.

Neither wing of the Tory government has an exit plan. Labour will now ensure that our reform agenda is at the heart of the negotiations that lie ahead. That includes the freedom to shape our economy for the future and the necessity of protecting social and employment rights.

Millions of voters have rejected a political establishment that has left them behind. Communities that have been hardest hit by government cuts and economic failure have voted against the status quo.  The first task is to come together and heal the divisions. Our country is divided and things need to change. Politicians on all sides must respect the decision of the British people.  Ours is the only party that can meet the challenge we now face. Labour is best placed to re-unite the country. We can do so because we didn’t engage in project fear  and because we share people’s dissatisfaction with the status quo. That was why we put a case for both remain and reform.  I will be making clear to both Remain and Leave voters that Labour will fight for the exit negotiations to be accountable to an open  transparent parliamentary process. And we’ll do everything to secure the best deal for the people of Britain at every stage.  We cannot leave it to the Conservative Party – who have shown time and time again that they can’t be trusted to stand up for working people.   The Prime Minister has resigned and the Tories are deeply divided at a time when the country needs to come together and we need stability to head off economic crisis.   I want to thank all our campaigners  from Alan Johnson – who chaired Labour’s campaign – to our whole Shadow Cabinet  and to members in constituencies across the whole country  for their tireless campaigning and commitment to social justice.

"Equality is one of the European Union’s founding values – explicit in the Lisbon treaty  the charter of fundamental rights  and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. It was hardwired into the EU from the beginning.  Of course some may suggest that the battle has been won on women’s rights and that there is no more left to do. But that would be to forget the dogged opposition to progress we have encountered every step of the way  as well as the worrying actions and words of the Tories and UKIP.  Women’s rights are in the firing line whenever there’s a call for deregulation or “cutting red tape”. Under this Tory government  levels of maternity discrimination in the workplace are soaring  and as of the last budget  86% of the net savings made to the treasury through tax and benefit changes will have come from women. The question on 23rd June has to be: would you trust either the Tories or UKIP to uphold hard won rights for women? ... Our equality  our prosperity  our rights and our future  and that of our daughters and granddaughters depend on women voting to remain in Europe."

Those feelings were compounded as I watched the clip of Mark Longhurst hosting Sky Papers with Owen Jones and Julia Hartley-Brewer. ... Finally  because Owen’s experience about why these events were so personal despite  I assume  having never been to Pulse in Orlando  was dismissed out of hand. The Guardian columnist may never have been to that particular bar but Pulse will be like so many other gays bars across the world  Pink Punters included."

I have seen first-hand the jobs  investment  workers’ rights and environmental protection that being part of the EU helps secure for working people.  That’s why  despite its faults  I believe it’s best we vote to stay and work with our friends to make the changes Europe needs."

Simon Woolley  Director of Operation Black Vote  powerfully stated yesterday:  "The symbolism of Marvin winning cannot be overstated. Bristol made its vast wealth in slavery. Slave owners such as Edward Colston have statues and institutions throughout the city.  Bristol has for some time struggled with acknowledging its dark past  much less effectively dealing with it. But with Marvin – a descendent of those enslaved – perhaps Bristol takes a truly redemptive step to modernisation.  And in doing so Rees becomes not only the first directly elected city mayor of Caribbean-African decent in the UK  but also Europe.  Rees's victory changes British politics forever.

We’ve increased our vote share since 2015.  We won the most councillors across the country – more than any other party.  We were expected to lose lots of key councils – and we didn’t.  Carwyn Jones has held Wales for Labour  so that we can continue to deliver for all the people of Wales.  I want to pay tribute to Kezia Dugdale for running such a principled and energetic campaign in Scotland. We know that convincing the Scottish electorate that it is Labour not the SNP that will stand up for them will take time.  Sadiq Khan won the first Mayoral election for Labour since 2004  smashing a campaign of division from David Cameron’s candidate. They put out more leaflets with pictures of me and Sadiq than they did telling people what they would do for London.  And against all the odds and predictions we’ve won a stunning victory in Bristol with Marvin Rees winning for Labour overwhelmingly. I took the congratulations and thanks of party members everywhere to Bristol today to make sure Marvin knows how delighted we all are.  These results are happening as more and more people are coming to see David Cameron’s government as failed and unfair. Our message of hope and opportunity and that Britain is better off with Labour  is really beginning to hit home. Labour is standing up  not standing by.  The need for our work campaigning continues  so today in Manchester Tom Watson began his European referendum tour mobilising members. Tom is travelling around the country as part of our 'Labour In for Britain' campaign. Find out when there is an event near you: http://www.tom-watson.com/eu_referendum_tour  Over the coming months I look forward to continue putting forward our vision for Britain. Together  as a party and a movement  we can take the next steps in our campaign to change our country.

The House of Lords again voted to put Labour's Lord Dubs' proposal into the Immigration Bill because it is the moral thing to do. 26 000 child refugees entered Europe last year and Europol say 10 000 have gone missing and it's feared this is a result of child trafficking.

The NHS is our greatest creation and these doctors are defending it.   Jeremy Hunt  the Tory Health Secretary  has refused to listen and negotiate with the junior doctors - he could have avoided today's action.     It is a decision junior doctors have found agonising to make. Every doctor I’ve asked  "why are you striking?"  says it is because Jeremy Hunt's new contract is not safe for patients and is not sustainable for the NHS.   The contract proposed by the Conservative government does not recognise junior doctors' work on Saturdays as unsociable and does not provide the support staff that will be needed under their plans. Junior doctors are already overworked and the NHS already operates 24 hours a day  7 days per week with junior doctors at its heart.   And let’s not be misled by the term “junior doctors”. They are junior in name only  not by status. They make life-and-death decisions  perform surgery and they are often in charge of whole teams. This contract affects all those doctors on the long pathway to GP or consultant roles. They are trained professionals who account for a third of our medical workforce.    So there is nothing “junior” about them. They are the lifeblood of our NHS; they have a wealth of experience and education that is an asset to our country. That is why today and when the strike continues tomorrow because no doubt Jeremy Hunt will continue to refuse to negotiate; I am with the junior doctors.

The youngest victim was just 10  Jon-Paul Gilhooley  and the oldest was 67 years old  Gerard Bernard Patrick Baron. These were fans that went to a football match  as so many of us do  on the 15th April 1989  but never returned to their loved ones.    I pay tribute to the families and friends of all the victims of the tragedy – as well as many others from the city of Liverpool - for the passionate and dignified campaign they have fought for almost three decades. Today they received total vindication for their fight for the truth and for justice.   In the immediate aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster there were some who painted those that died and the fans of Liverpool FC as drunken yobs and thieves. The findings of this inquest clearly show that to have been a lie - fan behaviour didn't cause or contribute to the disaster and the fans have been exonerated of any blame.   All those that attended the semi-final 27 years ago were innocent victims and it is time that those who peddled those vile and malicious lies recognise the deep hurt they have inflicted on tens of thousands of innocent people - and are held to account.

It is a universal message of the struggle for liberation and freedom  and one that continues to inspire many who fight for justice and equality all over the world.   The 19th century Rabbi of the North London Synagogue  Joseph Morris  summed up its meaning when he said: “Passover affirms the great truth that liberty is the inalienable right of every human being."

On the day that parents will find out if their child has a place at their school of choice  it is increasingly clear that the Government has no answer to the crisis in school places they have created.  The same figures suggest that 87 primary schools in England now have more than 800 pupils – up from just 16 five years ago – and the number of infants in class sizes of over 30 pupils is also at its highest rate for 15 years.  Labour's shadow Education Secretary Lucy Powell said  "The Tories’ new forced academisation policy will make the school places system implode  as councils lose completely the levers they have to ensure there are enough school places for children."

I know this is a very important and special time for Sikhs in the UK  India and across the world.   Vaisakhi marks the birth of the Khalsa and Sikhs are celebrating across the UK in Gurdwaras  homes and in processions in lots of our towns and cities.  We can learn much from the Sikh way of life. Gurdwaras are impressive places of worship in the way that they serve free food to everyone  be they a worshipper or just somebody in need of a hot meal. I'm particularly taken by the story of Emperor Akbar who  in 1569  was told by the 3rd Sikh Guru to sit and share a meal with the poor and the penniless before meeting the Guru. The concepts of social justice and true equality - gender  race  religion  ethnicity - of respect for each other  of treating everyone the same  regardless of where you were born or what background you are from  are concepts shared by the Labour Party.  The Gurus fought against social inequality  fought against injustice  and helped the most vulnerable in society to live their lives with dignity and pride. The creation of the Khalsa by the tenth Sikh Guru  in a ceremony underpinned by personal sacrifice  gave Sikhs a visible identity that ensured they would stand out and that they wouldn’t walk by when they saw injustice or somebody in need.  These are values that we in the Labour Party also share.   The Labour Party wants to build a fairer society where all have the same opportunities in life. We want a Britain which works for all of us  not just the few  a vision of the future with fairness and shared prosperity at its heart and we look forward to working with you.  At this time  we also recognise the huge contribution of the Sikh community to our business  culture and public life in Britain. I wish you and your families a very Happy Vaisakhi.   Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa; Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh.

And immediately initiate a review into tackling costs hitting the sector from high business rates and energy costs.  3) Fast-track key infrastructure projects requiring large amounts of steel – Set up an Emergency Investment Programme prioritising ‘shovel ready’ projects already in the government’s infrastructure pipeline which could help boost domestic demand.  4)Restructure the steel industry to make it more viable for the future needs of Britain – Engage with the workforce  management and customers to turn around the industry  laying out a strategy for the steel industry in the 21st century.

When you use those savings to cut taxes for the wealthy  you really are tipping over into the callous and cruel. But that’s what the chancellor George Osborne is trying to do. ... Our strength as a country has always been the help we give to one another.  Let’s make sure George Osborne hears the voices of the majority - and together let’s defeat his ugly plan to attack support for disabled people.  Sign & share our petition: labour.org.uk/pip

Whilst offering tax breaks to the wealthiest  he's slashing Personal Independence Payments for people living with disabilities.   Please sign and share our petition now!  Hundreds of thousands of disabled people will lose on average £3 500 a year: money to support the very basics like getting help to dress  leave the house  or go to the bathroom.  The Labour Party is standing up and demanding the Tories reverse these cruel and callous cuts  but we need your help.

This confirms what our shadow chancellor John McDonnell and I have been saying since September - austerity is a political choice not an economic necessity. Their cuts are both brutal and unnecessary.   Their ‘long-term economic’ plan hasn't - as promised - eradicated the deficit."  Later I'll be on the doorstep with Labour activists who have been campaigning on our Economy Action Day as The Labour Party are offering an alternative to this Tory Government.

He was a Prime Minister who made Britain more equal - and there is no better accolade than that.   He was a proud Yorkshireman whose outlook was shaped by his experiences. He became an MP in 1945 when Labour was swept to power with a mandate to transform Britain through the introduction of the welfare state.   He is most remembered for radical changes to the law which gave people control of their own lives. In response to the Ford Dagenham machinists’ strike of 1968 – immortalised by the film Made in Dagenham – Wilson’s government passed the Equal Pay Act. His government boosted women’s equality by liberalising divorce laws and legalising abortion under certain conditions.   Crucial steps were taken by Wilson governments towards stopping discrimination against ethnic minorities and he ensured homosexuality was decriminalised. A seminal moment of Wilson’s social reforms was when he abolished capital punishment.   He famously tried to harness the ‘white heat of the technological revolution’ to modernise the British economy. He knew that a strong economy relied on a healthy and educated workforce. He prioritised the building of high quality homes for everyone and he created the Open University which – to this day – gives thousands of people opportunities to build successful careers with new qualifications.   One of his achievements  which is often forgotten  is his decision not to take Britain into the Vietnam War  despite huge pressure from the US president Lyndon Johnson.  His position as an internationalist was secured when he oversaw the independence of Zambia  Gambia  Zimbabwe  Botswana  Lesotho  Mauritius and Swaziland. This was no surprise to his peers as he was a member of the Movement for Colonial Freedom  now called Liberation  of which I was a Chair.   Harold Wilson’s accomplishments as Prime Minister demonstrate the best values of the British Labour Party: equality  internationalism  and social justice.   The year before his time as Prime Minister came to an end  Britain had the lowest levels of inequality in our history. That was his legacy  he made Britain more equal.

The NHS is under pressure as a direct result of decisions Tory Ministers have made. They cut older people’s home care  meaning hospitals have become dangerously full  and cuts to nurse training places have forced hospitals to drain resources hiring expensive agency staff.   As Labour's Shadow Health Secretary  Heidi Alexander  said earlier today: "Rather than take action to repair the damage they’ve done  Tory Ministers are taking a huge gamble with the future of our NHS. They’ve got no plan to tackle the financial crisis facing hospitals  and no plan to address the funding black hole in social care."

When I was elected leader of the Labour Party last September I was determined to bring a new kind of politics to Westminster. And as part of that  I made a commitment to do Prime Minister’s Questions in a different way as well.  At one point David Cameron agreed that we should do things differently; he once said he was “fed up with the Punch and Judy politics of Westminster”. But the experience of the last six months suggests he has come to rather enjoy it.  From support for the steel industry  to cuts to flood defence schemes and the Tories’ cruel and unfair Bedroom Tax  David Cameron has been unable to defend his Government’s record at PMQs.  People want a different sort of politics. I’m determined to respond to that. Unfortunately  the Prime Minister has so far been unable to get beyond the political game-playing of the past.

In the implementation of the health care law and many other significant matters  the Obama Administration has engaged in historic overreach that has exceeded the bounds of the president’s authority and deepened the distrust many Americans feel toward their government. The president of the United States is not a king or a monarch  with the ability to singlehandedly create or change the laws of our country.  And as I said in 2014 when I first announced we would initiate this legal action  the House has a responsibility to ensure the separation of powers in our democratic system remains clear  as the Framers intended.

There is no doubt that he successfully tapped into the deep sense of anger and frustration so many Americans around the country rightfully feel today.   The tremendous anger of the current U.S. electorate – whether Republican  Democrat or independent – is a result of people fearful about the future  concerned with the direction of our country and tremendously frustrated by the abject failure and inability of leaders in Washington  D.C. to make anything better.   American voters have made it clear that Washington is broken  but I’m not optimistic that either of the leading candidates for President will put us on a better course.   The American Presidency is an office that goes beyond just politics. It requires of its occupant great fortitude and humility and the temperament and strong character to deal with the unexpected challenges that will inevitably impact our nation in the next four years.   Donald Trump has not demonstrated that temperament or strength of character. He has not displayed a respect for the Constitution. And  he is not a consistent conservative. These are all reasons why I cannot support his candidacy.   Hillary Clinton has proven to be an untrustworthy liberal politician who  if elected  would present a third term of the disastrous foreign and economic policy agenda of Barack Obama.   In November  I will not vote for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton  but I will support principled conservatives at the state and federal levels  just as I have done my entire life. For Republicans  there is no greater priority than ensuring we keep control of both chambers of Congress. I look forward to working hard for great conservatives in the Senate and House in the coming months.

Ted is a consistent  principled conservative who has demonstrated the ability to appeal to voters and win primary contests  including yesterday’s Utah caucus.   As I said from the moment I launched my presidential campaign  the stakes in 2016 couldn’t be higher.   Washington is broken  too many families are stuck in poverty and Western civilization is under attack from radical Islamic terrorists  as evidenced by the horrific attack in Brussels  which was preceded by attacks in Paris and California.   For the sake of our party and country  we must overcome the divisiveness and vulgarity Donald Trump has brought into the political arena or we will certainly lose our chance to defeat the Democratic nominee  most likely Hillary Clinton  this fall.    That is the only way we can reverse President Obama’s failed domestic and foreign policy agenda  and turn our country around.     Republicans can win back the White House and put our nation on a path to security and prosperity if we support a nominee who can unite our party and articulate how conservative policies will help people rise up and reach their full potential.   I hope you will join me in supporting Ted’s campaign by visiting www.tedcruz.org  and contributing and volunteering.

What stronger  fiercer love can there be than a mother’s love?  I remember once when we were planting trees in a paddock and little Alex  not yet two  was playing nearby.   Lucy and I both looked up and saw a brown snake between us and Alex. Without a word she leapt through the air  over the snake  scooped up Alex and in another equally enormous bound was many metres away. It seemed to happen in an instant. I have never seen anyone move so fast.   Another time  smoke started to fill our house. Lucy  completely calm  woke me up. “There’s a fire. I’ll get the kids  you put out the fire.” And so we did.  And then when our children were sick  the best cure was wrapped in mummy’s arms. “You’re thermal  mummy.” Daisy used to say as she snuggled in.   Lucy’s love for children has always gone beyond her own.   She was an early chairman of the Sydney Children’s Hospital Foundation and together we have sought to help those who help sick or disadvantaged kids.   We both believe that those of us who are well  with healthy families  should count our blessings and wherever we can  reach out to help those who are not so fortunate.   Mothers’ Day is a time to recommit as parents to teach our sons to respect their mothers and sisters.  Disrespecting women doesn’t always end in violence against women  but that is where all violence against women begins.  And now we have two more mothers in our family. Our daughter Daisy and husband James have Jack  almost three and full of all the energy and mischief of small boys. And she is expecting another child in September.   Our son Alex and his wife Yvonne have a daughter  Isla  who is nearly one. They live in Singapore  but yesterday we chatted on facetime as though they were here - little Isla reaching out to touch us on the screen.  Daisy with Jack  Yvonne with Isla - another generation of mothers in our family  young women filled with a love as ancient as it is pure  a love that is so natural  so human it connects all of us today and from the beginning of time.

Despite the years  despite some healing  the sense of loss still weighs heavily.  We will never be the same.  Standing against evil were countless acts of good  and tales of heroism—husbands dying protecting their wives; mothers dying protecting their children.   Those who risked their lives to warn others  who led people to safety  who did what they could to protect strangers.  At the funeral of Alannah and Madeline Mikac – aged just six and three – doves were released to signify that out of tragedy  we were united in our sincere desire that this kind of violence be prevented.    The Alannah & Madeline Foundation today continues its work to keep children safe from violence of any kind.  It will forever be a legacy of those who endured the massacre—those who died and those who survived—that gun violence in Australia is an exception rather than a brutal  regular reality.  We owe much to the leadership of John Howard for the tough gun laws that resulted and we are united with him when he says that we should be vigilant against any weakening of them today.

Anzac Day commemorates the triumph of the human spirit  the courage and resolve of those men and women who 100 years ago and ever since and today put their lives on the line to keep us safe  free and defend the values of democracy  freedom and the rule of law which we share and for which we stand.

He suffered a severe brain injury and his long and difficult recovery over four and a half years had many set backs - including the amputation of a leg.    Garry embodies the Anzac spirit - his courage and professionalism while on active duty and his courage and resilience and sheer guts as he worked to overcome his terrible injuries.    All throughout his long recovery  Garry said it was the love of his wife Katrina and their children and the memory of his fallen mates that gave him the strength to pull through.    Next month  he will be representing Australia in the Invictus Games  competing with other wounded veterans in events that most of us would struggle to keep up in.    Our freedoms  our  Australian way of life  have been hard won by generations of Australian servicemen and women who have put their lives on the line to keep Australia safe.

Kim is a social worker and Julian is a plumber.  They are a young couple with a baby girl and they have invested in real estate in order to get ahead.  They are like thousands of other Australians who negative gear - two thirds of whom have a taxable income of less than $80 000 a year.   Labor wants to eliminate negative gearing on existing residential property  commercial property  shares- in fact on every type of asset except a new dwelling.    This will reduce property values  it will increase rents and it will make it harder for people to get ahead.   And if that's not bad enough  Labor wants to increase  capital gains tax by 50 per cent which will mean less investment right across the board.   My Government wants more investment and more jobs. We will not change the negative gearing rules nor will we increase capital gains tax.   The enterprising spirit of Australians like the Mignaccas is what secures our economic future and the jobs of our children and grandchildren in the years ahead.   We will always back those people who back themselves  their business  and their family's future.

She is now campaigning against the tribunal that threatens the viability of tens of thousand of owner truck drivers across the country:  "Independence in running my own company is really important to me because I need to be able to do a variety of jobs for a variety of clients  I need to be able to financially quote for those jobs and be competitive " she said.    “The payments order is a two-edged sword.  On the east coast  the higher rates will send the smaller companies into bankruptcy with many already being told they no longer have a contract!  And on the west coast  it will mean that the hirer will be able to say  this is the base rate the Government has set.  So those of us who really need to charge more to cover our higher costs in the country will have to drop our rates.  We can’t afford to do that.   “I don’t believe the payments order system will make the roads safer because there’s no evidence that it will.  I support abolishing the RSRT.”

Pauline and Glen Kearney started a trucking business 20 years ago.  They own two trucks which they drive with their son Matt (their other son Jack hopes to join the business when he's old enough).

Because of a deal Bill Shorten made with the Transport Workers Union they are being forced out of business  along with tens of thousands of other truck owner drivers.  We back Pauline and Glen and the thousands of other owner drivers - small businessmen and women  family businesses. We will always back those Australians who have backed themselves and whose enterprise is securing our prosperity and the economic growth on which our future depends.

We want our children to have opportunities that perhaps we didn’t have.  The Close the Gap campaign is a grassroots movement has shaped  and will continue to shape  policy across governments.  Importantly  it will ensure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander babies born today live longer  are healthier and have more opportunities to live their full potential.  That is something that should fill us with optimism about our future.  We reflect on the gains we are making on Indigenous health and the challenges that still remain. The target to halve the gap in child mortality is on track.   The Indigenous infant mortality rate has more than halved over the past 16 years.   Between 2010 and 2013  the proportion of Indigenous mothers who attended antenatal care in the first trimester of pregnancy increased to 52 per cent. Rates were highest in very remote areas (59 per cent).   By the age of five a higher percentage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children are immunised compared with other Australian children.   While the life expectancy target is not on track to be met  some longer term improvements are evident.    For example  Indigenous mortality rates from circulatory diseases (such as heart disease and stroke) declined by 41 per cent between 1998 and 2013.   In the last decade  there has been a 7 percentage point decline in smoking rates for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged 15 years and over.  There is much more to be done.   But today  we say thank you to all those who work with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians and communities to improve the lives of our First Australians #closethegap

Tara's story reminds us that behind the headlines and statistics  the victims of domestic violence are real  they are beloved of their families and friends and their absence is mourned daily.  Government can provide leadership to fight domestic violence but we cannot do it alone. We are working with business and community organisations to deliver practical and immediate measures to keep women safe. Through our $100 million Women's Safety Package  we will provide $2.5 million to the Women's Services Network to distribute 20 000 Telstra safephones and provide training for frontline service providers. #togetherwearestrong

I have been loyal to Jeremy throughout his tenure as Leader. I resisted calls to speak out against him when he was running for the job and since he was elected. I have backed him 100%.  But my constituents and the country urgently need an effective  united Labour party to try and chart a progressive way forward for Britain after our exit from the European Union. We face grave economic risks and huge uncertainty. The situation has become untenable because the overwhelming majority of members of the Parliamentary party have lost confidence in him.  This is not ideological----the opposition to him is from all wings of the PLP. It is certainly not about a ‘Blairite’ wing of the party. I believe Jeremy’s views on austerity and inequality are important for the future of the party.   Nor is it unconstitutional---our constitution specifically provides for a Leader needing the support of the parliamentary party and the party in the country. The constitution says that if a Leader loses the support of 20% of the Parliamentary party and they nominate another candidate  there should be a fresh ballot. Jeremy has lost the support of more than 75% of the PLP.  I understand my position will upset some party members. Some who support Jeremy and some who fear this is a distraction from the crisis the country faces. To supporters of Jeremy  my candid view is that a progressive  Left agenda is more likely to be taken forward in a united Labour Party  not a wrecked  divided party. And to those who worry about distraction  we cannot function as an effective Opposition in the current circumstances.  Jeremy has had a profound and lasting influence on the debate about who we are as a party and the causes we need to fight for. I know he is someone who cares deeply about those causes  our party and our country. I hope he will reflect on how he can best serve this agenda at this critical moment for Britain and the Labour Party.  With best wishes  Ed Miliband

They are welcome  they are necessary  they are a vital part of our society  and I will passionately support this motion tonight.'

There was a rustling and twittering  as though of starlings assembling on a branch. Then I heard a collective clearing of the throat  and they started yodelling my name – followed by various expletives. “Oi Boris – c---!” they shouted. Or “Boris – w-----!” I looked out to see some otherwise charming-looking young people  the sort who might fast to raise money for a Third World leprosy project.  They had the air of idealists – Corbynistas; Lefties; people who might go on a march to stop a war. And so when they started on their protest song  I found myself a bit taken aback. “EU – we love YOU! EU – we love YOU!” they began to croon. Curious  I thought. What exactly is it about the EU that attracts the fervent admiration of north London radicals? It was the first time I had ever heard of trendy socialists demonstrating in favour of an unelected supranational bureaucracy.  In the old days  the Lefties used to dismiss the EU as a bankers’ ramp. Tony Benn thought it was unacceptably anti-democratic. Jeremy Corbyn used to vote against it in every division. Why has it suddenly become so fashionable among our nose-ringed friends? I tried to think which of the EU’s signature policies they were so keen on. Surely not the agricultural subsidies that make up most of the budget  and that have done so much to retard development in the Third World. They can’t – for heaven’s sake – support the peak tariffs that discriminate against value added goods from Sub-Saharan Africa. Nor can they possibly enjoy the sheer opacity of the system – the fact that there are 10 000 officials who are paid more than the Prime Minister  and whose names and functions we don’t know.  They can’t really be defending the waste  the fraud – or the endless expensive caravan of crémant-swilling members of the European Parliament between Brussels and Luxembourg and Strasbourg. Are they really demonstrating in favour of the torrent of red tape that has done so much to hold back growth in the EU? It seems an odd sort of campaign theme: what do we want? More Brussels law-making! When do we want it? Now!  Naturally  Lefties might want laws to protect the workforce – but they would surely want those laws to be made by politicians that the people could remove at elections. No: the more I thought about it  the odder it seemed. It was incredible that these young and idealistic people should be making a rumpus about the euro – the key policy of the modern EU – when that project has so gravely intensified suffering in many southern EU countries  and deprived a generation of young people of employment.  Perhaps  I mused  it was a general feeling that the EU was about openness  tolerance and diversity. But they must surely know that the EU’s rules on free movement mean a highly discriminatory regime  one that makes it much more difficult for people from outside the EU to get into Britain – even though we need their skills.  So what was it about? People’s emotions matter  even when they do not seem to be wholly rational. The feelings being manifested outside my house are shared by the large numbers of people – 30 000  they say – who at the weekend came together in Trafalgar Square to hear pro-EU speeches by Sir Bob Geldof. There is  among a section of the population  a kind of hysteria  a contagious mourning of the kind that I remember in 1997 after the death of the Princess of Wales. It is not about the EU  of course; or not solely. A great many of these protesters – like dear old Geldof – are in a state of some confusion about the EU and what it does.  It is not  as he says  a “free trade area”; if only it were. It is a vast and convoluted exercise in trying to create a federal union – a new political construction based in Brussels. But  as I say  I don’t believe that it is psychologically credible to imagine young people chanting hysterically in favour of Brussels bureaucrats. The whole protest is not about the EU project  per se; it is about them – their own fears and anxieties that are now being projected on to Brexit.  These fears are wildly overdone. The reality is that the stock market has not plunged  as some said it would – far from it. The FTSE is higher than when the vote took place. There has been no emergency budget  and nor will there be. But the crowds of young people are experiencing the last psychological tremors of Project Fear – perhaps the most thoroughgoing government attempt to manipulate public opinion since the run-up to the Iraq War.  When Geldof tells them that the older generation has “stolen your future” by voting to Leave the EU  I am afraid there are too many who still believe it. It is time for this nonsense to end. It was wrong of the Government to offer the public a binary choice on the EU without being willing – in the event that people voted Leave – to explain how this can be made to work in the interests of the UK and Europe. We cannot wait until mid-September  and a new PM. We need a clear statement  now  of some basic truths:  1. There is no risk whatever to the status of the EU nationals now resident and welcome in the UK  and indeed immigration will continue – but in a way that is controlled  thereby neutralising the extremists.  2. It is overwhelmingly in the economic interests of the other EU countries to do a free-trade deal  with zero tariffs and quotas  while we extricate ourselves from the EU law-making system.  3. We can do free-trade deals with economies round the world  many of which are already applying.  4. We can supply leadership in Europe on security and other matters  but at an intergovernmental level.  5. The future is very bright indeed. That’s what Geldof should be chanting.

Here's the text of a speech I delivered today ahead of the close of nominations for the leadership of the Conservative Party  an election I have decided not to contest:  Last week the people of this country voted to take a new path and a new direction for Britain in a decision that I passionately support  and it is vital now to see this moment for what it is   not as a time to quail  not as a crisis  not as an excuse for wobbling or self-doubt  but as a moment of hope and ambition for Britain  a time not to fight against the tide of history  but to take that tide at the flood and sail on to fortune  This is our chance  This is our chance to build a Britain not just with a dynamic free market economy  but an economy where everyone benefits from that success  because as someone who has campaigned across the country and spoken to thousands of people  I can tell you there are too many who have not seen their wages rise for years  and in many cases have seen them fall  and who cannot understand how it is that the pay packets of FTSE-100 chief executives are now 150 times the average of their companies  and I am no communist  and as my time at city hall shows I am a tax-cutting Conservative  but I want a capitalism that is fairer  to these forgotten people  where we invest in the potential of every young person so that they have the skills and the confidence to take advantage of what this country has to offer  This is our chance to learn the lessons of that referendum campaign  and as one nation conservatives to speak up for those forgotten people  to give them the ladder up which they can climb  and to draw them back into the great Conservative coalition to which they once belonged  This is our chance to restore Britain’s standing as an independent  sovereign and self-governing nation  making our own trade policy  striking deals with the growth economies of the world  and I can tell you that just in the last few days I have already heard of overtures from  Australia  New Zealand  India  Malaysia and Singapore  and the good news for the Americans is that they will be at the front of the queue  and of course it is our chance to relaunch our commitment to Europe  to peace and stability on the continent – by giving leadership on defence cooperation  and counter-terrorism  and intelligence-sharing  and all that makes our continent safer  This is our chance to assert our values  to tell the world again what kind of country Britain is  where we value everyone equally  no matter where you were born  or when you came to this country or what religion you practise you are part of our great British family  and we celebrate the contribution made by people who have come to this country to make it better and richer  whether it is quants in the city of London or anaesthetists in the NHS  a country where every person regardless of their sexuality can get married and find fulfilment  -      a freedom that must rank as one of the finest of David Cameron’s many fine achievements  This is our chance to unite our party around those values and at the same time to  unite our country  unite our society  and it is vital now to bring together everybody who campaigned so hard both for the remain and the leave sides  and I want to see the most talented and capable men and women in our party uniting to take our country forward  and when I think of the progress that I want Britain to make I cannot help think of how London has been transformed in the last few decades from relative stagnation to the most dynamic urban economy in Europe  I am immensely proud of what my team achieved at City Hall over the last 8 years  in which we did everything we could to break down the barriers that restrain the poorest in society  and to fuel the engines of social mobility  We brought down crime by almost 20 per cent  the murder rate down by half  bus crime down by 50 per cent  we cut deaths by fire by 50 per cent and brought down road traffic accidents to the lowest ever level  and when you think how crime and fire and road accidents disproportionately affect the poorest I believe you can see those reductions as a victory for social justice  We championed transport – the great equaliser and mobiliser  moving millions to take advantage of the greatest wealth-creating zone in the whole of Europe  and also liberating the development of hitherto inaccessible brownfield sites  so that we were able to build a record number of affordable homes  more than 100 000  to regenerate huge parts of east London   - go to the Olympic park and you will see the astonishing physical legacy from our games of 2012  and I am proud to say that when I left office last month there were 44 000 sites in this city under construction  more than at any time in the history of London  and we did everything we could to invest in our human capital  helping London’s superb schools and teaching with our excellence funds  creating more than 200k apprenticeships  and putting tens of millions of pounds into the pockets of the hardest-working families by championing the London Living Wage  and I am proud to say that not only is everyone living longer – 18 months for men and women  but the biggest gains in life expectancy have been made by those on the lowest incomes  When I became mayor London had 4 of the six poorest boroughs in the UK  there are now no London boroughs among the 20 most deprived in this country  it is time for us to invest in the infrastructure and to pursue the fiscal devolution agenda to ensure that London’s success is replicated – as it increasingly is – in the towns and cities across the UK  and I will not pretend that everything has always been rosy  Things are sometimes tough  even in the greatest city on earth  I have led our capital through riots and blizzards and strikes and terrorist attack  and every time we have bounced back and gone from strength to strength  I treasure the cover of Time Magazine from eight years ago  which had a picture of various famous London buildings being engulfed by the waves  London sinking  was the headline  Well  look at our capital today – still the number one financial centre   the greatest tech hub in this hemisphere  and the number one tourist destination on earth – with more people visiting the British Museum than the whole of Belgium  The prophets of doom were wrong then and they are wrong now  because London and the whole UK will flourish mightily outside the EU  since it is manifestly in the economic interests of our friends and partners to agree a deal  that involves mutual and universal access to our markets  with no tariffs and no quotas  while we remove ourselves from the EU legal order and the supremacy of the European Court  and take back control of our immigration policy with a points-based system that is fairer to all the talented people who want to come here  whether they are from the 7 per cent of the world that is in the EU or the 93 per cent who do not  because this is our chance to think globally again  to lift our eyes to the horizon  to bring our unique British voice and values – powerful  humane  progressive – to the great global forums without being elbowed aside by a supranational body  and instead of being afflicted by nerves let us seize this chance and make this our moment to stand tall in the world  That is the agenda for the next PM of this country  but I must tell you my friends – you who have faithfully waited for the punchline of this speech - that having consulted my colleagues I have concluded this person will not be me  my role will be to give every possible support to the next administration  to make sure that we properly fulfil the mandate of the people at the referendum  and to champion the agenda I believe in  to stick up for the forgotten people of this country  and so I believe that if we invest in our children and improve their life chances  if we continue to fuel the engines of social mobility  if we build on the great reforming legacy of David Cameron  if we invest in our infrastructure  and if we follow a sensible moderate one nation Conservative approach that is simultaneously tax-cutting and pro-enterprise  then I believe this country can be better and more wonderful and  yes  greater than ever  I want to thank my colleagues in parliament  my team and everyone who has supported our vision of a better Britain

Never in our history have so many people been asked to decide a big question about the nation’s future. Never have so many thought so deeply  or wrestled so hard with their consciences  in an effort to come up with the right answer.   It has been a gruelling campaign in which we have seen divisions between family and friends and colleagues – sometimes entirely amicable  sometimes  alas  less so. In the end  there was a clear result. More than 17 million people voted to leave the EU – more than have ever assented to any proposition in our democratic history. Some now cast doubt on their motives  or even on their understanding of what was at stake.   It is said that those who voted Leave were mainly driven by anxieties about immigration. I do not believe that is so. After meeting thousands of people in the course of the campaign  I can tell you that the number one issue was control – a sense that British democracy was being undermined by the EU system  and that we should restore to the people that vital power: to kick out their rulers at elections  and to choose new ones.   I believe that millions of people who voted Leave were also inspired by the belief that Britain is a great country  and that outside the job-destroying coils of EU bureaucracy we can survive and thrive as never before. I think that they are right in their analysis  and right in their choice. And yet we who agreed with this majority verdict must accept that it was not entirely overwhelming.   There were more than 16 million who wanted to remain. They are our neighbours  brothers and sisters who did what they passionately believe was right. In a democracy majorities may decide but everyone is of equal value.  We who are part of this narrow majority must do everything we can to reassure the Remainers. We must reach out  we must heal  we must build bridges – because it is clear that some have feelings of dismay  and of loss  and confusion.   I believe that this climate of apprehension is understandable  given what people were told during the campaign  but based on a profound misunderstanding about what has really taken place. At home and abroad  the negative consequences are being wildly overdone  and the upside is being ignored. The stock market is way above its level of last autumn; the pound remains higher than it was in 2013 and 2014.  The economy is in good hands. Most sensible people can see that Bank of England governor Mark Carney has done a superb job – and now that the referendum is over  he will be able to continue his work without being in the political firing-line. Thanks in large part to the reforms put in place by David Cameron and George Osborne  the fundamentals of the UK economy are outstandingly strong – a dynamic and outward-looking economy with an ever-improving skills base  and with a big lead in some of the key growth sectors of the 21st century.   We should be incredibly proud and positive about the UK  and what it can now achieve. And we will achieve those things together  with all four nations united. We had one Scotland referendum in 2014  and I do not detect any real appetite to have another one soon; and it goes without saying that we are much better together in forging a new and better relationship with the EU – based on free trade and partnership  rather than a federal system.   I cannot stress too much that Britain is part of Europe  and always will be. There will still be intense and intensifying European cooperation and partnership in a huge number of fields: the arts  the sciences  the universities  and on improving the environment. EU citizens living in this country will have their rights fully protected  and the same goes for British citizens living in the EU.   British people will still be able to go and work in the EU; to live; to travel; to study; to buy homes and to settle down. As the German equivalent of the CBI – the BDI – has very sensibly reminded us  there will continue to be free trade  and access to the single market. Britain is and always will be a great European power  offering top-table opinions and giving leadership on everything from foreign policy to defence to counter-terrorism and intelligence-sharing – all the things we need to do together to make our world safer.   The only change – and it will not come in any great rush – is that the UK will extricate itself from the EU’s extraordinary and opaque system of legislation: the vast and growing corpus of law enacted by a European Court of Justice from which there can be no appeal. This will bring not threats  but golden opportunities for this country – to pass laws and set taxes according to the needs of the UK.   Yes  the Government will be able to take back democratic control of immigration policy  with a balanced and humane points-based system to suit the needs of business and industry. Yes  there will be a substantial sum of money which we will no longer send to Brussels  but which could be used on priorities such as the NHS. Yes  we will be able to do free trade deals with the growth economies of the world in a way that is currently forbidden.   There is every cause for optimism; a Britain rebooted  reset  renewed and able to engage with the whole world. This was a seismic campaign whose lessons must be learnt by politicians at home and abroad. We heard the voices of millions of the forgotten people  who have seen no real increase in their incomes  while FTSE-100 chiefs now earn 150 times the average pay of their employees. We must pursue actively the one-nation policies that are among David Cameron’s fine legacy  such as his campaigns on the Living Wage and Life Chances. There is no doubt that many were speaking up for themselves.   But they were also speaking up for democracy  and the verdict of history will be that the British people got it right.

Here are a few pics from the final chunk of yesterday's visits across the country. From Wolverhampton I travelled up to Selby in Yorkshire (taking in the views of some beautiful countryside in the helicopter on the way)  before a swift pint with the troops in Darlington. All in all we covered off about 600 miles in one day.  And as this entire marathon campaign has come to a close  I look back and think of all the visits I have made  people I have met  conversations had  and stories heard. This is the most remarkable country on earth.   For me this campaign has been about democracy: who do we want to rule us.   It is we who want to give power back to people. It is we who want to stand up against the corporatist and elitist system that will never admit its mistakes. That is why we believe in democracy – because it is the best way humanity has found of correcting the errors of our rulers; and we would be crazy to throw it away.  Now is the time to believe in ourselves  and in what Britain can do  and to remember that we always do best when we believe in ourselves. Of course we can continue to provide leadership and support in Europe – but intergovernmentally  outside the supranational control of the EU system.  Today  I hope you will Vote Leave  and take back control of this country’s destiny; and if we Vote Leave  then all our votes will count for more in the future.  Let's make today our Independence Day.

Not that long ago I took part in my final debate. My sincere thanks go to the BBC for putting on such a vast and fantastic operation and obviously a huge thank you to the studio audience in Wembley and everyone at home for watching the discussion. I thoroughly enjoyed the chance to set out why I love this country and want us to Vote Leave. Here’s my closing statement - I hope you agree.

They say that whatever party they choose they get the same old broken promises. In fact  they say there is no point in bothering at all.  Well  whatever you say about this referendum campaign  it is a moment of fundamental decision. When you pick up your ballot paper this Thursday  you have it in your hands to transform Britain’s current democratic arrangements for the better. You can change the whole course of European history – and if you vote Leave  I believe that change will be overwhelmingly positive.  What is the Remain camp offering? Nothing. No change  no improvement  no reform; nothing but the steady and miserable erosion of parliamentary democracy in this country. If we vote Remain  we stay locked in the back of the car  driven by someone with an imperfect command of English  and going a direction we don’t want to go.  If Britain votes to Remain in the EU  then we continue to be subject to an increasingly anti-democratic system that is now responsible for 60 per cent of the law that goes through Westminster – a phenomenon that contributes so powerfully to the modern voter’s apathy  the sensation that we no longer control our destiny  and that voting changes nothing.  If we vote Remain  we do nothing to rebuke the elites in Brussels who have imposed the euro on the continent  and thrown a generation of young people on the scrap-heap  and who are utterly indifferent to the misery they are causing for the sake of their bankrupt ideology.  We will remain prisoners of a trade regime that will not allow this country – the fifth biggest economy on earth – to negotiate with America  or China or India or any of the other growth economies of the world; because that privilege is reserved exclusively for the hierarchs of the European Commission  of whose vast staff only 3.6 per cent come from this country.  If we stay  we will find our global influence and weight not enhanced  but diminished – as the EU ruthlessly cuckoos us aside from our seat on international bodies  from the IMF and the UN and the WTO to even the North East Atlantic Fisheries Management Board  which determines the fate of the fish in so much of UK waters. Iceland has a seat; Norway has a seat; the Faroe islands have a seat. The UK is represented by the Commission.  We are not more powerful  or more influential for being around the table in Brussels – look at the pitiful results of the so-called renegotiation earlier this year. We are drowned out. And it is an illusion to think that if we vote to Remain  we are somehow opting for the status quo. The status quo is not on offer. If we stay in  we will be engaged willy-nilly in the desperate attempt to keep the euro together  by building an economic government of Europe.  We have already seen how we can be forced to bail out the debtor nations; and we have seen – in the absence of border controls – how the despair in southern Europe contributes to the substantial flows of migration  which show no sign of diminishing. If we vote to stay then I am afraid the whole EU caravan carries blithely on; and when I think of the champagne – guzzling orgy of backslapping in Brussels that would follow a Remain vote on Friday  I want to weep. We must not let it happen.  Think of what we can achieve if we vote Leave. We can take back control of huge sums of money – £10.6 billion net per year – and spend it on our priorities. We can take back control of our borders  and install an Australian-style points-based system that is fair both to people coming from the EU and from non-EU countries.  We can do global trade deals that the EU commission itself believes could generate another 300 000 jobs. Above all we could take back control of our powers to pass laws and set tax rates in the interest of the UK economy. We can reorientate the UK economy to the whole world  rather than confining ourselves to an EU that now amounts to only 15 per cent of global GDP.  Why shouldn’t we do this? When in the history of this country have we gone wrong by believing in self-government? As this campaign has gone on  the Remain campaign has become more and more hysterical in its threats and warnings  to the point where very few people now believe in them. The IMF? Why on earth should the Treasury expect us to believe the IMF – when it was only a couple of years ago that the Treasury was bitterly (and correctly) denouncing the IMF for running Britain down.  People can sense the true motives behind Project Fear. It isn’t idealism  or internationalism. It’s a cushy elite of politicians and lobbyists and bureaucrats  circling the wagons and protecting their vested interests.  Finally the Remainers are now desperately trying to suggest that anyone who wants to Leave is somehow against the spirit of modern Britain; against openness  tolerance  decency. What nonsense – and what an insult to the people of all races and parties and ages and beliefs who simply want to take back control of this country’s democracy.  It is we who want to give power back to people. It is we who want to stand up against the corporatist and elitist system that will never admit its mistakes. That is why we believe in democracy – because it is the best way humanity has found of correcting the errors of our rulers; and we are mad to throw it away.  Now is the time to believe in ourselves  and in what Britain can do  and to remember that we always do best when we believe in ourselves. Of course we can continue to provide leadership and support for Europe – but intergovernmentally  outside the supranational EU system.  I hope you will vote Leave  and take back control of this great country’s destiny; and if we Vote Leave  then all our votes will count for more in the future. This chance will not come again in our lifetimes  and I pray we do not miss it.

It is clear from their style of debate in the last few weeks that the Remain campaign is conscious that it is losing the argument  and losing comprehensively. To many fair-minded people – including those who had not previously given the matter much thought – it now seems obvious that the UK should leave the European Union.  Whatever the noble ambitions on which it was founded  the EU is an anachronism. It is increasingly anti-democratic; its supranational system is being imitated nowhere else on earth; and its economic policies are causing misery in many parts of the EU. It is sclerotic  opaque  elitist: different nations bound together by a centralised bureaucracy that ordinary people can neither understand nor vote out. It is an attempt to build a United States of Europe; to create a single political structure. And yet no senior Remainer has so far had the honesty to defend the project for what it is. No one on the Remain side has shown any shred of explicit federalist idealism; no one has called for Britain to join in “building Europe” or in creating a “European identity”. That is because they know that this ideology – though dominant in Brussels – would be viewed with alarm by the British public.  So what do we get  instead of idealism? We get an unending and intensifying diet of fear. We are being bullied and brow-beaten into remaining in this failing system – and I think the public can see through it. As time goes on  I find more and more people can see that Britain would have a great future outside the EU – trading freely with the EU and the rest of the world  while engaging fully at an intergovernmental level with all the political and diplomatic questions in Europe. On every major question it is possible to take back control – and thrive.  Whether you express the figure as £350 million a week gross or £10.6 billion a year net  most people are amazed to discover how much we pay just to be in the EU. We could do with having that cash back. They can see that our current immigration policy is unfair and unbalanced and out of control – and they can also see that the Remain campaign has failed for months to answer the fundamental question. How can we control the rate – 333 000 net last year  a city the size of Newcastle – as long as we are in the EU?  The Remainers have nothing to say. Their mouths just open and shut  wordlessly. Above all  people are rumbling the great big fat lie at the heart of the whole thing: that the sacrifice of democracy – the 2 500 new EU laws imposed on us every year  costing £600 million a week for business – is somehow worth it for the economic benefits of the so-called single market.  In the last week we have had amazing testimonials from two of the biggest heroes of modern British manufacturing. I was thrilled when they spoke out  because I know the kind of pressure that all UK business leaders are facing from Project Fear. In their optimism  their vigour and their belief in this country  they sum up what the Leave campaign is all about. They are (Lord) Anthony Bamford  of the mighty digger firm JCB  and James Dyson the billionaire entrepreneur and inventor.  Now these people make machines: beautiful  complex  cutting-edge bits of technology. You might have thought that it was precisely for them – and their kind – that the “single market” was invented  so that their vacuum cleaners and backhoe loaders can circulate freely across the 510-million strong territory. You might have imagined that they would be passionate advocates of the system.  On the contrary – they both export colossal quantities to EU markets  and will continue to do so; but they both think we should get out of the EU  and that the whole thing is going in the wrong direction. Dyson is the No 1 brand leader in the German vacuum-cleaner market. Does he worry about tariffs  if we left? Of course not. The Germans would not dream of it: we Brits buy 820 000 German cars every year  worth about 20 billion euros. In fact we buy one fifth of Germany’s entire car output. As Dyson points out  tariffs would mean the Germans would be cutting their own throats. It won’t happen.  He wants to take back control of our law-making system  because he is fed up with the Brussels stitch-up  by which British ministers can be outvoted to the detriment of his company. And he wants to take back control of immigration – not because he is in any way hostile to immigrants. He is just infuriated by the imbalance in the system. There is no limit on EU migrants  but he has no way of hiring enough postgraduate engineers  because most people doing research in science and engineering at British universities are from outside the EU.  As for Lord Bamford  he has seen that the “single market” is in reality a political project that is turning inexorably into a single government of Europe. There is no need to be part of this expensive legislative machine in order to export goods or services into the EU. The latest figures show that between 1993 (the dawn of the single market) and 2015 there were 36 countries – including India  Russia  China  America  New Zealand  Canada  Brazil – who did better than the UK at exporting to the single market. They weren’t “in” it. They didn’t have Brussels making 60 per cent of their laws. And yet they did better than us.  It is time for this country to show some of the self-belief of these two great companies. It was only a few months ago that the Prime Minister was saying we would thrive mightily outside. He was right first time. As James Dyson says: “We will create more wealth and more jobs by being outside the EU. We will be in control of our destiny. And control  I think  is the most important thing in life and business.”

You wake up with a vague but intensifying sense of guilt  and wonder why you have fallen asleep on the sofa. There are half-drunk beer cans lying around  crisp packets. The TV is burbling to itself in the corner of the room  and you know that in a second you are going to remember that something big has happened  and that you aren’t going to like it – and then it hits you: the Referendum! That’s right.  Yesterday morning you were on the verge of voting to Leave the EU. You were all psyched up. You could see that the case was unanswerable – that we were being asked to remain in an EU that was unabashed  unrepentant  undemocratic and  above all  unreformed. You knew that this was the last – the only – chance you would have in your life to vote for change  and to make the powerful listen. This was the moment for Britain to speak for all the people of Europe – everyone enraged with how Brussels works.  You began that Thursday determined to protest against the whole stitch-up: the way the European Commission conspires with big business to regulate out the competition; the lobbyists  the fat cats  the people who were responsible for the VW diesel emissions scandal; and all the billions of pounds of fraud and waste of the EU budget.  This was the moment to stand up for the dispossessed of southern Europe  their lives blighted by the euro. This was the chance to fight for the low-paid in the UK  their incomes compressed – according to the Bank of England itself – by the uncontrolled immigration that is a function of EU membership and the euro crisis.  Now  and now only  was the time to call a halt to the endless erosion of democracy. This was the day when you had resolved to give back to the British people their sovereign right to sack – at elections – the people who make the big political decisions. Yes  you were going to take back control.  You were going to give our government – the British government – the power to control our immigration policy  with a points-based system to serve the real needs of the UK economy. You were going to take back control of at least £10 billion a year of taxpayers’ money that goes to Brussels and that we never see again  which could be spent on the NHS or schools  or whatever priority the government chooses.  You were set to reclaim control of our national security – and stop the European Court of Justice intervening in Home Office attempts to deport terrorist suspects. You were going to take back control of taxation  so that this government could – if it chose – cut fuel bills for the elderly  or motoring costs  or the price of tampons. You were going to allow this country to set its own destiny  with a dynamic series of free-trade deals of the kind that have been impossible while the UK has been in the EU. You had decided once and for all to end the madness by which 60 per cent of the law made in Westminster is generated  one way or another  by the EU.  You were about to strike your own small but vital blow for freedom and democracy – when you suddenly bottled it. You swerved; you shied; you jibbed; you baulked. You screwed up your eyes in the polling booth and you found yourself momentarily oppressed by the sheer weight of the Remain propaganda – all that relentless misery about this country and its inability to stand on its own two feet.  For reasons you secretly know were nonsensical  you decided to go for what the gloom-mongers had told you was the safer option. Nose held  eyes screwed tight  you voted for Remain. And now you understand why you feel that sense of morning-after shame and abject remorse: because the burble from the TV is informing you that Remain have won. Yes  by the narrowest margin you – and fellow last-minute swervers – have helped to keep us locked in the back of the minicab  with a driver who barely speaks English  going in a direction we don’t want to go.  Now the TV is going to Brussels  where an exultant Jean-Claude Juncker  the Commission president  is hailing the wisdom of the British people. “The British question is solved!” he announces over what looks very like a glass of champagne.  Assorted Europhiles are on the airwaves – Peter Mandelson and Tory ex-Cabinet ministers – proclaiming that the next step is UK membership of the euro. People are already talking about the plan to create a true “political union” with common EU rules on company law  property taxes  and many other areas of policy in which Britain will have no choice but to comply.  Brussels correspondents are reporting on all the plans that the Commission has been sitting on to avoid frightening the horses during the UK referendum. There is the directive that will seriously damage the UK art market; there is the famous directive on the power of vacuum cleaners and toasters; and dozens of others  none of which we can veto. It now seems – hey presto – that Britain’s budgetary contributions will go up  to more even than £350 million per week. There are plans for a European army  it emerges  that will undermine Nato.  You put your head in your hands – because you realise you have given the green light to a continuing and intensifying disaster: attempts to preserve the euro by creating a United States of Europe – a territory where people will have no choice but to flee the less competitive zones  with ever-growing numbers coming to Britain  from EU countries where the average wage is a fraction of our living wage.  A nightmare  yes? So don’t let it happen. Believe in Britain  and our ability as a proud  self-confident  and independent country to help restore democracy here and around the whole continent. Vote Leave on June 23.

Rightly the focus was on farming and I set out why when we Vote Leave we will continue to support and invest in this industry whilst liberating it from burdensome EU red tape.   Farming always has and always will play a huge part in the British economy and way of life  and it is right that all governments support this vital sector. No government would be mad enough not to support our farmers.    And here's the crucial point - given the massive strains on the Brussels budgets  given the crisis in the Euro  given the economic disaster that's taking place in some parts of the EU  how can people be sure that the farming budgets from Brussels are actually going to be protected  and that's the question I'd put back to the Remain camp

Let’s look at the real economic impact of the European Union on Britain and Europe.  We can dismiss most of the claims for the “single market” – too often an excuse for a morass of politically driven legislation that costs UK business about £600 million a week. In the 20 years since the dawn of the 1992 Single Market programme  there were many countries that did far better than the UK at exporting to the EU; 27 non-EU countries did better at increasing their exports of goods  and 21 did better at ramping up their exports of services. Of course they did: American and other non-EU businesses have excellent “access” to the EU  but aren’t wrapped in EU red tape  whereas we have only 6 per cent of companies trading with the rest of the EU – yet 100 per cent of them have to comply with EU law.  And is the EU booming  thanks to the “single market”? Of course not. Since 2008 the US has seen gross domestic product go up by about 13 per cent; the EU’s has gone up by 3 per cent. The EU is a graveyard of low growth; the only continent with lower growth is currently Antarctica. That is partly because of the sclerotic one-size-fits-all Brussels approach to regulation; but  worse  in the last decade the EU has been suffering from a self-inflicted economic disaster – the euro.  We get inured to some of the figures – the 50 per cent youth unemployment in Greece and Spain – without stopping to think of the individual tragedies; the suicide rates; the inability to get medical treatments; the blighting of young lives. It is a moral outrage; and the search for a safety valve is continuous.  On our doorstep we have a vast and developing tragedy – caused by the folly of trying to impose a single currency on an area with different labour markets and different rates of productivity. Take away their ability to devalue – with their own independent currencies – and many parts of the EU have found it impossible to compete.  What can they do? There are broadly three responses. The first is for the battered southern Mediterranean states to obey the diktat of the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. They can cut costs. They can punish workers. They can cut pensions and holidays and benefits and hope that they can somehow bring their unit labour costs in line with Germany. The resulting austerity has taken a vicious toll  demand has fallen  confidence is shot to hell  and the suffering continues. The riots have now spread to France.  Alternatively  they can be treated as the poor and backward parts of a single political unit – like the south of the US  or the Mezzogiorno of Italy. They can beg for cash subsidies to keep them going.  The trouble with this approach is that it requires the German taxpayer to be extremely generous to non-Germans – and as the programme develops  the Germans are inevitably demanding restraint on the fiscal policies of their clients  since he who pays the piper calls the tune. That is why the next step – post the UK referendum – is to try full-bore to create an “economic government of Europe”  using the single-market institutions  in a way that will inevitably drag us in – and for which the UK taxpayer will end up paying. This “political union” will be both horrifically anti-democratic and expensive; for us  too.  Then  of course  there is a third way in which people can respond to the disaster of being locked in a suboptimal currency zone  when their own region is unable to compete. They can simply move. That is what is happening now – on a scale never seen before in our lives. People are leaving the areas of Europe that are being hit by the euro crisis  and they are moving in search of work – above all to Britain. Last week we saw some astonishing figures: 270 000 immigrants from the EU – and 184 000 net. That is the same as a city the size of Oxford. We are in the throes of the fastest demographic change for 1 000 years.  I have always championed the benefits of immigration  and the ability of talented people from around the world to contribute to the life of this country. But how can anyone claim that this is not an economic phenomenon? Immigration is now the single biggest driver of our population – set to soar to 70 or 80 million. It is this surge in demand that is largely causing the housing crisis  and the almost overwhelming pressure to destroy the green belt. It is immigration that has been relentlessly helping to compress the wages of the low-paid while the FTSE-100 chiefs (many lobbying for Remain) have seen their pay go up to 150 times that of their average worker.  Priti Patel was absolutely right to point out yesterday that such executives – nice and well-meaning though they may be – are insulated from the impacts of these inflows on GP surgeries and school places. And the flows will get much  much bigger as the new Living Wage takes effect. The UK minimum wage is already the equivalent of €1 529 a month – compared with €215 in Bulgaria and €233 in Romania. Think of that magnetic effect – if we continue  as now  with no way of moderating the tide.  There may be a case to be made for this influx. Perhaps the public could be persuaded. But that is emphatically not what the Government has chosen to do. Year after year we have been told that immigration can be cut to the “tens of thousands” – a claim that now looks demonstrably hollow as long as we are in the EU.  People do not necessarily object to immigration  and certainly not to the immigrants themselves. They object to the absence of democratic consent. There is no balance or discretion in the policy  because we do not control it – and the only way to take back control is to vote Leave on June 23.

It is the number of times the salary of the average FTSE100 top executive exceeds that of the average – the average – employee in that company. This multiple appears to be taking off  at an extraordinary  inexplicable and frankly nostril-wrinkling rate.   Plato said no one should earn more than five times anyone else. Well  Plato would have been amazed by the growth in corporate inequality today. In 1980 the multiple was 25. By 1998 it had risen to 47. After 10 years of Tony Blair and Peter Mandelson – and their “intensely relaxed” attitude to getting “filthy rich” – the top executives of big UK firms were earning 120 times the average pay of the shop floor. Last year it was 130 times.   This year – cue a fusillade of champagne corks – the fat cats have broken through the magic 150 barrier. The average FTSE100 CEO is taking home 150 times as much as his or her average employee – and in some cases far more. Let us make no bones about it: these people have so much more money than other people in the same company that they are flying in private jets and building subterranean swimming pools  while many of their employees cannot afford to buy any kind of home at all. There is one gentleman out there who is on 810 times the average of his employees.   What is going on? Is it just greed  or mutual back-scratching of the remuneration committees? No doubt they will tell us  as ever  that this is the “going rate in the market”. But I notice one other point about these FTSE100 men (and I am afraid they are almost always men): that they are only too happy to parade through Downing Street and declare their undying devotion to the EU. They happily sign letters to the papers  explaining how vital it is that we Remain. They must think that the EU is good for their business.   But how  exactly? The Single Market is a microcosm of low growth. It is blighted by chronically high unemployment. The EU countries have been outperformed for growth by the rest of the OECD countries; and it is a stunning fact that there are 27 non-EU countries that enjoyed faster growth in exporting goods to the EU than Britain  since the start of the Single Market in 1992  and 20 that have done better at exporting services. Membership is far from conspicuously brilliant for UK Plc.   So what is it these fat cats like about the EU? Broadly two things. They like uncontrolled immigration  because it helps to keep wages down at the bottom end and so to control costs  and therefore to ensure that there is even more dosh for those at the top. A steady supply of hard-working immigrant labour means they don’t have to worry quite so much about the skills or aspirations or self-confidence of young people growing up in this country. And as denizens of Learjets and executive lounges  they are not usually exposed to some of the pressures of large-scale immigration  such as in A&E  or schools  or housing.   Then there is a more insidious reason – that the whole EU system of regulation is so remote and opaque that they are able to use it to their advantage  to maintain their oligarchic position and  by keeping out competition  to push their pay packets even higher.   In their brilliant book Why Nations Fail  Daron Acemoglu and James A Robinson explain how transparent political institutions are essential for innovation and economic growth. They make the distinction between “inclusive” societies  where people feel involved in their democracies and their economies  and “extractive” societies  where the system is increasingly gamed by an elite  for their own financial advantage. The EU is starting to take on some of the features of an “extractive” society. It is dominated by a group of powerful international civil servants  lobbyists and business people.  These people  on the whole  know who each other are. In the case of big business  they can afford to hire someone to follow the regulation that comes out of Brussels. They can fix a meeting with the Commissioner responsible. They may even meet him or her at some conference or event – Davos being the most famous. In that respect they have an immense advantage over the vast majority of businesses in this country.   Most businesses (in fact most Britons) have absolutely no idea who works in the Commission  or how to get in touch with them  and they wouldn’t know their Euro-MP from the man in the moon. Only 6 per cent of UK businesses actually export to the EU  and yet 100 per cent of them have to comply with 100 per cent of EU law  whether they are large businesses or small – a regulatory burden that costs about £600 million per week.   Last week I visited Reid Steel  a British success story in Christchurch  Dorset. They export steel for bridges in Sudan  hotels in Mauritius  aircraft hangars in Mongolia. The only thing that was holding them back  they said  was EU regulation – generated by an inscrutable process involving fat cat lobbyists and fat cat businesses and the governments of other countries. They are desperate to get out of the EU  and they are right. They believe the other EU countries would rapidly do a free trade deal  and an unshackled British business sector would probably export more to the rest of Europe than it does today.   Of course  the FTSE100 fat cats will sign up for remaining in the EU: they are getting personally richer and richer – by mainlining immigrant labour for their firms and manipulating EU regulation that only the big players can understand – while those at the bottom have seen a real terms fall in their wages. It is one of the reasons that the EU has such low innovation  low productivity  and low growth. If you want to back the entrepreneurs  the grafters  the workers  the innovators  the burgeoning and dynamic businesses of Britain – then Vote Leave on June 23  and give this cabal the kick in the pants they deserve.

I have repeatedly condemned Vladimir Putin's actions in the Ukraine.  As it happens I didn't even discuss the issue of the Russian leader this morning. I merely said what is relatively uncontroversial - that the EU handling of Ukraine was very far from ideal.  It is absolutely contemptible to call me an apologist for Putin.  The Remain campaign are clutching pathetically at straws and they should themselves apologise.  They having nothing positive to say about Britain's future. Jack Straw is tacitly admitting what we all know - that the deal delivered absolutely no change in Britain's relations with the EU.   These are the hard truths. And they are trying to disguise them by their usual confection of distortion and untruth.  These are the questions that the Remainers need to answer:  1. How can you possibly control EU immigration into this country?  2. The Living Wage is an excellent policy  but how will you stop it being a big pull factor for uncontrolled EU migration  given that it is far higher than minimum wages in other EU countries?  3. How will you prevent the European Court from interfering further in immigration  asylum  human rights  and all kinds of matters which have nothing to do with the so-called Single Market?  4. Why did you give up the UK veto on further moves towards a fiscal and political union?  5. How can you stop us from being dragged in  and from being made to pay?  ... And won't and can't.

I have also been in touch with Zac and thanked him for his heroic efforts to carry the Conservative banner in our city  in spite of the strong headwinds he faced at this stage in the political cycle.  I believe the high turn out is proof once again that the London mayoralty is now firmly established in the public mind  and I have no doubt the incoming mayor will be able to use the growing powers of the job to deliver improvements in the lives of Londoners.

It's been huge honour and privilege to serve as Mayor for the last 8 years.

People keep asking me whether I am sad to be stepping down  after eight years  as Mayor of the greatest city on earth. Will I shed a tear? they ask. Will I blub into my last fair trade goat curry in the City Hall canteen? And the answer is  of course  I am sad – and immensely proud of all that has been achieved in London. But I have been around long enough to know that the punters  frankly  could not give a monkey’s.  They are interested – rightly – in what comes next. Their eyes are on the future. They want to know whether the next mayor will do a good job for them; and so in the last four days  before I am finally prised from my swivel chair on the eighth floor  I want to give some advice to the people. It concerns their choice on Thursday.  The other day  LBC radio took me up in a helicopter  and I was stunned at the changes that have taken place. Eight years ago the cover of Time had a picture of London sinking beneath the waves – and the thrust of the piece was that London was finished. We had been banjaxed by the financial crisis  the US news magazine argued. Money and power were haemorrhaging to the east. It was all Shanghai  Mumbai  Dubai and bye-bye London.  Well  whoever wrote that piece – and he was not alone in his analysis – should have been in the chopper last week. The growth is stunning  and it is in every quadrant of the city. From Battersea to Greenwich to the Olympic Park to Old Oak common  London is now seething with the biggest programme of regeneration the city has ever seen. Brownfield sites – derelict wastelands that have been untouched for decades – are turning into fantastic places to live. London is now by far the most dynamic urban economy in Europe  leading the world in tech  media  arts  culture  finance  bio-science  universities – and we still manufacture everything from bikes to chocolate cake.  Four years after the Olympics  we are the number one tourist destination in the world. Unemployment has fallen; incomes have risen; the London Living Wage has massively expanded. Everyone wants to come here – and  if possible  to live here. And that is the problem. Since I have been Mayor  the population has boomed – by well over 600 000. We have to build new housing; faster  better  cheaper. Yes  my team in City Hall can be very proud of building well over 100 000 affordable homes (far more than were ever achieved in Labour’s eight years). But we need more – and in a city that is 607 square miles  that means joining up the brownfield housing sites with the zones of economic activity; and that means investing in public transport.  That is why I am so alarmed by the policies of the Labour candidate  Sadiq Khan. Never mind the nauseating drivel about Hitler from the former mayor  Ken Livingstone. Set on one side  for a moment  the Labour Party’s current problem with anti-Semitism. What worries me is the return of another aspect of Livingstone-ism; and that is an irresponsible and unaffordable approach to the funding of the city.  At the heart of Sadiq Khan’s pitch is a piece of classic Ken-ery. He wants to hold transport fares down so low that he would take £2 billion out of the budgets for London transport. This is a huge mistake. It will mean delaying or cancelling infrastructure projects that are desperately needed; and that means your bus not turning up; your Tube delayed; your nose thrust into someone else’s armpit. But it is also a tragic failure to understand the reality of London’s position  in an age of budgetary restraint.  It is true that we have seen record investment in the city – but that is because London government has persuaded the Treasury of our seriousness in cutting waste. We have folded organisations together; we have massively reduced headcount; we have radically reformed the estate to take account of technological change – closing 12 fire stations  70 police stations and 263 Tube ticket offices. We have transformed TfL’s finances  so that by 2020 it will not need any revenue funding at all. It is because we have taken these tough decisions that the Treasury has been willing to support the city  and to defy all those who say London is unfairly favoured.  Crossrail 2 will now go ahead  as well as new river crossings; and City Hall has been given big new powers over suburban rail  over health  over planning and over skills. But that is because at every stage we have been ruthlessly cost-cutting – slicing our share of the council tax by 27 per cent  for instance. With the deficit the size it is  there is just no way the Treasury will write cheques to London if the city is run by a mayor so profligate and reckless that he decides to burn £2 billion.  It will turn into a war between City Hall and Whitehall – of the kind that Ken Livingstone used to love in the 1980s – and it will be a fiasco. When I came to City Hall eight years ago  I turfed out a load of semi-Marxists who luxuriated in taxpayer-funded Châteauneuf-du-Pape while specialising in the kind of Lefty grievance politics that divide the city. Whatever Khan may now say  that gang will come back with a Labour victory.  If Labour wins on Thursday  I confidently prophesy that Livingstone will be back in City Hall within a week. Zac Goldsmith is the only man who can stop it happening. He is a sensible  moderate one-nation Tory who will keep council tax low  protect the look and feel of outer London  keep crime coming down and keep the capital moving in the right direction. He has superb and innovative policies on housing and the environment; and in addition to pursuing all the good policies of the outgoing mayor he is younger  taller and let’s face it  much better-looking. He will make a great mayor. Let’s back Zac and crack on with the renaissance of the greatest city on earth.

Back in 2008  after the crash  people said London was finished. But  after my 8 years as Mayor  London has bounced back with fantastic energy.  All of that is at risk from Jeremy Corbyn's candidate for Mayor  Sadiq Khan.  So if you think that London has been going in broadly the right direction  if you think that our city still has got further to go  then I hope very much that you’ll support Zac Goldsmith on 5th May and make Greater London greater still.

They think that we have just seen the turning point in the referendum campaign  and that the British people are so intimidated by these testimonials – American presidents  business leaders  fat cats of every description – that they now believe the British people will file meekly to the polls in two months time and consent to stay in the EU; and thereby to the slow and insidious erosion of democracy in this country.   If that is indeed the view of the Remain campaign  they are crowing too soon. They are perhaps ignoring the resilience and thoughtfulness of many middle-of-the-roaders. One senior public servant – a man of no political party  and who had previously been on the fence – texted me after the US intervention and said he had been so outraged at President Obama’s “back of the queue” remark that he had instantly decided to vote Leave.   But let us suppose that the Bremainers are right in their complacency. Let’s imagine that we all wake up on June 24  and discover that the people have indeed been so cowed and so perplexed by the scare stories that they voted to Remain. What then? There will be instant jubilation in Brussels  of course; champagne corks going off like Tchaikovsky’s 1812 overture. Among the vast clerisy of lobbyists and corporate affairs gurus – all the thousands of Davos men and women who have their jaws firmly clamped around the euro-teat – there will be relief. Things will go on as they are; indeed  things will go into overdrive.   For more than a year now  Brussels has been in a self-imposed lockdown. Nothing must be done to frighten the children. The British referendum – that embarrassing and tedious genuflection to democracy – must be safely won; and then they will get their plans out of the drawer and get on with the business of building a federal superstate.   You may have noticed  however  that the euro crisis is far from over  and that the EU remains a gigantic engine of job destruction. Eight years after the disaster began  it is obvious that the problem is structural  not cyclical. In Spain  Portugal and Greece  a whole generation of young people has been sacrificed to the Moloch of the euro – and they are still on the dole. The Greeks are unable to pay their debts; the Italian banks have a €360 billion black hole.   In response  the EU plans “more Europe”  a fiscal and political union  in which Britain would inevitably be involved.  Remember we were told we wouldn’t have to pay for the Greek bail-outs? And then we did? According to the European Commission’s Five Presidents’ Report  which lays out plans to shore up the euro  the Commission wants to have a new European approach to company law  to property rights  to every aspect of employment law. Why? Because if the Germans are to be persuaded to engage in a perpetual bankrolling of the less prosperous regions of the EU  then they want proper Germanic rules to enforce good behaviour. He who pays the piper calls the tune. And Brussels can see only one way to save the euro – and that is to get Germany to pay  and therefore to allow Germany to call the tune.   Remember that twice in the last five years  the EU has removed a democratically elected government – in Italy and Greece – and installed Brussels-approved technocrats. It is a narcotic tyranny. They want to go on with the work of building a unitary state  in a way that is anti-democratic and ultimately very dangerous  since it will one day provoke real public anger.  Britain should not be involved in any of this – and yet we have absurdly and inexcusably given up our veto rights; and the whole process is going to be conducted within the “single market” – that is  the existing EU structures – so that we are morally and legally comprised  and share all the ensuing political and economic damage.   Inch by inch  month by month  the sausage machine of EU law-making will extrude more laws – at a rate of 2 500 a year  or perhaps even faster  once the referendum is out of the way. More and more people will exercise their unfettered rights to come to this country  putting more pressure on our public services. And eventually – when we are unable to take it any more – the UK will utter a faint sheepish cough of protest. Please sir  we will say  raising our hand in the EU Council  we need reform. And eyebrows will shoot up in a Batemanesque way. REFORM? they will say  in the tones of Lady Bracknell. REFORM? But you just had reform…   If there is one thing that proves the folly of remaining in the EU – in the hope that we can change things from within – it is the tragic poverty of that deal. The Prime Minister asked to restore social and employment legislation to national control; for a complete opt-out from the Charter of Fundamental rights; to stop the European court adjudicating on UK criminal law; to ensure that immigrants have a job offer before entering the UK; to revise the Working Time directive to protect the NHS; to reform the Common Agricultural Policy and the structural funds; and full-on Treaty change. What did we get? Two thirds of diddly squat.   We need to talk about that deal in the weeks ahead  because it shows how contemptuously we will be treated if we vote to remain. This is the last chance  in our lifetimes  to take back control – of £350m a week (and use some of that cash to deliver a seven-day NHS) – and the last chance to take back control of our democracy.   Of course the elites want to remain. They will always have power. The losers are the hundreds of millions of Europeans whose only power is their vote – their ability to sack their governments at elections. That power is being taken away. It is indefensible  and it will lead to real trouble. We can be stronger  richer  more influential if we vote Leave. In believing that we can all be scared into thinking otherwise  the Remainers are fatally underestimating the British public.

And if that is true it is highly appropriate that he should be our national Saint - a heroic and independent small business man of the kind that still today forms the backbone of the English economy. Above all he was a man who had the guts to stand up to the prevailing consensus of the establishment. You will recall that for decades the people had been oppressed by an alien tyrant  a dragon that ate people and took 20 billion pounds a year and did terrible economic damage. The elites all collaborated in the disaster. They said that there was no other option. They deplored the dragon but they said that getting rid of it was too risky. Stuff that said St George. He slew the dragon  liberated the people and restored democracy. And he got the princess.   Cry God for England and St George today!

I am not for one minute prepared to exclude the possibility that erotic interest may flower between a man and a goat. The ancient Greeks clearly thought about the possibility: hence their mythologising about Pan and satyrs and other cloven-footed hybrids.   A cursory trawl of the internet reveals – according to the BBC – that in 2006 a Sudanese man called Tombe was surprised in the act of darkness with a female goat  and was obliged by the village elders to pay a dowry of 15 000 Sudanese dinars to its owner  and then to marry the beast. To the best of my knowledge they are still together.   But I don’t think there is anyone of any importance who seriously believes that there has been any kind of romance involving the President of Turkey  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  and any other non-human mammal  caprine or otherwise.   So  when a young German comedian called the Turkish leader a “goat –––––––”  in a little-watched broadcast on March 31  you might have thought that the best response – from Turkey’s point of view – was a dignified silence. Yes  I suppose it was puerile. And yes  I accept that it was not in especially good taste. But it was what we call a joke. It is utterly bewildering – and slightly shocking – that the Turkish leader has failed to see this.   The episode has  as they say  got his goat  and he has deployed all Turkey’s diplomatic and political weight in an effort to persecute the satirist  35-year-old TV host Jan Boehmermann. He and the Turkish government have officially demanded that the presenter should be prosecuted for lèse-majesté – in this case causing offence to the leader of a foreign state – under an all-but defunct statute that dates back to 1871 and the reign of Kaiser Wilhelm II.   Incredible though it may seem  the journalist could face five years in jail. But what is truly incredible – indeed what is positively sickening – is that the German government has agreed at the express request of Angela Merkel that the prosecution should go ahead. She did not have to do so. She could have said no. The matter was entirely at her discretion. Plenty of German politicians were telling her that any such legal action would be an outrageous infringement of free speech – an act of censorship that smacked of some of the darkest moments in Germany’s 20th century history.   And yet she numbly decided to kowtow to the demands of Erdogan  a man who is engaged in a chilling suppression of Turkish freedom of expression. Erdogan only became president 18 months ago – and yet in that time prosecutors have opened 1 845 cases against people accused of insulting him  including a doctor who posted a picture of Erdogan on social media  next to a picture of Gollum.   It is no use saying that the case against Boehmermann is an obvious dud  or that it will be thrown out by the German court. Think of the impact in Turkey. Imagine how you would feel if you were a Turkish journalist  worried about what you could say  and you saw Angela Merkel – the leader of the most populous and richest country in the EU  this club of soi-disant liberal western nations – cravenly siding with the whim of an autocrat.   You would feel alone  frightened that even Germany was unwilling to stick up for you; and you would be right. Everyone knows why she has done it. Everyone knows why Angela Merkel is so cynically and so desperately determined to appease the Turkish leader – or at least to do nothing to irritate him; and that is because in the next few weeks and months we could have another migration crisis in the eastern Mediterranean.   We all know that the original problem was exacerbated by Germany’s open-door policy. Angela Merkel presented herself as a kind of EU Statue of Liberty – and the result was a pull factor that brought migrants flooding to Germany and other countries  via Turkey  on a scale not seen for decades. And now a deal has been done – a fragile deal by which Turkey agrees to take back refugees from Greece  in exchange for cash  and renewed promises of EU membership.   But it is Turkey’s hand on the tap. Erdogan  if he chooses  can allow the trickle to turn back into a flood – with devastating consequences not just for Merkel  but for the whole project of EU integration. The British referendum is on a knife edge. All the usual suspects are out there  trying to confuse the British public  and to persuade them that they must accept the accelerating loss of democratic self-government as the price of economic prosperity.   We have heard from the IMF (which got the Asian crisis completely wrong)  as well as the banks and the CBI  all of whom were wrong about the euro. Davos man – the kind of people whose club-class air tickets are paid by the taxpayer  all the lobbyists and corporate affairs directors of the big companies: they are all increasingly nervous that they have been rumbled  that people can see the emperor has no clothes and that Britain could have a glorious future outside the EU.   They all know that there is one event in the next few weeks that could remind the British people of at least one salient point in this debate – that this country has lost control of its frontiers – and that is another migration crisis on the borders of the EU  and within the EU itself. That is one reason why it is essential for Angela to suck up to Erdogan. That is why this egregious prosecution has drawn not a peep from the UK.  No one believes that Erdogan is a goat-fancier or that muffled baa-ing is to be heard from the presidential suite in Ankara. But in a free and pluralist society there is no reason why a self-professed satirist should not make a joke about it. The process of EU integration means the wholesale erosion of democracy; and it would seem that protecting that process means the erosion of free speech as well. The whole thing is infamous.

A Labour councillor from Luton was recently discovered to have tweeted that Adolf Hitler was “the greatest man in history”. What was going through her mind?  What did Aysegul Gurbuz find so admirable about the Nazi leader? Maybe she has a thing about those Nazi uniforms  or the weird camp salute they used to have. Perhaps she liked Hitler’s lust for world domination. It might be that the budding Labour student politician – she appears to be active at Warwick university – liked the way Hitler was a vegetarian; or his fondness of dogs; or his teetotallism.  If it was any of these things  then the former Labour councillor (she has since been removed) might like to say. Otherwise  we are left with the overwhelming conclusion that the reason she admires him above all other men in history is the reason most sane people abhor his memory – namely that he unleashed genocide against six million Jews. That’s what she seems to find admirable: that he was responsible for the gas chambers.  Now  Miss Gurbuz is a young woman; and her defenders would presumably argue that she is naive and easily misled. But for someone to hold those views  and be a councillor for the Labour Party  suggests to me that there is something seriously wrong with the Labour Party.  And there is. There is a cancer in Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party – and it is metastasising the whole time. Veteran Jewish Labour MPs such as Louise Ellman are being bullied in their constituencies – simply for sticking up for Israel’s basic right to exist. At Oxford university  the hip young students at the Labour Club now routinely refer to Jewish students as “Zios”. Even in the Woking Labour party  the deputy chairman Vicki Byrne has (twice) been suspended – for sending out tweets that were deemed to be anti-semitic. Jewish donors to Labour  hitherto generous  are refusing to give any more.  What is going on? To understand this anti-semitic sickness – this new boldness in the use of virulent anti-Israel and anti-Jewish language – you must grasp what has happened to Labour. It has been captured by the Corbynistas; and the Corbynistas believe in the most extreme ideology that Labour has ever espoused. It’s not just a question of bringing back the unions or sending Britain’s nuclear submarines to sea without missiles aboard. In the Corbynista worldview  capitalism is wicked  bankers are evil  Tories are scum and most geo-political discontents can be traced to the existence or behaviour of Israel.  To be fair  these views have long been prevalent among some parts of the Labour Party. It is just that they have never been on top; they have never commanded the party before. These views – explicitly rejected by Blair and Brown – are now the driving agenda of the Corbyn Labour party; and the tragedy is that we cannot dismiss them as the foaming irrelevance of a party doomed to opposition.  In less than a month’s time  there is a real danger that the Corbynistas will capture the London mayoralty. Who nominated Jeremy Corbyn for the party leadership? Sadiq Khan. How did Khan himself secure the mayoral nomination? By ruthlessly outmanoeuvring the favourite – Blairite Tessa Jowell – and sucking up to the Corbynistas. And now – unless we can elect Zac Goldsmith – they will plant the red flag back on the top of City Hall.  And  yes  it matters desperately. The Mayor of London has a spending budget far bigger than many Whitehall departments and he runs an economy bigger than most EU countries. He has unilateral power to raise or cut the council tax. He has absolute control over fares on public transport. He can sack the police chief; he can set the law enforcement and recruitment priorities of the biggest police force in the country. If he wants to build a bridge or a cable car or a tunnel – he can. If he wants to introduce a new low carbon bus  or a new bike hire scheme or a new Olympicopolis cultural centre  he can. He has sole power to greenlight skyscrapers  and he can use his vast planning authority for good or ill.  With no parliamentary procedures and no backbenchers to worry about  the mayor can get more things done – and faster – than any Whitehall department. But he must be responsible with Londoners’ money  and Sadiq Khan is wrong to propose to fund a fares cut by taking £2 billion out of TfL’s budget. That will cost Londoners vital infrastructure investment. People will pay for it in delays and overcrowding. Above all  it will undermine the ability of the city to negotiate with the Treasury. It is a big mistake.  But perhaps the mayor’s most important function is to set the tone for political discourse in the city – to bring people together: to be a force for inclusiveness  and moderation  and tolerance; and that means emphatically not setting community against community. That  alas  is not the Corbynista agenda.  Sadiq Khan has himself belatedly admitted that Labour is afflicted with anti-semitism. He has rightly called it a “badge of shame”. But for years now he has been sharing platforms with some of the most backward and sectarian forces in Islam – men such as Sulaiman Ghani  who has denounced gays and called women “subservient”  and called for the release of al-Qaeda terrorists.  Khan spoke at an event with a man called Azam Tamimi  who threatened reprisals of “fire throughout the world” after the Mohammed cartoons – words Khan dismissed as “flowery language”. Khan has repeatedly spoken at jihadi flag-waving events sponsored by the Islam Channel  which has been criticised by Ofcom for condoning marital rape. Khan hired a speech- writer who speculated that the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby was staged.  In Islam and the Labour Party there is a struggle going on  and in both cases Khan – whatever his real views – is pandering to the extremists. I don’t want him running our capital. Zac Goldsmith is a man of principle  a passionate campaigner  a One Nation Tory who has served his Richmond constituency so well that he recorded the biggest increase in his majority in 2015. He must win.

That is partly because their fate seems so unjust. This disaster isn’t their fault. They don’t have some new strain of the Seventies “British disease”. The plant is not a hotbed of union activity.   On the contrary  these workers have agreed over the past few years to make substantial reductions in jobs and big increases in productivity. They make superb quality steel. They offer it at a reasonable price. It is just that the Wales plant has been overwhelmed by a series of misfortunes over which they – the workers – have absolutely no control; and these misfortunes  moreover  arise in policy areas over which these workers might reasonably expect their elected government to have some control  but which the UK has simply lost; abandoned; surrendered; supinely given up as part of our membership of the EU.   There is the massive global dumping of cheap Chinese steel  subsidised by a Beijing government that is itself alarmed by impending job losses in the sector. Then there are the excessive fuel bills that this country currently imposes on industry. When you are running blast furnaces the cost of energy matters a great deal. A recent report by the Business  Innovation and Skills parliamentary committee said that UK steelmakers were facing energy costs as much as 80 per cent higher than the EU median. Even if that figure is high  there can be no doubt that the UK’s various climate change policies – largely generated by Ed Miliband – have been highly damaging for British manufacturing.   Then  I am afraid  there is Brussels  which is exacerbating both problems. It is one of the features of membership that we must not only accept that about 60 per cent of our legislation – primary and secondary – comes from the EU. We must also accept a fatal loss of flexibility  an inability to take decisions that might be in our national interest – and an inability even to make good our own mistakes.  Take the glut of Chinese steel. It seems that the EU Commission has been considering a broad range of anti-dumping measures for some time. It is also clear that before Tata took the decision to close Port Talbot  the UK was one of the countries to be lobbying against such tariffs.  Some have suggested that this was out of a general desire to suck up to the Chinese; others that it was a principled aversion to tariffs  and recognition that such import duties would hit domestic consumers of steel. Since the Port Talbot crisis blew up  the story seems to have changed. We are now told that the UK does indeed favour anti-dumping measures  though not of the kind that the EU Commission has been proposing.  The result? Probably nothing. Nothing will happen in the near future  if ever  because there is no agreement round the table in Brussels.  Even when we want to change tack on tariffs  we can’t – because we have given up control.  Contrast the US  where – wham – they have applied 266 per cent tariffs on dumped Chinese steel. Contrast China itself  which – to add insult to injury – has just slapped 46 per cent duties on steel from Port Talbot. Britain can do nothing to mimic these steps  because we have given up control.   Exactly the same point can be made about energy costs. It is true that much of the burden of these high UK energy bills is self-imposed. There is a sense in which Miliband’s bonkers plan has succeeded. We have certainly cut our CO2 emissions – but only by applying such crippling levies to UK industry that much of this manufacturing has simply gone elsewhere – along with the CO2 production. We may feel virtuous about cutting our CO2  but it is unlikely that the planet notices the difference.  The Conservative Government is sensibly trying to make amends for Miliband’s folly  and to cut the costs of energy for industry – but at every turn we have the problem of the EU  and the objections of Brussels to anything that looks like state aids.  Even when we are trying to address our home-grown mistakes  even when we are simply trying to bring down our energy costs so that they are more in line with the rest of the EU  we face the same difficulty: we no longer call the shots  even when thousands of jobs are at stake.  When this referendum campaign began  and I said that the key issue was sovereignty  I remember people giving me pitying looks. No one cares about sovereignty  they said. Well  losing sovereignty is just a fancy way of talking about losing control – and I think people care passionately about it.   As Michael Howard said yesterday  it is absolutely true that we cannot systematically check to see whether doctors practising in this country can speak good enough English. It is absolutely true  as Priti Patel has pointed out  that uncontrolled immigration from the EU has put a massive strain on the NHS. I spoke to one long-serving Hertfordshire GP who said she had never seen such pressure – and what can we do? Nothing. We can’t take emergency action against dumped Chinese steel  even with British industry on its knees. We can’t cut our own self-imposed energy costs. We can’t set our own language tests for practising doctors. We can’t control our borders.   What do we get for this sacrifice of control? Access  supposedly  to the giant EU market. Well  plenty of countries have access to that market. US exports to the EU have been growing faster than ours  and so have Switzerland’s – and both those countries have kept control of their democracies. The EU system is being daily exposed in this debate as an anachronism  and membership is increasingly cumbersome and anti-democratic. Nowhere else are they conducting a giant experiment of trying to fuse so many countries into one.  It is time to ignore the doomsters  get out  go global.  It is time to take back control of our country – not to speak of about £10 billion net. We would have more money  and more freedom to rescue the British steel industry – and we might even succeed.

But I cannot conceal my elation as the news comes in from Palmyra and it is reported that the Syrian army is genuinely back in control of the entire Unesco site.  There may be booby traps in the ruins  but the terrorists are at last on the run. Hooray  I say. Bravo – and keep going. Yes  I know. Assad is a monster  a dictator. He barrel-bombs his own people. His jails are full of tortured opponents. He and his father ruled for generations by the application of terror and violence – and yet there are at least two reasons why any sane person should feel a sense of satisfaction at what Assad’s troops have accomplished.  The first is that no matter how repulsive the Assad regime may be – and it is – their opponents in Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) are far  far worse. These are the people who have carved out this foul statelet in the desert  this dark star whose tractor beam of evil has sucked in so many pathetic would-be jihadists from Britain and other countries in western Europe. These are the nutjobs whose hideous ideology expressed itself again last week at Zaventem airport and Maelbeek metro station.  They somehow claim a religious justification for the murder and maiming of hundreds of innocent civilians. Assad’s regime may be thuggish and brutal and callous and evil in its own way. But these people are warped and sick almost beyond belief. They burn people alive – simply for holding to a slightly different version of Islam. They throw gays off cliffs or out of windows. They put their opponents in cages and then lower those cages into swimming pools  all filmed to the accompaniment of their droning music and their pompous commentary.  They are engaged in what can only be called genocide of the poor Yazidis (though for some baffling reason the Foreign Office still hesitates to use the term genocide). They are a threat to our security in Europe; they are a nightmare for the people of Syria. If ever a group of terrorists deserved to be wiped off the face of the Earth  to be expunged from the roll of the human race – that group is Isil.  And then there is a second reason why I rejoice at the news from Palmyra – and although I am aware that for many people this is a very secondary consideration  it is  for me  of deep emotional importance. The victory of Assad is a victory for archaeology  a victory for all those who care about the ancient monuments of one of the most amazing cultural sites on Earth. The monsters of Isil were not just content to murder anyone who refused to accept their barbaric version of Islam. They were so small  so narrow  so stunted in their understanding of the will of God that they regarded any pre-Islamic building or structure – no matter how beautiful – as being somehow a blasphemy. They have mined  bombed and demolished some of the most sublime buildings in the world. They took the devoted curator of the site  Khaled al-Assad  and punished him for his scholarship by killing him in the amphitheatre.  The period in which Isil has held Palmyra – now almost a year – has been a moral and cultural catastrophe. And yes  that is why I am glad that they have been driven from the site.  On April 19  we in London will show our solidarity with Palmyra by erecting in Trafalgar Square a digitally reproduced copy of the 15-metre gateway of the Temple of Bel. The project is being led by the Institute of Digital Archaeology  and it is a joint venture with Harvard  Oxford and Dubai’s Museum of the Future.  It will not be perfect. It will not be made of the same pinkish-golden stone of that original temple gateway  which Isil has blown to atoms. It will be made of resin. But it will still look amazing  and it will symbolise our collective determination – across the world – to put this ghastly epoch behind us  and to remember that for almost 2 000 years there was a willingness on the part of every conqueror who came to Palmyra to enjoy the architecture for what it was.  That temple was sacred once to Bel; then it was a church in the Byzantine period; and then it was a mosque. No one  until these sickos  thought to destroy it. I am glad the gateway will be going up in London  because I hope it will also be a sign of our British determination to be useful in the reconstruction of the country.  It is alas very hard to claim that the success of the Assad forces is a result of any particular British or indeed Western policy. How could it be? We rightly loathe his regime and what it stands for  and for the last few years we have been engaged in an entirely honourable mission to build an opposition to Assad that was not composed simply of Isil. That effort has not worked  not so far.  It has been Putin who with a ruthless clarity has come to the defence of his client  and helped to turn the tide. If reports are to be believed  the Russians have not only been engaged in air strikes against Assad’s opponents  but have been seen on the ground as well. If Putin’s troops have helped winkle the maniacs from Palmyra  then (it pains me to admit) that is very much to the credit of the Russians. They have made the West look ineffective; and so now is the time for us to make amends  and to play to our strengths.  We have some of the greatest archaeological experts in the world. I hope that the Government will fund them to go to Syria and help the work of restoration. It is far cheaper than bombing  and more likely to lead to long-term tourism and economic prosperity. One day Syria’s future will be glorious  but that will partly depend on the world’s ability to enjoy its glorious past. British experts should be at the forefront of the project.

Khan is the man who experimented with Corbyn and wrecked the Labour Party  and now he wants to experiment with the Mayoralty and wreck London.  All Khan's policies are another dangerous Corbyn experiment: his plan to create a special unit for the striking trade union bosses in City Hall  his £1.9 billion black hole in the transport budget  and his housing policy that will make the problem worse.

Indeed  I hold that the story of the past 100 years has been very largely about how America rose to global greatness – and how America has helped to preserve and expand democracy around the world. In two global conflicts  and throughout the Cold War  the United States has fought for the founding ideals of the republic: that government of the people  by the people  for the people should not perish from the earth.   So it is on the face of it a bit peculiar that US government officials should believe that Britain must remain within the EU – a system in which democracy is increasingly undermined.   Some time in the next couple of months we are told that President Obama himself is going to arrive in this country  like some deus ex machina  to pronounce on the matter. Air Force One will touch down; a lectern with the presidential seal will be erected. The British people will be told to be good to themselves  to do the right thing. We will be informed by our most important ally that it is in our interests to stay in the EU  no matter how flawed we may feel that organisation to be. Never mind the loss of sovereignty; never mind the expense and the bureaucracy and the uncontrolled immigration.   The American view is very clear. Whether in code or en clair  the President will tell us all that UK membership of the EU is right for Britain  right for Europe  and right for America. And why? Because that – or so we will be told – is the only way we can have “influence” in the counsels of the nations.   It is an important argument  and deserves to be taken seriously. I also think it is wholly fallacious – and coming from Uncle Sam  it is a piece of outrageous and exorbitant hypocrisy.   There is no country in the world that defends its own sovereignty with such hysterical vigilance as the United States of America. This is a nation born from its glorious refusal to accept overseas control. Almost two and a half centuries ago the American colonists rose up and violently asserted the principle that they – and they alone – should determine the government of America  and not George III or his ministers. To this day the Americans refuse to kneel to almost any kind of international jurisdiction. Alone of Western nations  the US declines to accept that its citizens can be subject to the rulings of the International Criminal Court in The Hague. They have not even signed up to the Convention on the Law of the Sea. Can you imagine the Americans submitting their democracy to the kind of regime that we have in the EU?   Think of Nafta – the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement – that links the US with Canada and Mexico. Suppose it were constituted on the lines of the EU  with a commission and a parliament and a court of justice. Would the Americans knuckle under – to a Nafta commission and parliament generating about half their domestic law? Would they submit to a Nafta court of justice – supreme over all US institutions – and largely staffed by Mexicans and Canadians whom the people of the US could neither appoint nor remove? No way. The idea is laughable  and completely alien to American traditions. So why is it essential for Britain to comply with a system that the Americans would themselves reject out of hand? Is it not a blatant case of “Do as I say  but not as I do”?   Of course it is. As for this precious “influence”  so dearly bought  I am not sure that it is all it is cracked up to be – or that Britain’s EU membership is really so valuable to Washington. Since the very foundation of the Common Market  the Washington establishment has supported the idea of European integration. The notable state department figure George W Ball worked on drafting the Schuman plan in 1950. He was a pallbearer at the funeral of Jean Monnet  the architect of the European project.   The Americans see the EU as a way of tidying up a continent whose conflicts have claimed huge numbers of American lives; as a bulwark against Russia  and they have always conceived it to be in American interests for the UK – their number one henchperson  their fidus Achates – to be deeply engaged. Symmetrically  it has been a Foreign Office superstition that we are more important to Washington if we can plausibly claim to have “influence” in Brussels. But with every year that passes that influence diminishes.   It is not just that we are being ever more frequently outvoted in the council of ministers  and our officials ever more heavily outnumbered in the Commission. The whole concept of “pooling sovereignty” is a fraud and a cheat. We are not really sharing control with other EU governments: the problem is rather that all governments have lost control to the unelected federal machine. We don’t know who they are  or what language they speak  and we certainly don’t know what we can do to remove them at an election.   When Americans look at the process of European integration  they make a fundamental category error. With a forgivable narcissism  they assume that we Europeans are evolving – rather haltingly – so as to become just like them: a United States of Europe  a single federal polity. That is indeed what the eurozone countries are trying to build; but it is not right for many EU countries  and it certainly isn’t right for Britain.   There is a profound difference between the US and the EU  and one that will never disappear. The US has a single culture  a single language  a single and powerful global brand  and a single government that commands national allegiance. It has a national history  a national myth  a demos that is the foundation of their democracy. The EU has nothing of the kind. In urging us to embed ourselves more deeply in the EU’s federalising structures  the Americans are urging us down a course they would never dream of going themselves. That is because they are a nation conceived in liberty. They sometimes seem to forget that we are quite fond of liberty  too.

The UK remains a member of the EU for the moment and it will take some time to work through the implications of their decision to leave.  In terms of our existing trade arrangements  the immediate effects of the leave vote on New Zealand are likely to be limited and we expect that trade and other business activities will continue smoothly in the interim.

Here’s a run-down of the Scottish Parliament 2016 Holyrood election in numbers:  At over a million  the SNP polled a record number of constituency votes – 1 059 897 to be precise. No party has ever done this before. The previous highest number was 908 392  polled by Labour in 1999.  In fact  the SNP polled more than Labour and the Tories put together. Collectively they polled 1 016 105 votes.  The SNP has won 59 constituency seats  surpassing the previous record of 53 seats  achieved by Labour in 1999  as well as the SNP in 2011.  The SNP has polled 46.5 per cent in the constituency vote  up from 45.4 per cent in 2011. This is higher than the previous record.  The SNP won a clean sweep of six out of Scotland’s seven cities: Glasgow  Dundee  Aberdeen  Inverness  Stirling and Perth.  The Liberal Democrats made no progress. They won the same number of seats and their constituency vote is down to its lowest level since devolution.  This is the lowest Labour vote in Scotland since the First World War  and the last time they finished third was 1910.

I am very sorry that the result of the referendum is for the UK to leave the European Union. However  the British people have spoken and we fully respect their decision.  I want to assure the Irish public that we have prepared to the greatest extent possible for this eventuality.  There will be no immediate change to the free flow of people  goods and services between our islands.  We have previously set out our main concerns in the event of Brexit. These relate to the potential impacts for trade and the economy  for Northern Ireland  for the common travel area and for the European Union itself.  We have engaged in detailed contingency planning for the possibility of this result. Today at Government  we agreed to publish a summary of the key actions we will now take to address the contingencies arising from the UK’s decision. Our primary objective remains to protect and advance this country’s interests.  I propose to further brief leaders of the Opposition on those actions later today.  The Summer Economic Statement  published earlier this week  includes an assessment of the potential economic impact of a UK vote to leave the EU.  Ireland is a strong  open and competitive economy – our ongoing economic recovery is testament to our resilience.  We will continue to implement policies that prioritise economic stability  growth and job creation.  In the immediate term  the Minister for Finance and his officials are in close contact with the Central Bank  the NTMA and our international partners to ensure that any short-term market volatility is carefully managed. They will continue to monitor and assess developments.  The implications of this vote for Northern Ireland and for relations between North and South on this island will require careful consideration. These will be a particular priority for the Irish Government.  We will approach these issues in the same spirit of partnership that has underpinned the peace process and has transformed relationships on this island since the Good Friday Agreement.  I welcome the Prime Minister’s clear statement that Northern Ireland’s interests will be fully reflected in the British Government’s negotiating position.  I will meet with colleagues from the Northern Ireland Executive on Monday week at the North/South Ministerial Council where we will have detailed discussions on how to best approach these new circumstances - acting in the best interests of all of the people of Ireland  North and South.  In the medium term a related concern is that of the Common Travel Area between Britain and Ireland.  For our part  the Irish Government will do our utmost in upcoming discussions to maintain the Common Travel Area and minimise any possible disruptions to the flow of people  goods and services between these islands.  We are also acutely aware of the concerns which will be felt across the Irish community in Britain. I want to assure them that the Irish Government will also have their interests in our thinking as we approach the forthcoming negotiations. It is important to remember that the position of Irish citizens within the EU will be unaffected.  The other key concern that the Government has expressed about a British departure from the EU relates to the impact on the Union itself.  Ireland will  of course  remain a member of the European Union.  That is profoundly in our national interest.  After more than 40 years of membership  we have built up strong bonds of partnership with all the other member states  and with the European institutions  that will continue to serve us well. We must now begin a period of reflection and debate on how we can renew the Union of 27 and equip it for the challenges ahead .  There will be a discussion of the next steps at the meeting of the European Council next week.  I will clearly set out our national position at that meeting   and I will ensure that our particular national interests are fully respected as we prepare to enter the next phase of negotiations.  These negotiations may not commence for some months yet  and will take a considerable amount of time to complete. In that regard  it is important to stress that Britain remains a member of the European Union until negotiations have been concluded.  We must take this breathing space...and use it wisely.  Finally  I would like to express my personal best wishes to Prime Minister Cameron.  We have worked closely together at a time of unprecedented warmth in relations between our two countries.  He has taken a decision this morning  which he believes is in the interests of his country.  I wish him all the very best for the future.  Finally I’d like to reiterate that while Ireland’s future lies within the European Union  Ireland’s strong and close relationship with the UK will remain.

Of course he is synonymous with the Royal Dublin Club from the 1950s on  when he blazed a trail through the world of golf. His record of achievement stands apart  including playing for Ireland in 15 world cups and 10 consecutive Ryder Cups.

Yesterday evening  I offered Micheál Martin a full partnership government. It is an offer that reflects the way in which people voted in the general election and the respective mandates of both parties and independents.  Today  Deputy Martin rejected that offer. I believe that this decision is a serious mistake and one which was driven by narrow party interests rather than the national interest.  Ireland needs a stable and lasting government to meet the many national and international challenges facing the country. Fine Gael’s preferred option of a full partnership is the best option for providing the necessary stability and it is very regrettable that Fianna Fáil has rejected this historic opportunity.

More than a year ago  we established a Special Commission of Inquiry into the greyhound industry after very disturbing reports emerged of cruelty to animals and other illegal activities.  We have now received the report of the Commission  conducted by former High Court Judge Michael McHugh  and the findings are damning. A link to the whole report is below  but some of the findings include:  • The mass killing of greyhounds. The report found  “In NSW in the last 12 years… somewhere between 48 891 and 68 448 dogs were killed because they were considered too slow to pay their way or were unsuitable for racing.” In the industry  they call this “wastage”. It’s not wastage: it is the unnecessary slaughtering of tens of thousands of healthy dogs.  • The widespread practice of “live baiting”. This is where live animals  like rabbits  are used as bait to be chased by dogs in training sessions.  The report found that  even though this is already illegal and carries heavy penalties  “a trainer  who admitted to engaging in live baiting  testified that about 10-20% of trainers engaged in live baiting.”   • The systemic deception of the public concerning the numbers of deaths and injuries of dogs. It is estimated that 180 greyhounds per year sustain catastrophic injuries during races such as skull fractures or broken backs that result in their immediate death. But the commission found that “Greyhound Racing NSW had adopted a policy of deliberately misreporting the extent of injuries suffered by greyhounds at racetracks.”  • The industry is not capable  in the short or medium term  of reforming. The report found that “it appears unlikely that the issue of the large scale killing of healthy greyhounds by the industry can be addressed successfully in the future.” In fact  the report found that  "such is the culture of the industry and some of its leaders that it is no longer  if it ever was  entitled to the trust of the community."  One of the issues we have had to wrestle with is the positive impact of the greyhound racing industry. There are over 1000 direct jobs in the industry and nearly 6000 registered owners of greyhounds. Dog racing can be an important part of the social fabric of regional towns. And  of course  having a punt on the dogs over a few beers is good fun for many people.   So  as Mr McHugh asked  do such benefits of the dog racing industry outweigh the shortcomings?   Based on this report  the Government believes they do not.   Greyhound racing has been banned in many countries and many states of the US and is legal in only eight countries around the world. NSW will be the first state in Australia to ban it.   Over the coming months  we will consult with the industry to help minimise the pain as best we can for the innocent industry participants as we work towards an orderly industry shutdown. We will develop a strategy to work with the RSPCA to manage the welfare of existing greyhounds. And the transition arrangement for Greyhound Racing NSW assets (like greyhound racing tracks) will ensure they are used for open public space  alternative sports facilities or other community use.  I feel much empathy for innocent trainers and those who will lose their job or hobby as a result of this. And I understand the disappointment of people who enjoy having a punt on the dogs. But we simply cannot and will not stand-by and allow the widespread and systemic mistreatment of animals.   You can read the full report here: http://www.greyhoundracinginquiry.justice.nsw.gov.au/

Today we introduced legislation into Parliament that will allow our Police to detain and question individuals  without charge  for up to 14 days if they are suspected of committing or planning terrorist acts. The laws will apply to anyone over 14 years of age.  It still shocks me that we would ever need to detain someone so young. But that is the reality we now face. This is why we are also doing all we can to protect our youth from radicalisation through preventative programs.  These new laws will come with protections  particularly for those aged under 18  to ensure they aren’t able to be used inappropriately. These protections include a requirement that detention beyond an initial 4 day period must be approved by a Supreme Court Judge.  No legislation will ever completely remove the terrorist threat. But this legislation has the strong backing of the Police as they work hard to keep us as safe as possible. We are thankful for all they do.

When their mum  Beth  started losing her sight at age 5  no one knew why.   Genomics has the potential to transform medicine to identify and treat diseases that are currently undetectable or incurable. NSW is a world leader in this area  and today we announced a new $1.5 million grant at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research to further advance genomic research.   Matt doesn’t let his eyesight hold him back. He loves riding his dirt bike and told me he wants to be Premier one day. I advised against it. But there just may be no stopping him.

We are fast-tracking the major conversion of ANZ Stadium in Homebush into a world class rectangular football stadium.   We have already committed to a new 30 000 seat stadium at Parramatta and this will be built during this term of government. Wanderers and Eels fans should get excited.   And  during our next term of government  we will also begin a refurbishment of Allianz Stadium.   There is also a $40 million package to be invested in NRL suburban facilities in NSW.   Through this process  we’ve been determined to make sure the economics stack up. We have secured content agreements with the various codes including 20 years of NRL Grand Finals and State of Origin matches  10 years of the Bledisloe Cup  and 12 years of marquee soccer events including Socceroos matches through an in-principle agreement with the FFA.   This will be a massive boost for the visitor economy for decades to come  generating jobs and further investment in NSW.  This $1.6 billion stadium investment is part of our broader vision to rebuild NSW. Over the next 4 years we are spending over $68 billion on building the hospitals  schools  roads and rail that the state needs and deserves.  It’s a great day for the codes. It’s a great day for the clubs. It’s a great day for the fans.

The new Parramatta light rail line will stop right near the Powerhouse  which will serve as an anchor for a new arts and cultural precinct.   With the size of the collection on display set to increase by at least 40 per cent  and the new museum being located in the geographical centre of Sydney  this is a big win for local  interstate and international visitors.  Every single dollar from the sale of the existing museum site in Ultimo will be invested into building this amazing new facility in Parramatta. It will be a museum that will be the envy of the nation.

Lucy Haslam and her son Dan were the people who convinced me that we must act in this area  so it is great to have Lucy (who now serves on our Medicinal Cannabis Advisory Council) as part of our delegation here in Israel - along with NSW Chief Scientist Mary O'Kane.  One of the core parts of this trade mission is building partnerships between NSW medical and research institutions and world leading Israeli institutions to ensure that we can pursue medical cannabis as quickly as possible - and as responsibly as possible.  I also met with the Israeli health minister who assured me that they will offer us access to their research and will partner with us as we find solutions to complex issues such as supply  distribution  dosages and training of our medical professionals.  I know that change can’t come soon enough for many… and  along with the clinical trials we already have underway  I believe this new partnership is a big step in the right direction.

I asked one of the boys what he dreamt of becoming when he was older.  “It’s hard to have dreams when you know they can’t come true ” he told me.  The situation here is nothing short of heartbreaking.  I don’t know where the cycle of thousands of years of violence ends.  But I do know that all kids should be able to dream. That they should have hope of a better future.  The team at the Aida refugee camp are doing a great job in a difficult situation. The money donated by the Australian Government - and therefore Australian taxpayers - is doing great work in helping these kids.   These kids are funny. They love soccer (Real Madrid  specifically). They love learning at school. And the hope is that they are given a chance to chase their dreams and enjoy the peace that  in NSW  we can take for granted.

I remember feeling overwhelmingly grateful and really quite moved that people had trusted our team to lead them.   That night I said we'd work hard  every day  for the next four years. And over this past year  I can honestly say we have given our all.   Not every decision we've made has been popular. That was never the aim. Hard decisions rarely please everyone. That's what makes them hard.   What I hope people see is that we are trying to make decisions that reach beyond and above politics for the greater good. Decisions that will grow NSW economically  decisions that will keep us safe  and decisions that will help our vulnerable.   In the past year we have:  * Created more jobs in NSW than all other states combined * Built and upgraded hospitals at Dubbo  Forbes  Wagga Wagga  Parkes  Campbelltown and Hornsby * Increased spending on health and education to record levels * Initiated a $60 million program to fight the scourge of domestic violence * Completed tunnelling on the Sydney Metro Northwest * Started construction on new rail  light rail  motorways  and road upgrades right across NSW  It's been a busy year. We've had some great achievements. We're not perfect - we've made some mistakes. But we've tried to do the right thing for NSW to build a brighter future for our kids and for generations to come.   And tonight... Well  I still feel exceptionally grateful for you putting your trust in us. I don't take it for granted. And we will get up and work hard for you again tomorrow - even those of you who leave 'constructive feedback' in the comments section. 😉  Cheers  Mike

They have a life story that many of us can barely comprehend.  As Christians in Iraq  they were persecuted as a minority. When ISIS overtook their home city of Mosul  they were told they needed to convert to Islam or pay taxes they couldn’t afford. They were repeatedly threatened with death.  They fled their home in July 2014 and found themselves in a refugee camp in Lebanon. Finally  their prayers were answered and they found themselves with an opportunity for a new life here in Australia.  Ayad told me today that his priorities are to learn English  get a job  to enroll his kids in school and to begin contributing to his new community. He is an art teacher  and I’m sure he’s got as much to teach his community as he has to learn from it.  There’s no point having the strongest economy in the nation if we don’t care for society’s most vulnerable  both within and beyond our borders. We’re committed to doing that in NSW with increased spending on homelessness services  addressing the scourge of domestic violence and giving better help to our disabled through the NDIS. We were also the first state to sign up to Gonski  which helps all our school kids  especially the most disadvantaged.  But our obligation to help those in need doesn’t end at the state border. I’m proud of the generous spirit that I see in people right across this state. I’m proud that we can welcome refugees who are in desperate need of a fresh start. And I’m proud that Iptesam  Ayad  Mark and Rita can now call NSW home.

Frederick Douglass wrote those words in 1855 and they are as true today as they were then.  Today at the University of Sydney we launched the Institute for Open Adoption Studies  a research body that will advance adoption in NSW. The Institute will receive $2.85 million in funding  and it is the first independent government funded research body of its kind in Australia.  I’m committed to increasing adoption numbers in NSW and helping more vulnerable children move into permanent and loving families. Today we also announced a further $2 million to progress existing adoption applications.  NSW already leads the nation in numbers of children adopted from care  but we must do more… because every child deserves a stable home.

We're determined to deliver the new rail lines  roads  schools and hospitals that NSW deserves.

The FBI then announced she would face no charges. This is an outrage and the rule of law has been turned upside down.  This weekend  we learned former President Clinton met with the Obama Administration Attorney general - the FBI director's boss - in private.   Three days later the FBI director announces no charges are being brought against Hillary Clinton.  The appearance is terrible. The decision is astounding. People have gone to jail for less severe breaches of classified information and national security.    Today Director Comey and the Obama Administration Department of Justice made it clear to the American people  and all those being unfairly prosecuted by the DOJ  that there is no accountability  no justice  and the Clintons are allowed to live by a different set of rules.   This is a loss for the rule of law and further degrades Americans' faith in the justice system.

And frankly  I've had enough of it from the Obama White House.  I will not let Hillary Clinton continue the liberal failing legacy when it comes to coal.

We've proven that liberty-loving citizens who stand together and fight can make a difference.   Just look at all you and I have accomplished over the past six years!   And think about what more we can do.  Think about what more we must do together -- for the sake of freedom's survival.

The last thing politicians should be doing is looking for ways to put more people out of work!  She is so out of touch that she doesn’t realize the consequences of her viewpoints.  If she traveled around the state of Kentucky she would see the benefits of the American coal industry. She'd know that coal production is more than partisan politics. It's energy  it's jobs  and it supports everything from water purification to power generation.   Maybe if Hillary stopped talking to the radical environmentalists and started talking to the people of Kentucky  she'd know the truth: the more restrictions we put on American energy production -- including coal -- the more we're risking our fragile economy  the more dependent we become on foreign sources of energy  and the harder it's going to be to dig ourselves out of $19 TRILLION in debt.

If we don’t know right and wrong  I think we have lost our way  and we have a great risk of going horribly in the wrong direction.  Sadly  we've lost our way on the value of human life.  Since the tragic Roe v. Wade decision  over 57 million unborn babies have been aborted -- and Hillary and the left think this is a cause worth standing for?  This is a travesty.  My Life at Conception Act would end this madness by legally recognizing the scientific fact that life begins at conception.  Using the Supreme Court's own words against them  my bill would use the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution to grant equal protection under the law to every American -- born or unborn.   You can count on me to fight for this bill  to finally end funding for Planned Parenthood   and stop the war on pro-life religious institutions.

You and I both know how important these races are -- especially with Hillary Clinton determined to continue President Obama's failed policies for four more years and a critical Supreme Court vacancy on the line.  But there's an even bigger reasons the special interests and tax-and-spenders are going to go all-out to defeat me in November.

JOIN OUR MONEYBOMB TODAY >> http://bit.ly/25nKjo4  When I first ran for the U.S. Senate  the Big Government "consensus" in Washington  D.C. was at its height.  Few members of either party dared question Washington  D.C.'s out-of-control spending and debt. Or government spying. Or the Federal Reserve's "print-now  ask-questions-later" policies. Or never-ending military intervention.  Knowing I would take all of their madness on  the Big Government establishment of BOTH parties went all out to defeat me.   But with the help of patriots like you from all over the country  I shocked the political world and won.  It hasn't been easy -- and we have so much more work to do -- but you and I have made a big difference together by standing strong unapologetically for liberty and our Constitution.  Together  we galvanized the country for civil liberties against the Obama administration's lawless use of drones.  We stood strong against taxpayer handouts to foreign governments.  We stopped President Obama's mad rush to gun control in 2013.  We've fought BOTH parties' rush to hike the national debt limit  calling for the REAL spending cuts that are critical if we're ever going to address our $19 TRILLION in debt.   We stopped President Obama's mad dash to put American boots on the ground in Syria and showed how misguided military invention sometimes can embolden our enemies -- something that's taboo in most establishment circles.  We forced expiration of Section 215 of the so-called "PATRIOT Act " which the NSA used to justify it's unconstitutional bulk collection of data on American citizens.  And just recently  we forced the U.S. Senate to vote on Audit the Fed and legislation defunding Planned Parenthood.  At every turn  you and I fighting and DEFEATING the Washington machine.  That's why they will come after with everything they have this election year.  They know just forcing these battles is a "win" for you and me.  The Big Government consensus in Washington  D.C. is crumbling.  And you and I are holding the sledgehammer.  All of this comes at a price . . .  It's made me and my reelection tax-and-spenders' number-one target.  The only way I will beat them is the same way I've beaten them before.  With you.  So please  if at all possible  agree to your most generous contribution of $50  $25 or even $10 right away: http://bit.ly/25nKjo4  We still have work to do.

Combined with the Presidential race it is difficult to conceive of a reason to confirm a judge before the end of this term.   The President gets to nominate but the senate must consent  and I am not simply going to let him have his way without a heck of a fight.

What kind of presidential candidate brags about putting hard working Americans out of business?

I won't let her do it. I am running to fight for Kentucky and to stop the democrats from killing more coal jobs.   Stand with me to end the war on coal by donating today: http://bit.ly/1U1CT6c  The problem with liberals like Hillary and President Obama  is that they want to abuse the authority of the executive branch to choose winners and losers in business.  They will regulate a business straight out of business if it benefits their agenda somehow - and that's what they're doing to coal.  Through executive order and through the EPA  our coal industry has faced a major onslaught of regulation that has burdened the business incredibly.  This has not only been a war against one of Kentucky's leading industries -- it has literally been a war on jobs. Ten thousand workers have lost their jobs because of President Obama's malicious disregard for American workers.    Hillary thinks this is all A-okay? She wants to continue those plans?  That's incredible. Really  it's madness.  I have seen the look on the faces of hard working people in this country  who very much want to work  who are being laid off because of President Obama's war on coal.  I’ve personally witnessed the harmful effects of these disastrous  abusive regulations.  That anyone would so proudly pledge to continue these mistakes is just shocking.  I have fought to stop his war on coal at every turn  and let me tell you... if Hillary Clinton thinks she’s going to one-up Obama’s vendetta against coal  she’s got another thing coming.  I will not tolerate this war on jobs.  I’ll fight for Kentucky every day in the Senate. I will stand strong for coal and for American business.  Will you stand with me?

The candidates and their campaigns (including SuperPACs) have been guilty of a lot of destructive  personal  and negative attacks  and the news media is an enthusiastic enabler of this kind of destructiveness. However  pettiness won't solve America's problems. Candidates need to focus on the issues and how they plan to get America back on track  instead of getting caught up in these unnecessary but destructive attacks. http://bit.ly/25H111M

John Kasich will stick with his positive issue oriented approach which may have him 5 points ahead of Trump in the latest #Ohio poll.  5. Donald J.

What do you think will happen on March 15th? #election2016  1. The biggest story of the night was Bernie Sanders's win over Hillary Clinton. A huge upset with troubling implications for the Clinton candidacy.  2. Donald J. Trump's wins from #Michigan to #Mississippi to #Hawaii proved he is a truly national candidate.  3. Ted Cruz had a pretty good night with a good showing in Mississippi  coming in second in Michigan and winning Idaho. He is clearly second to Trump.  4. Marco Rubio had a disastrous night and is on life support. He will probably lose Florida.  5. John Kasich gained some delegates but coming in third in Michigan did not help him. #Ohio is now life and death for his candidacy.

Subsequently  many of you sent strong messages of support for today’s endorsement  while many others sent equally strong messages of disappointment. In all candor  some of this critical dynamic reminds me of Passion Week which began with Hosannas from the people  and ended with “Crucify Him.” Yet Christ had not changed  just as Dr. Ben Carson has not changed his devotion to God  his fundamental policy convictions regarding the right path for our nation  or his undying commitment to Save America for Future Generations.  For those of you who seek to analyze this decision through a spiritual lens  we must ask how God’s purposes might have been thwarted if Daniel had not served in Babylon  or if Joseph had not served Pharaoh?  In a similar vein  Dr. Carson’s endorsement is not driven by political ambition or any “sell out” on Dr. Carson’s part -- rather Dr. Carson remains the same wise  practical  empirically-driven  and God-honoring leader and selfless servant he has always been.  While each of us is ultimately responsible to God and others for our response  I would ask those who have been so quick to judge and condemn to simply think about it further.  The thoughts below reflect Dr. Carson’s thinking on the challenges we face.   Let us reason together for a moment: ·       Our nation cannot survive another secular progressive administration  particularly under the leadership of someone like Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders.  If the Democrats win this next election  America as we know it will cease to exist.  ·      Dr. Carson is an empirical thinker  assessing realities and determining common sense solutions to achieve the desired goal. The reality is that Donald Trump  along with the talented team which he will no doubt assemble  is the Republican Party’s best opportunity to win back the White House.  Instead of Republican Party operatives falling on their sword regarding “anyone but Trump ” they should embrace the millions of newly interested Republicans  channeling their passion (and anger) into positive change and a likely victory. They should let the democratic process work.  ·      A majority of Dr. Carson supporters have consistently identified Donald Trump as their fallback choice  another outsider who can truly break the political paradigm of corruption and cronyism in Washington.  As we have said for many months now  “Donald Trump and Ben Carson sing from the same song book; they just sing in different keys.”  ·      Our strength is our unity.  In Dr. Carson’s sentiments from this morning  we cannot allow agents of division and political operatives to pit us against one another  or to thwart the voice of the people.  Donald Trump possesses the capability to unite Americans and represent all of “We The People” in ways that his leading opponents simply cannot do.  As Dr. Carson highlighted this morning  Donald Trump possesses the intellect  introspection (a surprise to many who do not truly know him)  adaptive leadership  and boldness needed to truly break the Washington DC political paradigm that holds America captive.   ·       As always  Dr. Carson is not being politically correct -- he simply wants to save America.  He simply wants to solve the great challenges we face.  This is why he has courageously and boldly endorsed Donald Trump as the best way to help “We The People.” The man who we have loved and followed has not changed – he continues to walk in faith as his Lord provides wisdom and a “lamp unto his path.”  As always  my comments simply cannot do justice to the true depth or significance of Dr. Carson’s thoughts.  I commend Dr. Carson’s full comments at this morning’s press announcement. I have never heard him to be more clear  convicted  or compelling.  He remains laser focused  always seeking to do the right thing for the right reasons.  While some of you may still disagree with Dr. Carson’s endorsement decision  may the “banner of love” characterize our thoughts and actions.  May each of us avoid the politics of personal destruction and divisive rhetoric that besets our land.  May each of us be part of the solution  and not part of the problem.  May each of us seek to Save America for Future Generations.  Ultimately  may God heal our land  as He inspires and revives “We The People.”  Prayerfully and respectfully to all   General Bob Dees Campaign Chairman Carson for President 2016

We must be careful not to continue our current path  which is littered with uncertainty at best and ruination at worst. We can make changes to our system and that change starts now with  “We the People.”   We can have disagreements  but it is critical that we not allow those disagreements to divide us as a party or as a country.   It is with that in mind that I endorse Donald Trump for President. I have known Donald for many years. He is a successful businessman who has built a recognizable global brand that no one can question. His experience as a businessman is exactly what we need to move our economic engine in the right direction and empower those who have been left out of the American dream for far too long.  With our support  I am sure that we can help restore America's values and faith.    I know there will be some who want to underscore our differences and others will wish to return to statements he has made about me in the past  but that is politics. As a man of faith  all is forgiven and we have moved beyond the past  as the future is now.   Join me in supporting and rallying around the only candidate the GOP has that can defeat Hillary Clinton in 2016 and return America to that shining city on a hill.

Because of this  there needs to be a lot of propaganda  along with lies  intimidation and fear-mongering in order to get people foolishly acquiesce to war.

Just as the British chose to leave the EU  so should America get out of NATO. More of my thoughts below:

After all  he was the author of the American Declaration of Secession from the British empire. Jefferson understood that the states were all free  independent  and sovereign; that the union was a pragmatic compact between the free and independent states; that the federal government was delegated certain powers by the states for their benefit; and that the citizens of any state had the right to resume those powers should they decide that the union was no longer in their best interest. There was nothing “mystical” or magical or “perpetual” about it. More below:

Unfortunately it's also one of the worst times to travel. Of course  whenever Americans are suffering  you don't have to look far to discover the government cause.

Revenge and attacks are the usual response. America has gone through a few secession episodes itself  like many other nations throughout history. For example  when the American colonies seceded from Britain in 1776  the British did not take it too well  and war would follow. Neither did the U.S. northern states let the southern states secede peacefully in the 1860's. Do the British have to be vigilant if they're serious about their independence?

The fear of the unknown causes most individuals to give away and sacrifice every liberty that they were naturally born with. A population that is perpetually afraid ultimately ends up fearing liberty itself! The centralization of power is a great enemy of liberty. Political power (if it exists) should be as decentralized as possible. We have just witnessed an historic moment. British citizens have voted to leave the European Union! A gigantic lesson can be learned from this event. It proves that fear-mongering has its limits. It's not fool-proof. More below:

Does today’s Brexit vote  win or lose  similarly mark the spot where the once-inevitable march of globalism begins to recede?

The exceptionally horrific 20th century laid hundreds of millions of people into their graves who suffered under the horrible ideas of Socialism. However  memories fade. That's part of the human experience. People have a tendency to reproduce past mistakes.

How ironic that the champion of so-called "Democratic Socialism" is now seeking to undermine democracy in his quest for power.

There is no certainty in any business. Every business in a free market economy is only a short step from bankruptcy. No business possesses the power to make people buy what they do not want.

Wall Street  at least on paper  seems to be thriving. But grassroots America continues to suffer.  Why has no one challenged the conventional wisdom of Keynesian economic planning? Why haven't Keynesian economists and pundits been called to task? They got us into this mess. They've championed the perpetuation of it. Why the silence?

They convey important and valuable information that everyone uses to make decisions on how to allocate resources. Prices alert us to the supply and demand of any particular item or service in the economy. It's crucial that prices be accurate so that the best and most rational decisions can be made. In order to be accurate  prices must be left alone. When government intervenes  it turns accurate information into lies. It distorts how resources are allocated  creating massive imbalances in the economy. Then in a vicious cycle  government seeks to correct its previous meddling with even more interventions.

We might have to face the possibility that the future is less ideological  because populists by definition are less ideological. There is nothing wrong with issue libertarianism - single issue libertarianism. Ron Paul worked this very well  with regard to End The Fed  which was a populist uprising  and with regard to getting out of Iraq and Afghanistan. These were both populist sentiments that didn't need a lot of intellectualization to sell. The future is not necessarily left vs. right  red state vs. blue state. Rather it's centralization versus decentralization. PC versus the truth. More on libertarian populism below:  Libertarian Populism http://bit.ly/1YcUUwX

Unfortunately  such a view displays a gap in understanding the difference between free markets and an economy shackled with a hyper-interventionist government. We suffer from the latter  and desperately need the former.   I  myself  am against today's so-called "capitalism". It is a shadow of what America once used to be. America never had a total free market economy  which is a shame. Government  even at the very beginning  would meddle here and there. But the American economy was many magnitudes freer than it is today. We owe so much of the accumulated savings  capital  and wealth in America to that era. It's time to place the blame where it really belongs. It's time to start cutting the government chains off the economy so that free markets may breathe once again. More below: http://bit.ly/1UCldgR

In other words  you can elect "your guy" as long as "your guy" matches up with "their guy". This setup is used on foreign nations that the U.S. has invaded either directly or by proxy. For example  Syrians can form "their" government  but Assad can't win because he's been deemed a bad guy by the U.S. The Syrian Kurds want to form their own separate government  but the U.S. says "No" to that too. They must remain under the rule of Assad  even though he's been deemed a bad guy. Make sense? Can you see how the idea of voting has been destroyed both here and abroad?

Even --- and perhaps especially --- without answers forthcoming  it’s important to keep those troublesome questions percolating.  Wake up and smell the obfuscation.   For more details  click here.

No surprise  Donald Trump didn’t take the 4th of July off from tweeting about the failure of Obama and his former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in defeating ISIS and keeping innocent people safe (read all his tweets at the link).  Yet a recent Washington Post poll found that only 39% of Americans trust Trump to handle terrorism  while 50% trust Hillary to handle it.    Since the current Administration appears to be rudderless on this issue  and Hillary is promising us four more years of the same – indeed  when terrorists struck Benghazi and that much-vaunted “3 a.m. emergency call” arrived  she let it go to voice mail – I have to wonder how reliable this poll is.  I also wonder  with ISIS and its acolytes ramping up the attacks on innocent civilians worldwide  and Obama and Hillary continuing to cover their eyes  plug their ears  and blame Republicans  Christians  the NRA or anything other than radical Islamist militants  how long those poll numbers can possibly hold up in the face of grim reality.

In a hasty  mile-a-minute press conference  after which he didn’t take questions  FBI Director James Comey outlined some very serious conclusions about the extreme carelessness with which Hillary Clinton handled her classified communications and then asserted that “no reasonable prosecutor” would bring a criminal case against her.   While Comey should be commended just for dealing with this investigational nightmare --- he said it was like trying to put together a huge  unfinished jigsaw puzzle with pieces all over the floor --- I’ll bet I could come up with a pretty substantial list of “reasonable prosecutors” who would disagree with his conclusions.  “Gross negligence” at this level certainly meets the threshold for charging someone with a crime.   He said the FBI couldn’t find evidence of disloyalty or obstruction  but he described an incredible list of violations regarding her classified information  with 110 emails in 52 email chains containing classified material at the time they were sent.  Eight of those chains containing top secret stuff.  Thousands more emails were “up-classified” later; the fact that information can be up-classified is why it shouldn’t be on an unsecure system in the first place.  The FBI didn’t find direct evidence that her emails were hacked  Comey said  but he noted that since she used unsecure systems in hostile territories  it’s unlikely this didn’t happen.   So  to sum up:  Any reasonable person should have known not to do this.  None of these emails had any business being on a personal system.  Hacking by hostile foreign governments probably took place.  No charges recommended.   No wonder Comey didn’t take questions.  http://hucka.be/wpnxtF

He warned that as Americans were waving flags and watching fireworks  they shouldn’t let themselves get caught up in the “wrong” kind of patriotism.  That is  a “strident  exclusive” patriotism that “asserts a unique and superior ‘Americanism’” -- the type that excludes people beyond our borders by wanting to actually enforce border security  build a wall to stop unfettered illegal immigration  or vet would-be refugees to keep out those who want to kill us all.     This piece leaves me with three questions:  1. How does a former Labor Secretary not understand the negative effects of unfettered illegal immigration on American jobs and wages?  2.  If there’s nothing unique and superior about America  why are all of these illegal immigrants he’s defending willing to risk so much to get here?  3.  Does anyone doubt that this elitist  condescending  almost embarrassed view of American exceptionalism and patriotism by a former Bill Clinton official is also shared by Obama  Hillary and virtually everyone they surround themselves with?

But I hope you parents will take a few minutes to teach your kids what the day is really about: the anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.    Today  we take the freedoms it asserts for granted. Too many of us are willing to give them up and look the other way in exchange for a promise of security. But at the time  just signing that document was a dangerous act.  Some called its signers “traitors.”  Our Forefathers risked their property  their freedom  even their very lives to stand up against the King and demand their God-given right to be free  self-determining individuals.  To imagine how much courage that took  look at nations today where people brave threats from terrorists and dictators to stand in long lines just to vote – another right many Americans take too lightly.     I ask you to teach your kids about America’s heritage because a survey a few years ago by the Goldwater Institute found that we’re doing a lousy job of teaching it in schools.  Eighth graders at Arizona public schools were asked 10 questions taken from a U.S. citizenship test.  They had to get only 6 right to pass.  And how many could manage that?  Just 3.5 percent!      Only a quarter of the students knew that the first 10 Amendments to the Constitution are called the Bill of Rights.  Just a fraction more knew that George Washington was our first President  or that Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence.  Just 23% knew that the two parts of Congress are the House and Senate.  And fewer than 30% knew that the “supreme law of the land” is the Constitution.    I won’t hold that last one against the kids  though. I doubt that a third of our politicians  and at least half of the current Supreme Court Justices  know that  either.

But July 4th means more than fireworks  parades  beach parties and picnics.  It’s also considered America’s birthday  because it marks 240 years since the signing of the Declaration of Independence.  But to be completely accurate  America wasn’t born on July 4th  1776.  Britain’s King George III didn’t just send a happy birthday card and let the colonies go eat cake.  Bringing America into the world required many midwives.  It took the struggle and sacrifice of countless soldiers  many of them barely-trained and poorly-equipped volunteers  facing off against the most powerful military force on Earth.  And the smart money was not on America to win.   The birth of America actually stretched from April 18th  1775  when Paul Revere made his famous ride to warn the Minutemen that British troops were advancing on Lexington and Concord  to February 27th  1782  when the British Parliament finally voted to stop fighting.  America’s birth had a long labor: nearly seven years of war.  To put it plainly  we owe our very existence to a brilliant general  George Washington  and the first generation of American military members.     Their “Spirit of ‘76” has inspired every generation of US troops since then.  For more than two centuries  American troops have fought and died to secure the principles of the Declaration of Independence:  That all men are created equal  that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights  and that among these are life  liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  Important Note:  Not the guarantee of happiness  but the freedom to pursue it.      So this Fourth of July  enjoy the fireworks and fun  and celebrate America’s birthday.  But please remember to thank any military members you see.  Because without them  none of this would even exist.

I wish I could say to America  “You don’t look a day over 210 ” but when the US was 210  it was 1986  Ronald Reagan was President  and frankly  since then  the voters have sort of let the place go.  Then again  things had fallen to a pretty low ebb before Reagan’s election  too.  He proved that there’s nothing wrong with America that can’t be righted  if we just elect leaders with the intelligence  will and guts to follow the brilliant blueprint created by the Founders.  Right now  we have the equivalent of a July 4th car vacation with someone at the wheel who refuses to look at the map and thinks we’ll miraculously arrive at the right location if  every time we come to a crossroads  we just keep turning left.

Seems like an awfully long time just to tell them none of the classified documents she handled were MARKED “classified” (except the ones that were)  so it’s time to move on  and besides  at this point  with all our secrets already in the hands of hackers worldwide  “what difference does it make?”     Naturally  her camp has a different spin.  In an unintentionally hilarious statement  campaign spokesman Nick Merrill wrote that Hillary “gave a voluntary interview this morning about her email arrangements while she was Secretary…She is pleased to have had the opportunity to assist the Department of Justice in bringing this review to a conclusion.“  So pleased  she could hurl a lamp  I’d wager. By the way  it's not a "review " it's a federal investigation. That adjective "voluntary" is also debatable.  But I digress...    Merrill concluded  “Out of respect for the investigative process  she will not comment further on her interview."  And if anyone has respect for the “investigative process ” it’s Hillary “Vast Right-wing Conspiracy” Clinton.     One thing worth noting: unless it’s the type of investigation where they break down your door with a battering ram  the FBI doesn’t just drop by unannounced for tea on a Saturday morning.  A 3-1/2-hour interview with a presumptive Presidential nominee would have to be scheduled well in advance.  That means this was probably at least in the works when Hillary was claiming she hadn’t heard from the FBI at all  and almost certainly set in stone on her agenda when Bill Clinton just “happened” to find his way onto Attorney General Loretta Lynch’s plane for a half-hour private chat ("No photos!") just a few days ago.   But then  the Clintons always have had a unique way of showing their respect for the investigative process.

Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced new measures to make the military accepting to openly transgender soldiers  including providing medical care to assist in that area.     Carter (who  incidentally  came out of academia and never served in the military himself) dismissed critics who objected that the US military is supposed to be the world’s most effective fighting force  not a giant social welfare program  and that this will decrease military readiness.  Carter replied that any Americans “who want to serve and can meet our standards should be afforded the opportunity to compete to do so.”  Even if under the new standards  taxpayers have to cover their gender reassignment surgery.  Question: are we really that desperate for military volunteers?  In the 1940s  when we had to hurriedly draft enough men to fight an entire World War  the military still rejected those who had relatively minor physical issues.  Pardon my political incorrectness  but requiring ongoing treatment for changing your gender seems a bit more distracting from the mission than having flat feet.

Amid calls for her to recuse herself or to appoint a special prosecutor to insure fairness  Lynch announced that she will abide by whatever recommendation the FBI makes.  This is big.  As the investigation of Hillary’s State Department emails has deepened and expanded  and as every excuse she’s made has been debunked one by one  having Obama’s AG in charge of the final decision over indictment was her last major firewall.  If Lynch means what she said  then Hillary’s legal fate is no longer up to an Obama appointee but to the non-politicized career prosecutors at the FBI.   Clinton’s campaign staff must be guzzling Pepto-Bismol like it’s Perrier over this news.   What many legal experts can’t understand is how Lynch and Bill Clinton  both lawyers with extensive experience in federal investigations (from both sides!) could not have known how inappropriate that meeting would appear.  As one critic noted  the fact that there were no photos or public acknowledgement of it until a news outlet exposed it implies that they didn't want the public to find out.  And Lynch’s claim that Bill just casually dropped by for a “largely social” visit (define “largely”) to chat about their grandchildren didn’t mollify anyone (especially when his grandchildren's grandma is under federal investigation).    Bill was supposed to be Hillary’s biggest campaign asset. But once again  it almost seems as if he doesn’t want to go back into the White House  with its intense public scrutiny and unpaid “First Spouse” position  and is consciously or subconsciously sabotaging his wife’s campaign.  Either that or he just made the same assumption Hillary made that started the entire email scandal in the first place: that rules that apply to everyone else never apply to the Clintons.    Unfortunately for Hillary  we’re about to discover whether career FBI agents are among the handful of people in the Obama Administration who don’t agree with that.

At a rally at a closed factory in New Hampshire  a former worker named Mike asked for a photo with Trump.  Instead  Trump gave him the microphone and let him describe how the company made him train the Mexican workers who took his and his co-workers' jobs when the factory was moved to Mexico.  Mike says he’s “100 percent” behind Trump.  Waiting for elites in politics and media to call Mike a racist in 3…2…1…   In the meantime  watch the video here:

But the agency claims that there are 34 000 emails to search and vet for release  and they can do only 500 a month  so they need a 27-month delay to release them.  That means voters not only wouldn’t see them before the election  but they wouldn't be made public until 2018  a year-and-a-half into a President Hillary’s potential first term.    Here’s my question:  why do they have to vet them?  To remove any classified information? Can't they just assume that not even one email between Hillary  the Clinton Foundation and a private PR firm contains classified information?  After all  if it did  that should automatically disqualify her from the presidency.  Well  I guess time will tell.  Lots and lots and lots and lots of time…

If Texas were an independent nation  it would have the world’s 9th largest economy; and as you can tell from recent Supreme Court battles  most Texans feel the government in Washington has as much in common with them as an octopus does with an armadillo.    No matter what you think of the Texit idea  you might be stunned by the numbers quoted in this article by the president of the Texas Nationalist Movement.  For instance  he points out that Texas has to deal with a federal bureaucracy that imposes over 180 000 laws  rules and regulations administered by 440 agencies and commissions staffed by over 1.5 million people  nearly 90 000 of whom are paid more than the governor of Texas.  Meanwhile  each Texan gets a say in choosing only four of those federal officials (two Senators  one Congress member and the President).     Say  come to think of it  those exact same numbers apply to every American citizen  from Hawaii to Maine. Maybe instead of Texas exiting the United States  the states need to start using that tiny electoral power to make the federal government exit the states’ business.

A portion of the song was played and because of the media coverage  it became known to one of the songwriters  who subsequently sued for copyright violation.  After negotiation  the case was settled for the amount of $25 000 as reported by the Federal Election Commission. The Huckabee campaign did not admit to copyright infringement and the court did not decide any merits of the case  including the defense argument that the Copyright Act allows an exception from liability for playing a portion of a song during a "religious assembly." Governor Huckabee personally was not a defendant in the lawsuit  did not select the song being played  and was not within 40 yards of the sound board where the song was fed into the system.  Responsibility ultimately came back to Governor Huckabee  as part of the settlement  but not because he was aware of its use or approved it.  He was not aware the song would be used and he did not approve it.

Thank goodness for the three Republican commissioners who still believe in free speech and whose votes cancel theirs out.  This time  a single complaint from one disgruntled Presidential candidate was enough for the three Democrats to vote to punish Fox News.  The charge: FNC allegedly made an “unlawful corporate contribution” to seven GOP candidates by breaking the 17-candidate field up and giving those seven their own debate (the complainer apparently didn’t qualify for any air time).  The Republican commissioners (along with anybody with a functioning brain) saw giving all the candidates as much air time as possible as responsible news broadcasting  not illegal partisanship.  It’s also exactly what CNN did  but shockingly  the Democrats didn’t vote to punish them.   I’m not at all surprised to hear about this  since these were the very same FCC Democrats who wanted to punish me for soliciting illegal campaign contributions simply by making an obvious joke in the middle of a speech.

But I wonder if this poll will get the same amount of publicity?  A new Quinnipiac University poll shows Clinton and Trump virtually tied  42-40%  which is within the margin of error.  The internals are even more interesting.  They show that Clinton barely edges Trump in two categories (who would do better getting things done in Washington or if America had to send troops overseas – I assume that doesn’t include any Americans we might send to Libya).  But in other categories (creating jobs  handling ISIS  stronger leader  and being honest and trustworthy)  Trump is decisively ahead of Clinton.  Frankly  it’s hard to fathom how any major news of the past week could do anything other than make those Hillary deficits even bigger (although I’m sure she’d come out ahead on any poll of who’d make the deficit bigger).

The ads read “Celebrate Jesus” or “Jesus Is Lord.”  But suddenly  the city transit authority told him that when his contract runs out in July  it won’t be renewed because someone complained.  Plus  if they allow the name “Jesus” to appear in ads  they will also have to accept “hate messaging.”    Would someone at the Colorado Springs transit authority like to show me the part of the First Amendment that bans the name “Jesus” from appearing in paid ads on bus benches?  After that  perhaps they could show me in the Bible where Jesus (“the Prince of Peace” and history’s most famous preacher of the Golden Rule) engages in anything remotely equivalent to hate speech.     The supreme irony is that if a local mosque had tried to buy “Celebrate Muhammad” ads and been turned down  the transit authority itself would probably have been accused of promoting “hate.”  (By the way  I assume any ads celebrating Muhammad would not be illustrated. )

Here’s a quick update on what is known so far:  The death toll has now risen to 41 with 239 injured.  There were apparently three attackers who first opened fire on the crowds  then blew themselves up with suicide vests. Turkey is leading the investigation  aided by NATO and the US.  The victims include people of many nationalities  although at this point  no Americans are believed to be among them.  No terrorist group has yet taken credit  but of course  ISIS is suspected.  Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said this should serve as a turning point in the global fight against terrorism  which has "no regard for faith or values."  And Turkey’s President did not try to blame the attack on Republicans  Christians or the NRA  although we've yet to hear from our own President on that point.   Because of all the surveillance cameras in the airport  there is a lot of footage of the attack.  You can see a number of videos at this link.  Warning  it’s not for the faint of heart.

I first met Ron Miller when he was serving as Director of Veterans Coalitions for Senator Bob Dole’s Presidential campaign in 1996.  I was on the Dole steering committee and we met at a Dole event where Ron  an Arkansas native then serving as Veterans Affairs Director for the State of Georgia  introduced me to Adrian Cronhauer  the real-life soldier played by Robin Williams in the remarkable film “Good Morning Vietnam.”  Not long after  Ron moved back to Arkansas  became an active part of the state Republican party  one of my chief military and veterans affairs advisors during my time as Governor and 2 Presidential campaigns  and a great friend.  I emailed and communicated with him regularly.  In fact  he sent an article to me on June 17—just a few days ago  but never mentioned how sick he was.  When a friend contacted me this morning about his death  I was shocked and heartbroken.    Ron signed off every letter and email with the simple word  “tailwinds ” indicating his best wishes that the winds would be at my back.  He would know something about tailwinds and headwinds—he spent most of his 20 distinguished years in the military as a combat helicopter pilot in Vietnam.  Like so many of those who served with great valor and sacrifice in Vietnam  he was underappreciated for his service.  He didn’t return bitter at the treatment of Vietnam vets.  He was the most positive  cheerful  and optimistic person one could meet.  One would never suspect the horrors of war that he had seen and experienced  nor realize the raw courage he exhibited in his war time service.  He was a consultant in a movie in development called “Perfume River” which I hope makes it to the big screen  mainly because I hope America will never forget those who served in Vietnam against all odds.    I loved Ron.  I miss him already.  I wanted to share with you the biography that was prepared by his alma mater  Arkansas State University  which named him a Distinguished Alumni  and for whom a scholarship is named.  Please read it and remember why we are free today.  Ron M. Miller  Major  The Distinguished Flying Cross    Ron M. Miller was born 20 January 1938 in West Ridge  Arkansas. He graduated in 1959 from Arkansas State University with a BSE degree. Between 1955 and 1960  he earned additional hours from University of Southern California and Arizona State University. His military career spans 20 years  beginning in 1960. Military awards include two Distinguished Flying Crosses  two Meritorious Service Medals  21 Air Medals  two Bronze Stars  three Army Commendations  Paratrooper  Master Army Aviator  Korean Government Medal  Vietnamese Government Service Medal  and Medal of Honor 1st Class.  He is being honored for his two Distinguished Flying Crosses. The first Distinguished Flying Cross was awarded 30 November 1966 for heroic action 5 November to 11 November 1966. During this period  the then CPT Miller was serving as gunship leader for his company while participating in Operation Attleboro in support of the 1st Infantry Division in Vietnam. While continually under devastating hostile fire  Captain Miller led his unit in flying 1 916 sorties over a period of 61 hours. During this time  3 700 infantrymen were inserted into strategic landing zones throughout the vast area of tactical operations. CPT Miller's unit also delivered 200 tons of emergency re-supply material into combat landing zones. Missions were conducted under difficult weather conditions and often in total darkness. Despite long  arduous flying hours  CPT Miller skillfully maneuvered his aircraft until completion of his mission. Dur to his superb leadership  all missions were completed with no casualties or loss of aircraft.  The second Distinguished Flying Cross was awarded 30 June 1967 for heroic  voluntary action above and beyond the call of duty 12 October 1966. CPT Miller distinguished himself while serving as fire team leader in direct support of C and C Detachment  Phu Bai Special Forces camp when the Viet Cong attempted to penetrate the camp's perimeter during the evening meal. When the attack began  he made his way through automatic weapons and mortar fire to trenches surrounding the camp. Returning enemy fire  stopping the Viet Cong  he began moving toward his armed helicopter. He left the protection of the trenches and raced through the raging battle. Organizing his fire team  he maneuvered his aircraft through intense fire to a re-arming area 3 000 meters away. He continued placing himself in positions of danger as he remained in the battlefield drawing fire away from the beleaguered Special Forces. His actions in both incidents were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself  his unit and United States Army.  I can only think of one thing more to say to my devoted friend and dedicated soldier  “TAILWINDS  Ron!”  You have earned them.

But in fact  there is a very deliberate strategy behind it  one that was laid out in a 2004 book called “The Management of Savagery” by Abu Bakr Naji.  It’s been called “the ‘Mein Kampf’ of jihad.”  If you want to know what the goals  strategy and endgame of ISIS are all about  read this article on that book.  I would strongly suggest that President Obama read it  too  if he can force himself to consider that there might actually be an element of radical Islamism in ISIS.

PG&E had hoped to negotiate a 20-year extension for the Diablo Canyon nuclear generator  but these days  the state is largely run by unelected environmental extremists.  So it will be shut down at a cost to consumers of tens of billions of dollars  not to mention the rising costs of trying to replace the power it generates with “renewable sources” such as solar  and in a time when the state is dealing with both record energy demand and recurring brownouts and blackouts.  And forget meeting the demand with coal or gas-produced energy: the same environmentalists have banned coal from California and blocked any new gas pipelines.     The article at the link makes an interesting case that this is exactly the kind of “let ‘em eat cake” dictatorial elitism that drove the UK to vote to exit the EU.  So will Californians finally get fed up with elitist environmentalists crippling their economy and turning out their lights and call for a referendum to take power back from the green lobby?  If not  that would leave Californians with only one “Brexit”-style strategy  which is to exit California  which they’re already doing in droves.

It will be interesting to see the reaction in San Francisco  probably America’s most liberal  gay-friendly city  as residents start to wake up to the fact that the same weak  politically-correct  multi-cultural  morally-relativist leftist government they worked so hard and donated so much money to elect has now let our enemies grow strong enough to start targeting them.

Maybe this will finally get Obama Administration officials to overcome the implicit bias that makes them treat all law-abiding conservative gun owners as terrorist threats who need to be harassed by the IRS.

The clarification is that it’s not a ban on all Muslims  just on immigration from nations that are hotbeds of anti-American radicalism until immigrants can be properly vetted.  Note  this is not a change.  That was always his policy  but it’s been falsely reported as a “ban on all Muslims” so many times that to make it abundantly clear  he’ll no longer even use the word “Muslim” to describe these nations.     Whoever imagined that Trump’s problem would be that he just isn’t plain-spoken enough for some people to comprehend?

It’s the kind of case where nobody wants to defend the plaintiff  since he was convicted of domestic violence.  But his attorneys were challenging gun laws that categorized misdemeanor domestic violence  even “reckless” rather than intentional violence  as equal to a felony in banning a citizen from ever again having the right to own a gun.  The Court allowed such lifetime bans to stand by 6-2.  But in his dissent  Justice Thomas argued that this gives far too much power to politicians and prosecutors  pointing out that Americans could be accused of misdemeanor reckless domestic assault and lose their Second Amendment rights for life  simply for causing slight injuries to a family member by texting while driving. I'm sure that's a good enough rationale for many gun control advocates  and it probably won’t bother many liberals in the media  either.  Although if reckless writing could cost you your First Amendment rights forever  maybe they’d see the problem.

The case involved Virginia’s former Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell  who  along with his wife Maureen  was convicted of corruption for receiving $175 000 worth of gifts  ranging from a ball gown to a Rolex watch  from a diet supplement manufacturer.  The gifts themselves were legal  and the businessman never received any state support.  McDonnell argued it wasn't a bribe to accept gifts if it didn’t affect what he would have done anyway.  The jury and lower courts didn’t buy that  but the Supreme Court allowed both McDonnells to stay out of jail pending appeal  and now their convictions have been vacated and sent back to a lower court.  They could still be in trouble  depending on how the law is eventually interpreted  but this unanimous ruling sets a precedent that bribery of public officials requires more than just accepting gifts; something must be done in return that otherwise wouldn’t have been.    Some of the immediate repercussions include a possible chill on the Obama Justice Department’s allegedly politically-motivated prosecutions of public officials who oppose them (such as New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez)  and of course  the investigation of the Clinton Foundation.  The Clintons can now argue that all the millions of dollars in donations from shady sources did not constitute bribery because the things they did in return that appeared to be induced corruption they would have done anyway   just out of general  longstanding corruption.

You can hear the interview at the link below.  When I was in New York last week  Tanto saw me in a restaurant and came over to say hello.  As always  it was an honor to speak to a genuine American hero.      In a related story  the House Select Committee on Benghazi submitted a series of questions for President Obama on his Administration’s shameful failure to respond to the terrorist attack on that deadly night in 2012.  But the White House refused to answer any questions  dismissing them as a partisan attempt to make the Obama Administration look uncooperative ahead of the election.  Because nothing makes a politician look cooperative like refusing to answer any questions.

It was the most hilariously hypocritical comment since the moment in “Casablanca” when the corrupt police official declared that he was “shocked” to discover there was gambling at Rick’s Café  just before pocketing his winnings.  As usual  Donald Trump had a blunt rapid response  and good luck to the liberal media in trying to debunk it:

Elizabeth Warren may have morphed from a Hillary critic to a leading contender for her running mate.  The ticket could be promoted as “Left And Lefter.”  Best quote from the linked story:  Warren said that Hillary had spent her career fighting for progressive values while Trump was in the campaign to bolster his financial bottom line.  She called Trump “a small  insecure money grubber who fights for no one but himself.”   Fact-check:  Donald Trump is putting an extremely lucrative private sector career (one that involves building things and creating thousands of jobs) on hold for a job that pays $400 000 a year  and he’s promised to accept only $1 of that salary and give the rest to charity.  Meanwhile  during their career of selfless “public service ” the Clintons have amassed a vast personal fortune based on speaking fees from corporations and wealthy Wall Street insiders with business before Washington  as well as "charitable" donations from foreign governments that oppress women and jail or execute gays.  But then  judging from what I’ve seen from many so-called “progressives” who abuse the power of government to favor and enrich their wealthy backers  being a transparently unscrupulous influence peddler IS a hallowed “progressive value.”

Opponents of the laws argued that they restricted access to abortion by forcing abortion clinics to be sanitary and medically safe  a strange argument indeed for people who loudly proclaim themselves to be advocates for “women’s health.”  In ruling in their favor  the Justices decided that they are not only legislators  they’re now doctors  too  finding that medical complications from abortions are rare and rarely dangerous.  And if you happen to be one of those “rare” patients who suffers dangerous complications  you’re on your own.  Dr. Kermit Gosnell must be looking at this Court and dreaming of an appeal.       In a stinging dissent that he read from the bench  Justice Alito stated  “The Court’s patent refusal to apply well-established law in a neutral way is indefensible and will undermine public confidence in the Court as a fair and neutral arbiter.”  Justice Thomas concurred  writing  "The Court has simultaneously transformed judicially created rights like the right to abortion into preferred constitutional rights  while disfavoring many of the rights actually enumerated in the Constitution. But our Constitution renounces the notion that some constitutional rights are more equal than others...Unless the Court abides by one set of rules to adjudicate constitutional rights  it will continue reducing constitutional law to policy-driven value judgments until the last shreds of its legitimacy disappear."   Frankly  that ship has already sailed.  It’s long become obvious that this Supreme Court cannot be relied upon to protect and enforce the Constitution.  If Americans don’t want the United States to be a land where the rule of law depends entirely on the personal whims of unelected lawyers in black robes and where the Constitution is hardly more than a suggestion  they need to elect political leaders on every level who will put the Constitution ahead of their own political agendas.  And of utmost importance  they must never allow Hillary Clinton to fill the late Justice Scalia’s seat (and maybe more) on the SCOTUS or appoint dozens of leftwing activists to lower courts.

Another dozen refused to respond when asked if they own guns.  Still  when it comes to hypocrisy  it’s hard to beat Rep. John Lewis  who led the fight to ban Second Amendment rights for everyone on the federal no-fly list  despite having once been mistakenly put on it himself  so he’s well-aware of how unreliable it is.

That claim has long been dismissed by liberals as paranoia (along with the obviously false claim that “nobody wants to take away all guns!”)     Well  one of our most liberal states  President Obama’s home state of Hawaii  just pulled the trigger  so to speak.  Friday  Democratic Gov. David Ige signed a law requiring all gun owners in the state to be entered into a federal database.  It’s supposed to keep track only of “people of trust ” such as teachers and school bus drivers.  But now  every gun owner in Hawaii  regardless of occupation or lack of criminal record  will be recorded by the federal government.    Opponents of the law call it an “extremely dangerous” Big Brother-style law that sets up all gun owners for federal tracking and future gun confiscation.  The NRA says that innocent citizens shouldn’t be subjected to federal suspicion and monitoring just for exercising a basic constitutional right.    I would make the obvious analogy here – “How would the media react if the government started monitoring citizens just for exercising their First Amendment rights?” – but how many Americans believe that they aren’t already?

It’s not a surprise; candidates of both parties often endorse their opponents after saying awful things about them during primary season.

By the time I got up a little after 6am  the news was already rocking the world—the UK voted to get OUT of the EU by the very 52-48 margin by which they were predicted to lose. It can’t be argued that it was decided by a small sampling—a huge 72% of the Brits voted.   A little while later in the morning  Prime Minister David Cameron announced his resignation.  The stock markets around the world plunged  and the British pound dropped by its greatest dip in 40 years.  (Good thing I brought some US currency to trade!) Cameron was leader of the Conservative Party  but it was members of the Conservative Party who pushed for withdrawl.  Cameron sided with the Labour Party and the institutions of government and finance.  The majority of the people  including a significant number of Labour Party people  voted to get OUT.   Why does this matter to YOU in the USA?  Because it was a foreshadowing of what will likely happen in November.  Those who lead the political and financial institutions will push strongly that we “go along” our path and elect “Hellary” Clinton.  There will be a large number (I believe a majority) who in spite of the uncertainty of specific policies  will vote to kick the political and financial institutions in their wide and arrogant rear-ends.   The votes in the UK to get OUT of the EU were those of workers tired of seeing their jobs taken by immigrants who didn’t share the British tradition  culture  and spirit.  Many of our neighbors across the pond have felt they were losing their country and culture and that unrestricted immigration was changing their nation.  It didn’t help that those wanting to stay in the EU branded the “out” group as racists or xenophobes.  It was that many long time subjects of the British empire felt that their country was being lost to those who came to claim “free” benefits  jobs and education  but who also wanted to ignore what made the UK a great country and economy: its commitment to a moral authority and the rule of law and order. Sound familiar?   This debate has deeply divided the UK  just as America has become deeply divided over essentially the same issues of nationalism vs. globalism.  I’ve been speaking out about this for years—that America can afford to welcome immigrants who want to assimilate into America  but CANNOT afford to lose its culture and country to those who have no intention of speaking English  accepting the American Constitution of fundamental rights of the individual and of private property  and the moral authority based on the Judeo-Christian tradition.   Some in the ruling Conservative Party  like Cameron  had become more of the “house cats” of the ruling class.  They defended multi-culturalism  unbridled immigration policies  and the siren song of globalism.  Blue collar workers and some of the deeply traditional and patriotic British leaders (like Nigel Farage and former London Mayor Boris Johnson) led a revolt against the trend and a move toward a return to a unique and independent United Kingdom. There is much hand-wringing and panic in the halls of government and finance in the UK.  The truth is  no one really knows what will be the result of the UK getting out of the EU.  But our friends the Brits determined that what they DID know was that if things kept on the way they were going  their grandchildren would live in a UK that wouldn’t resemble the one they loved and lived in.   Listen carefully to the US politicians who speak of doom and gloom about the British vote.  Expect some of the GOP like Paul Ryan and other institutionalists tied to the financial empires to join with Democrats to call the vote “racist  short-sighted  and dangerous.”  And watch them in November when they get their own comeuppance by an American people tired of watching their jobs disappear to other countries  the middle class getting sucker-punched and losing net worth while the globalist financiers made billions anyway  and while the best answers from the so-called conservative leaders were slashing Social Security and Medicare  gutting the basic constitutional rights of citizens to protect their jobs and their property  and pretending that there is no moral authority for our government. A big shock in the UK; a big lesson and something to watch for in the United States.

Curiously  in 2014 the Court in a 6-2 decision upheld a Michigan law banning race as part of the admissions criteria.  Michigan is one of eight states currently banning race-based admissions.  The inconsistency puzzles Justice Sam Alito  too  as he made clear in his dissenting opinion.   But Justice Anthony Kennedy  writing in his majority opinion  said that the University of Texas had met its burden of showing its admissions policy was “narrowly tailored” (?) and that such policy was consistent with equal protection.   Sadly  we’ve gotten so used to policies that fight racism with more racism that we can actually look at “race conscious” admissions policies as consistent with equal protection.

Authorities say that he had already been searching stores and online for components to build a pressure cooker bomb  like those used by the Boston Marathon bombers  for an attack in his home state of Indiana.  Interestingly enough  he’d first come under scrutiny by the FBI after he posted videos online of Anwar al-Alawki  the same radical Islamic cleric who was in touch with Fort Hood mass shooter Maj. Nidal Hassan (perpetrator of “workplace violence ” according to the Obama Administration) and whose videos were watched by Orlando mass killer Omar Mateen (homophobe and gun owner with no particular religious motivations).     This arrest shows the importance of actually keeping tabs on people who land on terrorist watch lists and paying attention when someone starts promulgating violent jihadist rhetoric.  Instead  I expect Democrats to respond by holding a sit-in to demand mandatory background checks for every purchase of a pressure cooker at Williams Sonoma.

Everyone wants to prevent such a horror from recurring  but rushing to “do something  even if it’s wrong” is not the way to go about it.  The Senate measures sounded reasonable on the surface  but didn’t hold up to scrutiny.  For instance  one would have given the Attorney General unprecedented power to deprive Americans of their Second Amendment rights without clear justification.  Another was praised by Harry Reid for closing the “terror loophole ” which doesn’t actually exist.  You can read more about the reasons for the bills’ failure at the link.

You just might make someone who was there in the middle of the action very  very angry.   A couple of weeks ago  one such Hillary apologist appearing with Tomi Lahren on The Blaze said that all Democrats and even the families of such victims as Ambassador Chris Stevens were “sick of his death being used by the right wing as a political ploy.  It’s disgusting.”   A week later on the same program  someone else expressed his disgust at the exploitation of victims’ families for political gain  but he wasn’t talking about the right wing doing it.  He was talking about Hillary’s minions doing it.  And it came from a visibly upset Kris “Tanto” Paronto  who was on the ground at Benghazi as others died while waiting for help that never arrived.  Paronto wanted a face-to-face conversation with the Hillary surrogate (as if that would ever happen).  He called Hillary’s defenders “worthless” and went on to say that “these kinds of people need to stop procreating  period.”   Oh  there was much more.  Click here for the full story.

They actually tried to blame a target graphic on a map of targeted Congressional districts at Sarah Palin’s website for inciting the Gabby Giffords shooter.  Yet their reaction to Donald Trump’s candidacy has gone beyond incendiary rhetoric to outright riots and assaults on his supporters.  Now  we've reached the inevitable next step.    20-year-old Michael Stephen Sandford allegedly grabbed a policeman’s gun at a Trump rally in Las Vegas  and afterwards admitted that he had driven all the way from California in hopes of assassinating Trump.  He’d even spent the day practicing at a gun range. He reportedly expected to be killed by the Secret Service  but was willing to take that chance  although he’s not even an American: he’s from Great Britain.     So will this shame some of Trump’s more hysterical and hyperbolic critics on the left into thinking about the effect their incendiary rhetoric has on unstable people?  Will they now tone it down  denounce violent protests  and embrace a return to honest and respectful disagreement?  That’s some “hope and change” I seriously doubt we’ll see.

The host was Jonathan Karl  and his guest was Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy  who’d just staged a 15-hour filibuster to push laws expanding background checks and eliminating the mythical “gun show loophole.”     We’re all used to seeing media people put on concerned faces and nod like bobbleheads when politicians mouth this stuff.  It’s always presented in such a concerned way  and following a terrible tragedy  that it seems almost rude to point out that their emotional arguments make no logical sense.    So it’s almost surreal to see Karl keep pressing Murphy to explain why he’s responding to the Orlando attack with laws that would not have prevented it (Omar Mateen passed a background check and didn’t buy his gun at a gun show)  nor would they have prevented Newtown or Aurora or any other tragic shooting that has been politicized by gun control advocates. In the end  Murphy was reduced to hypotheticals: if these and other laws had been in effect  and if Mateen had done things differently  then it might have prevented the crime.  Maybe  but if the laws had been different  then Mateen would likely have done different things to avoid them.  So what's the real point?     The problem with trying to fight radical Islamist terrorists with gun control laws is that they not only don’t obey laws  they kill people with whatever is most effective and convenient  whether that’s a gun  a suicide vest  jetliners or pressure cookers.  You can’t stop them by banning every tool that might be dangerous; as today’s product warning labels inform us  anything can be deadly in the hands of an idiot.  The sad fact that gun-grabbing politicians and celebrities refuse to admit is that only one thing stops a determined attacker: an armed victim.  They won’t admit that  but one look at their 24/7 armed bodyguards tells you that in their hearts  they know it.

This comes after a month of unforced errors that caused a drop in polls  during a time when Trump should have been hammering Hillary Clinton (the damaging State Department IG report on her email scandal; confirmation that it is a criminal FBI investigation and she did send marked classified documents; the new tell-all book by a former Secret Service agent  and more).  Instead  he gave the press openings to gleefully beat up on him (not they haven’t have plenty of practice already at beating up on Republicans while ignoring Clinton scandals).    I predict that the big story now will be “Disarray in Trump campaign!”  Instead  it should be that Trump is someone who sees that if a person isn’t working out effectively  he'll bring in someone else.  How many times over the past eight years have we heard Obama voice full confidence in people who richly deserved to be fired (the IRS targeting scandal  for instance) and in some cases  like Fast & Furious and the V.A. waiting list scandal  should have been fired and relocated to the Graybar Hotel?

The smoke sickened him  the noise deafened him (it was like crashing a race car at 150 mph inside a plastic explosives factory!)  and the recoil bruised his tender shoulder (he claimed that it was like firing a bazooka – I think it’s more likely that he’s actually crashed a race car into a bomb factory than that he’s ever fired a bazooka). Overall  the whole nightmarish experience left him shaking and suffering from “temporary PTSD” (ask a veteran if such a thing exists).

You don’t have to know as little about guns as most of the people who are trying to repeal the Second Amendment to be surprised at the answer  because the media certainly don’t tell you this.

Ann Morgan Guilbert died of cancer this week at 87.  In a career that spanned decades  the comic actress played supporting roles in countless TV shows and movies.  But she was unique in scoring two parts for which she’ll always be remembered  one at the beginning of her career and one near the end.  She first came to fame as Rob and Laura Petrie’s wacky neighbor Millie Helper.  Thirty years later  looking completely different with big hair and giant glasses  she was Fran Fine’s hilarious grandmother Yetta on “The Nanny.”  Click the link to learn more about this very funny lady and enjoy clips from both of her iconic TV roles.

The argument is that they’re fighting obesity  but it also applies to diet sodas  so it’s obvious the real reason is money.  Does anyone seriously believe that tax will stay at just 1.5 cents for very long?  A group opposing the tax calls it unconstitutional and hopes to get the courts to reverse it  the way a judge blocked former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg’s ban on large sodas.     But whether the reason for the soda tax is public health or revenue-boosting  the larger point is being ignored: that it’s none of the government’s business what beverage you choose to wash down your Philly cheese steak.  No more than the IRS should have the power to make you reveal  justify and prove every purchase you make with your own money.  This all springs from the leftist mindset that society can be perfected if only Americans would let their liberal elite betters in government control every aspect of their lives.  In their minds  the money you earn isn’t yours; it belongs to the government and they just generously let you use a little of it.  But you’d better use it for things they deem proper  like drinking a kale smoothie instead of a Dr. Pepper.  Sorry  but like the kale smoothie  I find that impossible to swallow.    Besides  if the Philadelphia City Council really wanted to fight obesity  they’d put a $10 tax on Philly cheese steaks.  I actually wish they’d try that.  That would get them recalled and replaced PDQ.  Read more at the link:

He missed seeing me sworn in as Governor by 3 1/2 months.  He never met Lauren who would become his granddaughter in law  or Bryan  who would become his grandson in law.  He only lived to see one of his grandchildren (John Mark) graduate from high school  and not long enough to see any of them graduate from college.  And he never saw any of his 5 great-grandchildren (Chandler  Scarlett  Caroline Grace  Huck  or George)  but if he had  he would have been proud and would have bragged to anyone who would listen that they really were the cutest kids ever.  (and he would have been right about that!)  I will always remember that first Father’s Day after his death and not in a good way.  My world had been turned upside down by the convicction of the then Arkansas Governor and my preparing to assume the office from the position of Lt. Governor.  We were just about one month away from taking the oath  moving our family to the Governor’s Mansion  hiring dozens of people to staff the office  and trying to establish an agenda for the state budget and policies.  It was a hectic whirl of activity from early morning to late night.    Despite all the flurry of things to get done  I had not forgotten it was Father’s Day  and as had been my custom for the past 25 years or so  I picked up the phone to call him early in the morning to wish him a Happy Father’s Day.  A card and gift would be later in the day.  Without even thinking  I picked up the phone and dialed his number.  And just as it started to ring  the cold chill hit me hard as I quickly hung up and disconnected with whatever person would have been on the other side of that number because I then remembered that he wasn’t there.  I knew that  but it was sheer instinct to call and congratulate him on having such a wonderful son  and tell him I loved him.  But for a fleeting moment  it had escaped me that for the first time in my life  there was no one to call that I could call my Dad.  He was gone.  And it wasn’t a busy signal or bad connection.  He would never again be on the other end of a phone call.  No more birthdays to celebrate.  Not there for the next Thanksgiving or Christmas.  At age 40  I was now the oldest male in my direct lineage and there was no male upstream from me and never would be.  I had my two sons and a daughter  and the day would come (almost 15 years later) when there would be another generation coming along to bring some continuity to the family name  tradition  and yes  even the tempermant.    For the sons who read this today  make that call.  If you get a busy signal or voice mail  keep trying.  But make the call.  There will come a day you will try and there will be no one on the other end to hear you say “Happy Father’s Day.”  So say it today.    Happy Father’s Day.  Mike Huckabee  June 2016

But these days  something that sounds outlandish --- even unbelievable --- relating to politics may very well be true.  Sometimes it seems that the more outlandish it is  the more likely it is to be true!  And it may be backed up with some excellent reporting.   In this case  Trump makes the case that a candidate for President of the United States is being funded by terrorism and oppressive regimes.   Heated political rhetoric  you may say.  Hyperbole.  Not something to be taken seriously.  But  wait --- he’s not making this up.  After all  we’re talking about Hillary.   He’s holding up a copy of Wednesday’s New York Post.  Inside is an editorial that details the huge amounts of money Hillary has taken in  through the Clinton Family Foundation  from sharia law governments and regimes involved in terrorist activities and the persecution of gays and lesbians.  (Keep in mind  these are the people who throw gays off the tops of buildings.)  Since the Orlando massacre  Hillary has mentioned the funding of radical schools and mosques by Saudi Arabia  Qatar and Kuwait  but after taking large wheelbarrows full of cash from them herself  there’s little she’ll do other than pay lip service  and they know it.   Is this the kind of influence we want in our Presidential campaigns?  If history has taught us even one thing about the Clintons  it’s this:  they don’t care where the money comes from  because money equals power.

Like when the Obama Administration removed a judge from a case because they thought her Iranian heritage would influence her rulings  or when Justice Sonia Sotomayor implied that being a “wise Latina” influences her judicial decisions for the better.  And now  there’s this: the furor over Trump booting reporters from the Washington Post and other outlets out of his campaign pool was just reaching a thick froth  with reporters accusing Trump of taking a pickax to freedom of the press.  Then someone did a record search and discovered that back in 2009  candidate Barack Obama booted reporters from three outlets – the Dallas Morning News  New York Post and Washington Times – off his press plane right after the papers endorsed John McCain.  The reporters had been flying on that plane for months  but the Obama campaign claimed there suddenly just weren’t enough seats for them.   So maybe  when it comes to outrageous and self-serving behavior  the real difference between Trump and Obama isn’t so much the behavior  but the excuses and the media coverage.

But if anyone has managed to transform Twitter into a rival to the established political media  it’s Donald Trump.  So the data firm Stirista decided to analyze Trump’s massive Twitter following.  You might be surprised at what they found.  It could signal a big change in the way election turnout is determined.

Well  according to the classic musical South Pacific (written in the aftermath of World War II)  “…to hate all the people your grandparents hate  you have to be carefully taught.”   Sometimes  hate is taught by one’s grandparents  or parents.  Sometimes  hate is taught through Facebook postings and Tweets.  Other times  an imam in a mosque might teach it.  More specifically  Dr. Sheikh Farrokh Sekaleshfar has definitely taught it  while giving a talk at the Husseini Islamic Center in Sanford  Florida  in 2013 about the “compassion” (translation:  hate) that good Muslims should show to homosexuals.   According to the esteemed doctor  the way to show compassion towards gay people is to kill them.   I am not kidding.  According to this Iranian scholar’s warped faith  death is the only way that gays and lesbians can be forgiven in the eyes of Allah.  “We have to have that compassion…let’s get rid of them now ” he said.   So the Orlando terrorist was just doing his victims a favor!  You’ve heard of a “twist of fate” --- I call this a “twist of faith.”  Click here for the full  twisted story.

Yet he still couldn’t bring himself to say “radical Islamic terror ” even though the killer pledged allegiance to ISIS and ISIS took credit for the attack.

Obama actually stated that “we need the strength and courage to change” our attitudes toward the LGBT community. As if tens of millions of bigoted Americans gunned down the victims in Orlando.

The latest news I’ve received is that the death toll at the gay nightclub Pulse has reached 50  with 53 wounded.  That makes this deadliest mass shooting in US history.  The shooter was killed in a shootout with police.  Please join me in praying for the victims and their families  and that the wounded will recover and there be no more casualties.    The link below has a recap of what happened if you’re just getting up on Sunday morning and hearing the news.  The killer was identified as Omar Mateen  a US citizen of Afghan heritage from Port St. Lucie  Florida.  Police say he entered the crowded dance club at 2 a.m.  well-organized for an attack and carrying a semi-automatic rifle.  It’s being treated as a radical Islamic terrorist attack.  Authorities are usually hesitant to say that so early in an investigation  so there must be some pretty strong evidence.  President Obama has been notified and is receiving regular updates.  I am keenly interested to hear what he will say.    Obama  of course  has become famous for refusing to call obvious acts of Islamic terrorism  such as the Ft. Hood shooting and the San Bernadino shooting  by their accurate names. Western nations have opened their borders and kowtowed to radical ideologies in the name of political correctness and multiculturalism  and we are seeing the deadly results in Europe and now here in America.  How many more tragic attacks will it take  in Europe  Israel and now in America  before self-hating liberal leaders wake up to the fact that radical Islam is a deadly menace  incompatible with Western values?  News flash: there is a real war on gays and women  but it’s not Republicans who are waging it.  And instead of the hate behind this vicious slaughter  we’ll probably hear more lectures about the firearm.

Naturally  Warren also leaped on the leftist bandwagon by calling Donald Trump a “loud  nasty  thin-skinned fraud.”  Which I guess is payback for him calling her a fraud for claiming to be Native American to advance her academic career at the expense of real Native Americans.

To hear her tell it  keeping all her State Department correspondence on her own server and staying “outside” the departmental system was no big deal and everybody knew about it.   But look more closely at the emails that have been released  and it’s easy to see that this is a very big deal indeed.  Though many of the classified ones could be released only after being highly redacted  each redaction came with its own code to explain why the redaction had been made.   The redaction code “B7(F)” appears on some of the pages that we can see only in blacked-out form.  This code is placed on information that  if released publicly  would “endanger the life or physical safety of an individual.”  In other words  if this information gets out  people can die.   Hillary Clinton’s desire to operate in secret is apparently so important to her that she’s willing to risk other people’s lives.  Click here for more.

Renee Ellmers became the first Congressional Republican of 2016 to lose her primary.  Much will be made of the fact that she was an early Trump endorser  and Trump endorsed her in return.  But her problems went far deeper.  Her original Tea Party supporters felt she had betrayed them  and redistricting gave her another Republican incumbent  Rep. George Holding  as a rival.    But as this story notes  the really newsworthy thing about her loss is that despite the media declaring this the year of pitchfork-waving voters and insurgent outsiders  very few down-ballot incumbents and only one Republican so far have actually lost their primaries.

Three people are dead  at least five injured  some seriously.  At last report  two shooters disguised as Ultra-Orthodox Jews had been captured.  They are reportedly Palestinians and members of the same family.  Police were still searching for a possible third shooter (that may change at any second).  Bomb squads are searching the area to make sure they didn’t leave behind any explosive devices.  It’s not yet clear if any organized terrorist group is behind the attack and there was no specific warning -- although Hamas had put out a generally threatening Tweet for Ramadan and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh tweeted out victory congratulations to the killers of innocent shoppers.  That should tell you all you need to know about Hamas and about anyone who seriously thinks they can be negotiated with.     Is it any wonder  with US leadership shunning Israel and loosening nuclear restrictions on her enemies  that Prime Minister Netanyahu is seeking a closer alliance with Russia?  Vladimir Putin may be an iron-fisted tyrant  but at least he knows a mortal threat when he sees one.  Sadly  that can no longer be said about America’s current leader.

But her speech was more of a rambling laundry list of talking points  veering from the history of feminism to attacking Donald Trump to praising Bernie Sanders and appealing to his voters to come over to the Dark Side  to promising to bring back good-paying jobs without saying how  to vowing to get unaccountable money out of politics (has there ever been a worse spokeswoman for that cause?) and so on. As for her claim that “We have a prosperity that lifts everyone who has been left out ” I’d sure love to know where that’s happening.  There were also the usual cliché attacks on Republicans (“Make America Great Again” means we want to turn back the clock to the days of racism and sexism) and another slam at Trump for attacking reporters for asking tough questions.  That’s particularly ironic coming from someone who hasn’t held a press conference this year (and it's June already) and whose last informal Q&A lasted all of eight minutes and didn’t include a single non-puffball question.

Hillary beat Bernie big in California and New Jersey  but in an omen that must be rattling the DNC  her vote totals were down since 2008 by 30% in California and 13% in New Jersey.  Also worrisome for Hillary: Sanders vowed to keep fighting right through the convention. But it’s questionable how much fight is left in Bernie (he'll now be under heavy pressure from party bigwigs to play ball  and after a surprisingly weak showing in California  he reportedly plans to lay off at least half his staff today – a move downplayed by his campaign as routine downsizing near the end of the primaries).

He just revealed to People magazine the stunning story of why he is so successful today on both the personal and professional levels  and why he works so hard to help others in need and to mentor young men to be good fathers.  It all dates back to a time when he was at his lowest point  twice-divorced  homeless and sleeping in his car for three years.

But this isn’t the first time Secret Service agents have been less than secretive about what they experienced during the Clinton years.

As recently as a few weeks ago  they were blaming it on “a glitch.”   But now they’re saying a specific request was made to edit out the clip --- not that they know who made the request or why.  The individual who took the call has no memory of that  darn it.  But the story is that it came from someone in Public Affairs.  Perhaps that was Winston Smith  from the Ministry of Truth.   There were no rules governing this sort of thing at that time  so no investigation will be done  according to State Department spokesperson John Kirby.  “What matters to me ” he continued  “and I take it seriously  is our commitment to transparency and disclosure.”   Right.

It’s a lovely city  but apparently  Democratic Mayor Sam Liccardo thinks that the targets of violent crime are to blame for it  and the police won’t get involved to stop assaults unless they think the victim’s death is imminent.   How else to explain the official reaction to the mob of violent leftist protesters outside a Donald Trump rally last Thursday whose barbarism included physically assaulting Trump supporters?  Mayor Liccardo was quoted by the AP as saying  “At some point  Donald Trump needs to take responsibility for the irresponsible behavior of his campaign.”     Uh  Mr. Mayor?  It wasn’t the Trump campaign that was burning American flags  throwing eggs and bottles  and gang-assaulting innocent people for wearing Trump T-shirts.  Liccardo is a bigtime Hillary supporter  but even Clinton spokesman John Podesta knew where to place the blame for this  saying  “Violence against supporters of any candidate has no place in this election.”    MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes echoed that.  He called the protesters’ behavior “despicable mob violence ” said “people have a fundamental right to attend a political rally ” and called on the perpetrators to be identified and prosecuted.    So why did the police just stand by and let thugs run wild?  Did California environmentalists bar them from cutting down trees to make billy clubs?  Actually  San Jose Police Chief Eddie Garcia praised the officers on hand for their “discipline and restraint” in not getting involved in confrontations that weren’t life-threatening.  So the minimum requirement for the police to intervene in stopping an assault in the streets is that it must appear to be potentially lethal?  I wouldn’t put that in the tourism brochures.

At least  I assume that’s the case  since local sheriff’s deputies have nothing better to do with their time than visit the home of a Desert Rose Elementary School student and warn his parents that he isn’t allowed to share with fellow students the notes with Bible verses on them that his mom puts in his lunch bag.  Good thing she didn’t put any angel food cake or hot cross buns in his lunch  or the kid might have been hauled to the slammer.

I thought  "Gee  these are a lot like the kind of thing Donald Trump says!"  So I did some research and came up with quite a few quotes that sound like something either of them might say.  Then I made up this little game!  Seems to me it might go viral...  IN HONOR OF THE LATE  GREAT MUHAMMAD ALI  here’s a fun game to play!

He was the author’s Uncle Charlie Clarke  the oldest living confirmed veteran in the US.  Strangers who passed this smiling  humble everyman would never imagine his military background as part of the Red Ball Express  a unit of the 9th Armored Division in World War II that risked death delivering supplies to the front lines at a time when black soldiers were barred from fighting there.  His story is a panorama of over a century of historic milestones  from childhood in the segregated Virginia of the ‘teens to seeing his mother become one of the first women to register to vote  from his heroic war service to facing a different foe when he drove a school bus during the early days of desegregation  and finally being awarded a medal for his World War II heroism by America’s first African-American President.  All that plus some great stories and a diet tip that men will appreciate.  Click the link to read this much-deserved salute.

Peggy lived in Minnesota and is well known to the “inner circle” of supporters from the campaign.  Peggy gave countless hours of service to our effort—making calls  emailing  working social media as effectively as anyone I’ve known  and just being one of the most solid encouragers I’ve ever known.  In the circle of our team  we are like family.  While there are always the hateful trolls who post mean  vile  and absurd things  such drivel is overshadowed by the gracious and kind servants of heaven who love God  their country  and their families.  Peggy was such a person who gave us all an example of being a true lady and the picture of class.    Janet and I  along with our entire family and our team of both staff and volunteers from the campaign  mourn her death  but we celebrate “a life well lived.”  Our prayers go out to her wonderful family.  We loved Peggy and we will miss her.  Mike Huckabee

But the Internet has been lit aflame by animal lovers furious at the parents for allowing the situation to happen.  They’ve reportedly received death threats and demands that they be prosecuted.     But animal expert and TV host Jeff Corwin points out that it’s nothing new.  One study showed that 42% of deaths and injuries from captive tiger attacks involved visitors  many of them kids  and not zoo keepers.  He has an important message for all zoo visitors  especially parents:    “When you go to these places  the zoo is not your babysitter. You have a responsibility.”   I wonder if our constant immersion in TV  movies and virtual reality is making people forget how to behave in “real” reality. The same obliviousness that allows people to yak on cell phones in Broadway theaters just as if they’re sitting at home in front of their TVs is also leading them to assume that real zoo animals are no more dangerous than those in a video game.  In real reality  you don’t get to press the Reset button for an endless number of lives.        Read the full article for some possibly life-saving tips for your next real trip to the real zoo.

Latest case in point: the attempt to stir up fury over Donald Trump telling a Washington  DC  crowd on Sunday that “this is our day and we have to be very proud of it.”  That sparked the usual Twitter mobs  spewing accusations in every direction  from Trump not knowing what Memorial Day is to him trying to claim the holiday is about himself.  You can see more of their attacks and get the full story at the link below.    I guess none of these self-appointed experts on Memorial Day realized that it’s not on Sunday  it’s on Monday.  Trump was speaking at the Rolling Thunder Run  an annual gathering of bikers to call attention to POWs and MIAs that falls on Memorial Day Weekend.  I’d say that Trump was justified in calling that “our day ” seeing as they organize it every year  and Trump was an invited participant. But even if he actually had been speaking on Memorial Day and called it “our day ” how would that be outrageous?  Of course  it’s a day for fallen US veterans  but it’s also “our day” in the sense that it’s our US federal holiday for honoring them  as opposed to South Korea’s Memorial Day (June 6) or Newfoundland and Labrador’s Memorial Day (July 1).      No wonder so many Americans are fed up with politics when that now provides an excuse to rip people apart on the flimsiest of pretexts.  Instead of using social media to attack a political opponent over a vague pronoun  all those people instead could have joined in to echo the nonpartisan message of Rolling Thunder: to remember American POWs and MIAs. Then Sunday really would have been “our day ” as in “all of ours.”

Donald Trump gave a press conference breaking down in detail the $5.6 million in donations raised for veterans groups.  And some members of the press corps essentially threw it all back in his face.  In their questioning  contentious reporters did their darnedest to take a positive thing and infuse it with suspicion and negativity.    Not surprisingly  the Clinton campaign referred to Trump’s fundraising as a “stunt.”  I guess we shouldn’t be surprised  either  whenever some members of the media do everything short of wearing “Hillary For President” buttons to show disdain for the presumed Republican Presidential nominee.  Trump responded to their pit-viper attacks by calling some of the reporters “losers.”  Then they got even more contentious  and Trump defended his actions.  His last comment before leaving the stage:  “I find the press to be extremely dishonest.  I find the political press to be unbelievably dishonest.”   Trump himself donated $1 million to the Marine Corps-Law Enforcement Foundation.

The news media are filled with features about the military heroes  famous and humble  who gave their lives across more than two centuries to secure our rights and freedoms and to protect and defend the victims of tyranny all around the world.  Yet it's depressing to see also so many stories involving disrespect and desecration of veterans' memorials (let's hope the one involving the crosses in Kentucky was an accident and not deliberate).  The linked story compiles several.   In recent years  political agitators have been disturbingly successful at separating Americans into groups and pitting us against each other.  So it makes sense that they would especially hate what those military heroes stand for: the long  proud tradition of Americans from all backgrounds selflessly coming together in the common defense of the principles that made America a beacon of hope for oppressed people around the world. These men and women are history's greatest examples of putting your personal differences aside for a higher purpose.  And the ones honored on those veterans' memorials made the ultimate sacrifice by laying down their very lives for others.     But I have a feeling that the tail may have wagged the dog a little too vigorously.  Just as in 1968  the in-your-face defiance of America's traditions of honor and civility has become so egregious  you can almost feel the righteous fury of the vast majority of Americans rising like heat off the prairie.  The manufacturers of American flags feel it: USA Today reports that flag sales are up 15% from last year.  One flag maker said it's not just because it's an election year: “Most importantly  we feel there’s a rise in patriotism.”      Let's hope he's right.  The anti-American forces may have loud media megaphones  but that are a tiny bunch indeed compared to those who still believe in American principles and honoring those who protect them.  Maybe if we all rally 'round the flag by flying ours today  our massive numbers will become abundantly clear.

The truly terrifying thing about this for the left probably isn’t that people disagree with their outrage over a football team name  but the underlying lesson that just because something is in the media constantly  that doesn’t mean that everyone agrees with it.

As much as many of us would relish seeing the Donald practice his well-honed catchphrase  “You’re fired ” on a host of VA officials  I’d first like to point out how outrageous it is that we actually have to pass a brand new law before the head of our government can fire incompetent employees.  As the IRS has shown us in recent years  there’s virtually no way to get rid of federal bureaucrats  no matter how incompetent  arrogant or corrupt they are.   You can only promote them into management  where they can sleep all day and not do as much harm.

But someone tell the VA to stop rushing the memorials for veterans who are still alive.    A Wall Street Journal report found that over the past five years  the Veterans Administration has mistakenly declared more than 4 000 living veterans to be deceased and canceled their benefits.  One vet was declared dead  brought back to life  then mistakenly declared dead a second time (no  his name wasn’t Jesus).  He had to get his Congressman to contact the VA and convince them that he was still alive (they wouldn't take his word for it?)    I guess these veterans are supposed to be grateful that they only got put on the VA’s list of the living dead.  Unlike the VA waiting lists for treatment  people on that list can be brought back to life after they’re declared deceased

It sounds like a crazy conspiracy theory  but many top Democrats are privately panicking over polls showing Hillary already falling behind Trump (a new PPP poll shows her behind by 2 points in North Carolina)  while still struggling to beat Bernie Sanders.  A Hillary-Biden switcheroo would enable the Democratic establishment once again to thwart democracy and deny the old socialist their party’s nomination.  Biden could be untouched by the long onslaught of negative ads and snatch a victory for four more years of Obama policies.  Of course  this is predicated on the notion that a majority of voters actually want four more years of Obama policies.     A hat tip to Laura Ainsworth  a terrific retro jazz singer whose sideline is writing topical comedy for radio.  She provided some great parody songs for my former radio show  but maybe she should also be a psychic.  She’s been betting friends for over a year and a half that this exact scenario would play out.  I even mentioned on my podcast back on August 4  2015  that if Biden became the nominee  I’d owe Laura a Coke.   She may clean up.  I’m starting to feel very glad that I don’t bet cash!

It has to do with Alexander Hamilton  who  thanks to the Broadway smash hit Hamilton  is currently by far the most popular historical figure from our nation’s fledgling years.   In their zeal to rationalize their fear and loathing of Donald Trump  the #NeverTrump crowd has been quoting Hamilton from the contentious 1803 election season that gave us President Thomas Jefferson.  If you think “strategic vote-casting” is a product of the 2016 election  you sure weren’t around in 1803.  (And if anyone thinks you were around then  you need to take better care of yourself.)  Here  in part  is the quote being cited:  “…If we must have an enemy at the head of the Government  let it be one whom we can oppose & for whom we are not responsible  who will not involve our party in the disgrace of his foolish and bad measures.”   To understand what Hamilton intended  though  we have to go back to 1803.  Operating the Way-Back Machine for us today is writer Andrew Clark of the Independent Journal  who illustrates for us that context is everything.  Details matter  and the election laws at that time differed significantly from those of today.  When you click on the link below and get the whole story  you’ll understand that Hamilton’s goal was never to make his own party lose the election.

Several people have asked me whether a President even has the Constitutional authority to issue such an order to public schools or to withhold funds appropriated by Congress.     I don’t pretend to be an authority on Constitutional law  but the authors of this article are.  There are a lot of emotional arguments flying around  but this piece lays out the case  expertly and in painstaking detail  for why Obama’s unprecedented action violates “not one  but two federal laws” and how he is once again trying to short-circuit legal and constitutional limits on his power to rewrite law by fiat.

They looked in that dictionary and saw Donald Trump’s picture next to the word “victory” --- not mine  God knows  nor any of the other candidates who failed to prevail in this strangest but most important of election years.   The path to victory lies in unity  the chairmen of these committees concluded in the statement they released.  To quote  “Any other outcome is a danger to economic growth  puts our national security in peril  enshrines Obamacare as the law of the land  entraps Americans in a cycle of poverty and dependence  and undermines our constitutional republic.”   No argument there.

I believe that if you’re a Republican  then you respect the voters’ choice. But I am especially disappointed in Mitt for this latest attack. He’s not only trying to sink his own party’s presumptive nominee  but he’s factually incorrect and he’s making the same unfair attack on Trump that was launched against him in 2012.  If Mitt Romney wants to talk about taxes while showing the world what a real Republican stands for  he should stop trying to destroy the party’s presumptive nominee and instead aim his fire at a more appropriate target: the 70 000-plus-page tax code.

Anyone who remembers the ‘90s knows that whenever the Clintons seek power  it can’t happen without brigades of lawyers  teams of word-parsers  hidden evidence and time-wasting investigation.  Does anyone really want that?

His votes for the bank bailout and immigration reform made him one of the first Senators to fall to a Tea Party challenger  but even the man who replaced him  Sen. Mike Lee  expressed his condolences and respect for Bennett for his courage in fighting cancer and for spending his life “in service to others.”  In an age when politics has become blood sport and debate has degenerated into character assassination  let’s hope more politicians will be inspired by Bob Bennett’s example. He showed us that it is possible to be an effective politician and still be a fine and decent human being.

An online petition to boycott Target over the bathroom/fitting room policy has exploded to (at this writing) over 860 000 signatures.  Target’s response was to double down on the progressive potty policy.  At this rate  trans people may soon be able to use any restroom at Target simply because there won’t be anyone else in there ahead of them.

It’s because the races are all in the northeastern train commuter corridor: Pennsylvania  Connecticut  Delaware  Maryland and Rhode Island.  Polls show that Trump and Clinton are likely to win all five.  For Trump  it means he could end the day with as many as 968 delegates.  For Hillary  it means that her fait accompli candidacy will be even more accompli’ed  with Bernie’s odds of beating her going from “snowball’s chance in Hades” to “snowball’s chance in a microwave in Hades.”     Pollster Scott Rasmussen ran down the remaining 10 states for Fox News and found that if current polls are accurate  Trump could go into the convention with anywhere from just enough delegates to about a hundred short with Ted Cruz a couple hundred behind him.  The latter would mean the convention would go to a second ballot  and as they say in Texas  “Now we got us a rodeo!”  It will make for riveting television  and I advise you not to bet the rent money on any particular outcome.

Incidentally  the average American now pays more in taxes than for all three of those things combined.    But don’t start celebrating your freedom from tax slavery just yet.  April 24th was the national average for tax freedom  but it varies from state to state.  Click on the link to see exactly where your state falls in the “toiling for the government” continuum.  For instance  if you live in South Dakota  you were done paying taxes back on April 8th.  Texans and Georgians were finished on April 17th  and Floridians on April 20th.  But if you are in New York  you’ll keep on working exclusively for the government until May 11th; and in New Jersey  until May 12th.  Worst of all is Connecticut  where you’ll spend nearly 5/12ths of your work year just shoveling money down the tax hole until May 21st.   Is it any wonder that Texas  Florida and Georgia are filling up with fleeing Northeasterners?

You just decided which candidates best represented your views and checked the boxes next to their names. But this year  voters are being bombarded with polls and delegate predictions and strategic voting advice (support a candidate you don’t like to keep one you like even less from beating the one you do like  etc.)  that deciding how to vote is starting to feel like playing 3D Chess while binge-watching “Game of Thrones.”    The latest twist is that Cruz and Kasich have struck an unprecedented alliance to try to block Trump from reaching 1237 delegates.  Instead of splitting the anti-Trump vote  Kasich won’t contest Indiana while Cruz won’t campaign in Oregon and New Mexico.  It gives a new meaning to the phrase “win by losing.”  And are you really surprised at how Donald Trump reacted to the news?

It’s assumed this is due to the current push to release 9/11 documents and allow victims to sue Saudi Arabia  but there’s also Obama’s weak response to ISIS  and his enabling Iran and suggesting that the Saudis get used to sharing the neighborhood with them.

(Never mind that traditional bathroom policies are there for privacy and safety against peepers  videographers and rapists  not against transgender people.)  But the latest announcement from discount retailer Target takes the concern into a whole different realm.   In Target’s statement  all are now welcome “to use the restroom or fitting room facility that corresponds with their gender identity.”   So you’re about to give up your privacy in the dressing room  too.   It’s hard enough to maintain dressing-room privacy in this technological age  with tiny cameras that can go anywhere.  Now  any man can gain entrance to the ladies’ fitting room  just by saying he “identifies” as female.

My good friend Pat Boone  who is in the film (I played a small cameo role)  is speaking out and we should show our support.     The best way to counter religious intolerance toward Christians is not to “boycott” the offender  but “buy-cott” those who stand for Biblical truth.  I am urging believers across America to buy a ticket to God’s Not Dead 2 while it’s in the theaters.  The more successful a film like this is  the more insignificant will be the smears.  Nothing irritates the irreligious left more than when Christians are successful in getting their message out.  Below are stories about the SNL denigration of the film.  Understand  I like comedy and I like satire.  And I wouldn’t call for SNL to be “censored” because that doesn’t prove anything or make things better.   Let them say what they wish.  Let’s just stand with those who speak truth.   If you haven’t seen God’s Not Dead 2  please go. Encourage friends and neighbors to do so as well.  Post on your FB and tweet about it.

Personally  I have no problem with that  although I wonder if they realize they’re replacing one of the racist founders of the Democratic Party with a black  female  Republican gun owner.  Now comes word that in a blaze of “diversity ” the Treasury plans to redesign the $5 and $10 bills  too  covering them with an array of figures  from the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to Sojourner Truth to Eleanor Roosevelt.     I get the idea behind this  but could we also remember something that Washington finds easy to forget  and that is that money has a practical purpose.  We use it to buy things.  Outside of Washington  people like to avoid wasting it.  Remember how angry everyone was when they brought out the Susan B. Anthony dollar coin that was easily mistaken for a quarter but jammed up vending machines?  Has anyone considered how constantly changing the design of various bill denominations will make it that much harder to tell them apart and keep track of your money  or to make correct change (a lot of young people can’t seem to do that now  and money has looked the same for their entire lives)  or if vending machines will be able to identify all these new  ever-shifting bills?  This sounds like yet another attempt by DC elites to display their good intentions and social virtue without consideration for the headaches it will cause for Americans who don’t pay for everything with an American Express platinum card.

But that’s not the only case of terrorism victims seeking to sue a Middle Eastern government.

But when asked if any of that money was being spent on terrorist activities  State Department spokesman John Kirby offered these reassuring words:  “We don’t know.  We don’t have a way...We don’t have perfect knowledge of how every dollar of that is going to be spent…And we stand by what the Secretary [of State] said  that it’s entirely possible that they can use some of this funding to support terrorist networks.”    If this is an example of the type of diligence that will go into verifying that Iran isn’t building nuclear weapons  then we’re in serious trouble.  Incidentally  over the next few months  Iran is set to get another $55 billion or so.  We can only hope they don’t spend that to fund terrorism.  And I mean that literally: with this bunch in charge  hoping is literally all we can do.

Trump" to the tune of "Hail to the Chief. "   After seven defeats  Hillary Clinton finally got her big win over Bernie Sanders (58-42%) in New York Tuesday. Despite voter anger over some glaring snafus and polling irregularities  pundits say this restores Hillary’s momentum and virtually assures her nomination.  It’s amazing they can say that with a straight face  since anyone who makes a living in politics knows that the fix was in for Hillary long before the race even began.  Bernie performed a public service by making it clear to laymen just how little regard the modern Democratic Party has for its namesake  democracy.  But it’s been obvious for a while now  as Bernie racked up landslide wins while Hillary was awarded the majority of delegates  that he would have had a better chance of winning if he'd been playing cards against Penn & Teller.      On the Republican side  Donald Trump’s 60.2% win in his home state was even bigger than predicted.  But it was also news that John "I've Only Won My Home State" Kasich came in second with 25% and Cruz a distant third with just under 15%.  Those can be chalked up to uniquely New York circumstances  such as Cruz’s “New York values” slam and Kasich winning Manhattan because the few Republicans who actually live there would be considered liberals anywhere else. Still  even though Kasich has no mathematical path to the nomination (at this writing  if NY’s delegates are awarded according to the votes – always an iffy proposition -- Trump gets 89  Kasich 3 and Cruz 0  with three still undecided)  this makes it harder for Cruz to tout himself as the close-second-and-closing-in viable alternative to Trump.      If the polls are remotely accurate  within a week or so  it will become impossible for Cruz to reach 1 237 delegates before the convention.  That would leave Trump as the only candidate with a chance  but he might fall short as well.  That’s when things get really interesting (as in the Chinese curse  “May you live in interesting times.”)  Then the convention will change from a scripted and staged infomercial to an actual political convention in the old fashioned style.  AKA  a dogfight.    On the other hand  the drama  deals and intrigue could be a ratings bonanza that makes the Democrats’ predictable coronation of Hillary look like a tired rerun from the ‘90s on TV Land.  For the first time in years  voters could get to see how the sausage is made.  That’s a bad idea if you like to eat sausage  but it might be just the thing to get millions of Americans excited and involved in politics again.

I don’t expect that name to ring a bell for most of you  even if you lived in Arkansas.  But if you lived in Arkansas  you probably at least heard of “The Pie Shop” in De Valls Bluff  where for years a lovely lady we all called “Miss Mary” made the best homemade and handmade pies I’ve ever tasted in my life.  I would go out of my way when traveling in East Arkansas to go through the little town of De Valls Bluff on US Highway 70  right across the street from one of my favorite barbecue joints  Craig’s Barbecue.  I’d try to get there early before her steady stream of customers bought out all the pies.  If I wanted to make someone’s day  I knew to buy some extra pies and take them back to Little Rock and give them to friends.  When friends of mine from out of state came to duck hunt  part of the ritual was driving over to Miss Mary’s “Pie Shop” and introducing them to the little shack behind a modest home with a simple and crude homemade sign in black letters that simply said “Pie Shop.”  First-timers to Miss Mary’s would think I was playing a practical joke when we drove up.  "Are we really going to eat something made in such a place that looks like it might fall down?” they would ask.  “You better believe we are!” I would respond  and then add  because some of the most beautiful things in this life hide in places that aren’t that beautiful.”  I never introduced someone to Miss Mary’s that didn’t thank me.  Not only for the absolute best pie they had ever eaten  but for helping them to break past their perceptions of a humble  hard working  sweet lady who toiled for years in her little kitchen in a shack behind her house making pies.  I guess some people might say  “Miss Mary was an African-American lady.”  Not to me.  She was just a lady that I loved seeing and talking to  and loved even more getting my fork into a bite of her coconut pie  or (if I got there early enough) one of her fresh fried peach pies.  I wrote about Miss Mary in my book “Dear Chandler  Dear Scarlett” and thought as I mourn the loss of this wonderful human treasure  I would reprint that portion of the book.  I can only hope that she taught someone what she knew about making pies.  If not  I’ll have to wait until I get to heaven to get one as good as hers!  Here’s the section from my book  “Dear Chandler  Dear Scarlett”:  There is a wonderful lady in De Valls Bluff  Arkansas  named Miss Mary  who has a little building behind her house. it’s a humble shack with not much to it except a rather crudely hand-painted sign hanging from the side of the building that simply reads  “Pie Shop.” Miss Mary has been making pies for nearly fifty years  and out of her pie shop come the best homemade pies i’ve ever had.  i remember the first time i had her coconut pie. The meringue was so light and airy and it seemed three feet tall and the pie tasted as perfect as any pie could. But Miss Mary also makes a Southern specialty that is becoming a lost art: fried fruit pies. For the uninitiated  a fried pie is not a dessert  but a work of art. When done right  the outer shell is flaky and tastes lightly of flour  while the apple  peach  or other fruit filling is hot and gooey inside. i know this is how fried fruit pies are supposed to taste because that’s how Miss Mary makes them.  Now  i wouldn’t ask Miss Mary to teach me the “hermeneutics of rabbinical exegesis” as practiced in the time of King David. nor would I trust her to explain molecular biology or nuclear fission to me (if you ask me what molecular biology and nuclear fission are  I’ll tell you to go ask your science teachers). But if i wanted to learn how to make the most delicious  beautiful  and near perfect pies on this planet  i’d sit down with Miss Mary around her cookstove in the little building behind her house on Highway 70 and ask her to show me how it’s done. She would probably explain the art of a per- fect meringue  or the best temperature at which to cook an apple pie  or even the secret to a chocolate filling that isn’t sticky. None of this knowledge saves lives  but what Miss Mary does in her little pie kitchen requires as much skill as a surgeon and as much art as a virtuoso pianist. Yes  her pies are that good!  Maybe the surgeon’s work will do more good (especially for one’s arteries)  but i wouldn’t ask him to make me a pie. (For the record  i wouldn’t ask Miss Mary to take out my gall bladder  either!) the point is some people do work that requires more formal schooling or that pays more money or that gets them more accolades from the public. But the beautiful thing about knowledge is that there’s enough for everyone  and we all have something to teach one another.”  FROM THE BOOK  “DEAR CHANDLER  DEAR SCARLETT”  Thank you Miss Mary for years of indulgent pie pleasure!

After seven years of Obama  our defense policy contains more mush than the Cream of Wheat factory.   But Putin isn’t just tweaking Obama’s nose.  He’s sending a message to every nation that might consider standing up to Russia that America won't have their back  and he’s faking us out in case of any actual direct confrontation.

Anti-gun advocates hailed the ruling as a victory because they can continue with discovery  demanding internal documents from gun makers and sellers who had no connection at all with a deranged young man who killed people with legally-purchased guns that he stole.  It’s a victory for activist judges who ignore both the law and the Constitution when making rulings  and a victory for attorneys  who’ll keep on collecting fees for litigating a case that should have been thrown out of court.  Let’s hope the appeals court takes its job a bit more seriously before we start seeing lawsuits against GM and Ford for making cars that can kill you if some lunatic steals one and runs over you with it.

If the agencies involved actually use it to open up free market competition and innovation as he claims  then give him credit.  If they use it to impose even more regulations  that would just stifle competition and innovation.  I’m not sure anyone in this Administration has yet figured out the connection between heavy regulation  higher prices  and reduced innovation and competition.  But here’s a tip to get them started: if you want to foster real competition and innovation  end crony capitalism  in which politically-connected businesses get unfair advantages at taxpayer expense.  Unless you think the $528 million we spent on Solyndra solar panels is somehow going to pay for itself in lower light bills.

Arguments are being heard today in the SCOTUS in “US v. Texas ” the case challenging the constitutionality of Obama’s executive order to defer the deportation of millions of illegal immigrants.  The Administration claims it’s within the President’s powers to interpret laws; but the plaintiffs say it’s a violation of his oath to faithfully execute the laws and an attempt to usurp Congress' power to write immigration laws. The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against Obama.  Now  it’s being heard by the Supreme Court  which without Justice Scalia is balanced 4-4 between liberals and conservatives.     While we can usually depend on the four liberals always to vote for whatever Obama wants  the four “conservatives” include wild cards like Justice Kennedy and Chief Justice Roberts  who’ve been known to pull bizarre rationalizations out of the air to justify ratifying same-sex marriage and Obamacare  respectively.  If the Court deadlocks 4-4  the Appeals Court ruling against Obama stands  but it can’t be used as precedent and the issue could return to the SCOTUS once a replacement for Scalia is seated.     Conservatives who are threatening to stay home on Election Day (or even vote for Hillary!) if their preferred candidate doesn’t get the nomination should think long and hard about just how close we are today to having a stacked Supreme Court that would ratify an unconstitutional imperial Presidency.  And before making a kneejerk ruling  the liberals on the Court might want to consider just how much power they would be handing to a White House that might not be in liberal hands much longer.

But then they discovered that hundreds of students were meeting in a local park to share their Christian faith over lunches made by their parents.  Suddenly  some school officials decided this must cease because the food might not be compliant with school district standards for nutrition and food allergies  a rule they never imposed on any other off-site lunch location. The parents think it’s obvious they’re being targeted for their Christian beliefs  not their menu  and they’ve hired a lawyer.   Read the rest at the link  and tell me what you think below.

John Bel Edwards just issued an executive order protecting LGBT rights with exceptions for religious employers such as the Catholic Church.  But that wasn’t enough.  He also rescinded former Gov. Bobby Jindal’s “Marriage and Conscience” order  protecting religious business owners and nonprofits from being punished by state agencies for declining to participate in same-sex weddings.  Edwards declared  “This action will help to solidify Louisiana’s current reputation as a welcoming place for business and talent.”  Unless you are a business owner or talent who holds traditional religious beliefs  then prepare to be hounded into bankruptcy until you agree to violate your conscience.  For today's Democratic Party  it's not enough that LGBT rights be enacted  but First Amendment religious rights must also be abolished under the guise of redefining traditional moral standards as legally-actionable bigotry and intolerance.

A number of corporations such as PayPal are also trying to use economic extortion to impose their views on entire states like North Carolina  for requiring people to use the bathroom for the gender on their birth certificate.     Funny how highly principled these liberal stars and corporations are when they’re posturing in America  yet they have no moral issues with raking in loot from other nations with far worse records on gays and women.

By this point in the Obama Administration  all the other nations were supposed to love us.  Instead  our allies no longer trust us  our enemies openly taunt us  and our rivals alternately challenge and ignore us.  The latest aggressive act by Russian jets against a US Navy destroyer is a perfect example.  The repeated close buzzing was allowed to shut down a Polish helicopter training exercise.     Under previous Administrations  Russia would not have dared such a provocative act because they knew it would spark serious consequences.  These days  Vladimir Putin is smugly certain that he will face no consequences at all from tweaking Obama’s nose.  Some liberals will still defend this weak  “lead-from-behind” strategy as cool  calm and mature.  They’ll praise Obama’s lack of a response by saying he refused to engage in confrontation and kept the peace.    But what Putin understands is that when America ignores provocations like this  it sends a chilling message to Poland  and by extension  to every other nation on Earth: when you face aggression by Russia or some other stronger power  don’t count on America to stand with you.  Other nations want to be allied with the strongest horse  but Putin is demonstrating that America is a paper tiger.  He’s done it in Eastern Europe and the Middle East  and now  he’s doing it on the high seas.      This is nothing but a return of Russia’s old Cold War tactic: Probe with your bayonet; if you hit mush  keep advancing; if you hit steel  withdraw.  So far  all Putin has encountered is a big sack of cool mush  so he just keeps advancing.  If we ever hope to restore respect for America in the world  we need a leader with some steel in his spine who understands that calmly capitulating to bullies isn’t making peace  it’s surrendering.

And as always  “investments” means “stuff that she wants to spend other people’s money on.”     You know  I bet a lot of the people who actually earned that money would love to be able to “invest” it themselves  and in something other than a fat check to the IRS.  But liberals don’t think they’re smart enough to be allowed to do that.  So Washington will “invest” it for them.     This is a good time to remind you of humorist P.J. O’Rourke’s rule that all taxes are taken at the point of a gun: if you don’t pay  you go to prison; if you try to leave prison  they shoot you.  So before you let the government raise taxes  ask yourself  “Would I let someone hold a gun to my grandmother’s head and take her money to pay for this?”     Hand’s up  Granny  and fork over your purse!  Someone you never met needs debt-free tuition!

Kudos to Mollie Hemingway at The Federalist for tracking it down and explaining the Colorado caucus system.  However  I doubt this will quell voter anger at the way things were handled.  I’ve been a candidate and a delegate myself  many times  so I’m aware of the arcane party rules that might baffle and frustrate the average voter.  Most of the time  you can counter a losing candidate’s complaints by pointing out that the rules were long in place and everyone had to deal with them.    Still  the results have to pass the “smell test” with voters.  If they accept that it was a complicated system but everyone had a fair shot and one candidate just played the game better  they’ll abide by it.  But if they sense that the rules were set up to thwart the voters  then all the patient  detailed explanations of “this is just how we do things” won’t cut any ice.  It’s a no-win situation  like being a business owner who tells a dissatisfied customer that he’s wrong.  You might make a perfectly reasonable case  but that customer ain’t coming back.

It takes effort on a variety of fronts  of course  but one way may prove surprisingly effective.   Maybe we sue.   We make like the anti-tobacco forces of years past  and sue for damages.  Quite a bit of scientific evidence supports this idea; one study of over a million women shows a variety of severe and lasting mental health effects from abortion.  Fathers aren’t immune from damage  either.  (Needless to say  neither are the babies  but unfortunately they can’t be a part of the lawsuit.)   George Upper of Conservative Tribune says he’s not generally one to promote this type of legal action  but he cites reasons to make an exception:  “This could end the slaughter of millions of the unborn  improve the mental and physical health of women and men in this country  and save taxpayer dollars.”  He doesn’t see a downside.   What do you think?  Should we go after Big Abortion the same way liberals went after Big Tobacco?  Read the whole story and offer your opinion.

But that streak may be coming to an end  thanks to Cruz’s superior ground game and his knowledge of and ability to navigate arcane party rules to rack up delegates  as we’ve seen in Colorado  Louisiana  Indiana  and as this story details  Missouri.     A lot of Trump supporters and even non-Trump-backing grassroots voters are crying foul over Cruz’s ability to gain delegates without the support of voters.  The counter-argument is that this system was already in place  and Trump should’ve learned to work within it better.  I can personally attest that it’s nothing new.  For instance  in 2008  I won the Louisiana primary.  But since no candidate got over 50 percent  John McCain took most of the delegates  as arranged at the early caucuses  long before anyone actually voted.     This kind of delegate shuffling has long been common  but I think what suddenly has people angry is that this time  it’s different.In previous years  the party shuffled delegates to the likely winner  to help shorten the bruising primaries and strengthen the frontrunner.  This year  they’re taking delegates away from the frontrunner to try to undermine the guy who’s getting the most votes.  You can argue all day long that it’s perfectly “legal” under the party rules  and you may be right.  But to the average voter  it still smells like an outhouse full of three-day-old fish.

And his self-contradictory responses to Chris Wallace about the FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton’s unsecure email server have sparked an uproar across the political spectrum.   Click the link for the quotes and details.    Obama alternately assured us that Hillary didn’t endanger US security and that the FBI investigation is completely independent and free of political influence.  But if he’s not meddling in the investigation  how does he know what the FBI has found and that it's not incriminating?  One could also argue that since he ultimately will determine whether his DOJ files charges  simply by publicly endorsing her innocence  he sent a signal to the FBI that could be construed as political influence.    Most outrageously  Obama dismissed the seriousness of the thousands of classified emails (22 of them ranked “top secret”) transmitted over her private server.   He said  "There's stuff that is really ‘top-secret’ top-secret " and “top secret” papers that aren’t so much  just as “there’s classified and then there’s ‘classified.’”  He conveniently ignores the fact that under the law  government officials aren’t allowed to decide which documents are “classified” or “top secret” enough to protect and which ones they can ignore security protocols for.  In response to Obama’s nonchalant view of handling classified information  fugitive NSA secret-spiller Edward Snowden sarcastically tweeted  “If only I had known.”      It doesn’t help Hillary that a military prosecution was just made public in which Taiwanese-born US Naval Lt. Cmdr. Edward C. Lin is charged with espionage for passing classified documents to another nation  likely China or Taiwan.  The charges were heavily redacted (Hooray  SOMEBODY still cares about not revealing state secrets!)  so details are vague.  Under military law  an espionage conviction can bring the death penalty  although that hasn’t been carried out in decades.  Nobody is seriously comparing Mrs. Clinton’s infractions with someone who allegedly committed deliberate espionage.  But it can’t be good PR for voters to read this incredibly familiar-sounding part of the charges against Lin:     “The charge sheets say the officer wrongfully transported classified material  failed to properly store classified material and failed to report the compromise of information classified as secret."   Too bad Lin isn’t a natural-born US citizen because  apparently  the only way to do that and not be charged at all is to run for President.

So to sum up: our chief defense against aggressive rogue nations building and using nuclear weapons is the hope that they always remain as incompetent as our own foreign policy experts.

So on Saturday  Ted Cruz finished locking up all 34 of Colorado’s delegates  who have pledged to support Cruz on the first ballot at the national convention.  But if nobody gets a majority and it goes to a second ballot  those delegates can vote for whomever they wish.    Meanwhile  Bernie Sanders just won his seventh out of the last eight states  beating Hillary Clinton by nearly 56 to 44 percent in Wyoming.  Of course  this is the Democratic system  so that means they each get seven delegates.  Hey  just because one of them accomplished far more doesn’t mean he should enjoy greater rewards than the one who came in a distant second!  That wouldn’t be FAIR!   For Bernie  trying to catch up to Hillary in delegates is like playing poker when the casino is dealing your cards face up from a stacked deck.  Unless Bernie wins every remaining primary  he will likely never beat Hillary. But her repeated  often humiliating  losses to him keep hammering home just how unhappy grassroots Democrats are with the party’s anointed candidate.  She’s hoping for blowout wins in New York and California  but just in the past week  her RCP poll average lead in New York has shrunk from 34.5 to 11 points.  A year ago  she was favored over Bernie in California by 60 points; as of today  that’s shrunk to 7.

Some background: the seal features depictions of local landmarks  including the San Gabriel Mission  a historic landmark built in 1777.  It actually has a cross on it.  The cross was removed during earthquake-proofing  and during that time  it was removed from the city seal  too.  After the cross was returned to the Mission  the supervisors voted to put it back on the seal.  Because  well…it's s actually ON the building the seal depicts.  But somehow  depicting a historic mission accurately now oppresses non-Christians.     The ACLU celebrated the ruling as a victory for diversity and the First Amendment (if not history or architectural accuracy).  But does anyone want to lay odds on how long it will be before they get offended again and file another lawsuit  demanding that the seal not include a Catholic mission at all  no matter how historically important it may be?  What’s next  whitewashing over all religious figures in paintings in L.A. art museums?

Rall says these newsrooms are filled writers who display superficial diversity  such as race and gender  but they all attended the same schools and think the same way.  He also asks why New York Times writers who admitted they are out-of-touch elitists who got the story wrong still have jobs.  Of course  this is his argument for hiring more Bernie Sanders supporters  but it’s an even better argument for hiring more – or even any – conservative writers.    See?

We also want Presidents to get out of Washington occasionally and out among the governed.  And in the case of Presidents like the current one  the less time spent on the job  the better.  Plus  it’s not the First Family’s fault that they have to travel with a lot of security and staff and stay in high-end locations  which runs up costs.  So I don’t begrudge Obama any of that.

He seems to think that if it’s not an “existential threat” – that is  if terrorists aren’t capable of completely destroying America – then we can “absorb” a few attacks here and there.  That’s a lot easier to think when you and your family are surrounded by armed guards 24/7.    But ISIS isn’t the only vicious thing threatening America. There’s also the vicious circle that’s created when you have an enemy threat on one side  and on the other  a leader who’s more determined to downplay the threat than to stop it.  The more the leader ignores the threat and refuses to call it by its right name  the more emboldened those making the threat become.  For instance  Obama continues to ignore multiple polls showing that most Americans oppose letting in thousands of Syrian refugees  considering the attacks in Europe that grew out of radicalization efforts among Muslim migrants.  If he thinks that won’t happen here  then he needs to read a recent George Washington University study that found ISIS is already engaged in an unprecedented recruitment effort on American soil  especially through social media.    Just up through last fall  authorities had identified about 300 American and/or U.S.-based ISIS sympathizers on social media and 250 who had traveled or tried to travel to Syria or Iraq to join ISIS.  There were also 900 active investigations of ISIS sympathizers spread across all 50 states.  For an interactive map that shows which states harbored the most ISIS sympathizers  check out the link.

Liberal politicians and media figures called it offensive and un-American  and even Republicans distanced themselves from it.    But a surprising new poll by the Hill shows that 50% of Americans agree with temporarily halting Muslim immigration to the US  and that’s not just the half on the right.

She said she believes separation of church and state has been taken “far beyond the freedoms this country was founded on ” and that a lot of Christians are now being “persecuted for their faith.”  But the Hollywood left sneers that that’s just “fake persecution.”     It’s interesting that a group of people who are so sensitive to any slight that they invent terms like “white privilege” and “micro-aggressions” to feel guilty about discrimination that they never even realized existed  have the hubris to tell religious groups that they’re not really being persecuted so just shut up.  Can you imagine them saying that to any other group that complained of discrimination?  Perhaps they should stop pointing out the speck of sawdust in other people's eyes and notice the plank in their own (I believe that's a quote from the one book they insist on banning from schools).    To Hollywood liberals  devout Christians in Middle America are one of the last groups that it’s okay to stereotype and belittle.  Yet they wonder why movie box office continues to shrink (Variety recently reported that last year  just five films accounted for 25% of total movie revenues).  Funny  films like “Risen” and “Miracles From Heaven” seem to be doing pretty well.  Say  maybe we’ve stumbled across the key to saving Hollywood: make movies that don’t insult the audience's intelligence!

He doesn’t just live in New York  he’s marked his territory.    By contrast  the ad might remind New Yorkers that Hillary (born in Illinois  First Lady of Arkansas and DC) announced her candidacy for New York Senator the year before she even moved there.  She arrived in New York with “Hillary For Senate” stickers all over her carpet bag.     Since the NY primary election is in April  the Weekly Standard thinks this ad could also be a poke at Bernie Sanders  positioning Hillary as the real New Yorker  as opposed to the Senator from Vermont.  But as they note  Bernie’s also far more of a New Yorker than she is.  Bernie’s such a born-and-bred Brooklynite  Larry David plays him on “SNL” without even changing his accent.  I’d suggest that if Hillary wants New Yorkers to vote for her  she shouldn’t pretend to be something she’s not  like when she drops her g’s in the South.  Instead  harken back to her successful Senate run: promise New Yorkers that if elected  she’ll immediately move back to Washington.

We spend the rest of our lives learning the discipline of faith  and building the habits that get us closer to the ideal  but the ideal doesn’t come upon us like a thunderbolt.    I was reminded that we all want shortcuts—even in our faith.  But there aren’t any.  One step at a time; one foot in front of the other; one rung on the ladder at a time.    There are a lot of reasons to be faithfully connected to a Bible centered church  but one of the best reasons is to be reminded of the important truths that we can live by.  I hope you have a great day today—even if there is no “SHAZAM!”

Hillary denied taking fossil fuel company money (only money from individuals who work for fossil fuel companies) and snapped that she is “so sick of the Sanders campaign lying about me.”    This is one of those videos that take less time to watch than it takes to untangle all the misleading political-speak.  In a nutshell:  (1.) The Clinton Foundation has received millions of dollars directly from Exxon  Chevron and other fossil fuel companies.  Yes  you can argue that those weren’t direct contributions to making Hillary President  but who are we kidding?  (2.) The most effective way to skirt federal limits on campaign donations is for many individuals who work at the same company to give the maximum amount to a candidate.  For instance  Goldman Sachs didn’t give Hillary’s campaign $811 031.  But their individual employees all put together did.  To be fair  there are no fossil fuel companies among her very top donors.  It’s mostly Wall Street banks  giant law firms and media companies  like Time Warner  if that makes you feel any better.  (3.) To be really fair  I’d like to ask the fossil fuel-hating Bernie Sanders supporter how she got to that event.  Did she walk or bicycle?  Or take an evil  fossil fuel-burning automobile?  Is there no heating in her home?  Was it built and powered entirely by solar energy?  Does she use anything made of plastics or polyester?  And is she aware that much of the R&D into green energy is being done by fossil fuel companies?     Issues are more complicated than they seem when you get all your political beliefs off of bumper stickers on ’69 VW vans.  Which  by the way  run on gasoline.  And burn a LOT of oil.  Those things blow a gasket more often than Hillary does.

Once he makes up his mind to do something  he lets nothing stand in his way: not political opposition  public disapproval  new information  Constitutional limits on his powers  or even basic common sense.  For instance: once upon a time  he could make a case for shutting down the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.  He argued that it was a potent tool for terrorist recruitment  and that we could keep tabs on released detainees to make sure they didn’t pose any further threat.  But now  everyone else knows better.  Two separate studies found that Gitmo is barely mentioned in terrorist propaganda organs  and it’s estimated that up to 30% of former detainees have returned to violent jihadist activities  usually at a high level.  Even Obama’s own Defense Department recently admitted that Americans have died at the hands of released Gitmo detainees.     Any yet  despite that  Obama is still determined to vacate Gitmo before he vacates the White House.  The Pentagon just announced plans to release another dozen detainees to two separate  undisclosed countries  at least one of which is reportedly in Africa.  These 12 are among 37 already cleared for release.  They say it’s part of closing Gitmo “responsibly.” That’s rich.  How do you turns dozens of the world’s worst terrorists loose “responsibly”?     For exit music as they leave Gitmo  I’d suggest playing the old song  “We’ll Meet Again.”  Because there’s at least a 30% chance that we will.

I think we should give the White House the benefit of the doubt.

She showed incredible talent at such a young age.  As Helen Keller in “The Miracle Worker ” she became the youngest Broadway actor ever to be billed over the play’s title.  The 1962 movie version made her the then-youngest Oscar winner at 16.  She starred in her own sitcom  had hit records  was nominated for eight Emmy Awards and won three.  Sadly  like many child actors  she suffered from a bad family background and intense show business pressures.  Even while she was racking up awards  she was struggling with alcohol  pills  anorexia and depression  and was finally diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  But she overcame her problems  spoke and wrote frankly about them  and became a tireless advocate and fundraiser for mental health causes.  Whether she was playing Helen Keller or triumphing over her own demons  Patty Duke showed the world that miracles are possible.  Rest in peace.

It’s got a great cast  including Melissa Joan Hart  Robin Givens and Jesse Metcalf  a riveting script  and as good as the original “God’s Not Dead” is  I actually think this is one of the rare occasions where the sequel is even better than the original.  God’s Not Dead 2 is not a continuation of the first film  but an entirely new plot and was mostly filmed in Little Rock around my old work-place  the Arkansas State Capitol.

Brace yourself: Faycal Cheffou was a “freelance journalist” and activist on behalf of migrant rights.

Then he spent his off-hours trying to radicalize migrants and convince them to blast Belgium for real.  His recruitment efforts were so blatant that even in notoriously lax Brussels  the mayor finally managed to get him banned from a refugee center after a long struggle (during which  I bet he was probably called a racist and xenophobe numerous times).

Saturday  ISIS was driven out of the ancient city of Palmyra  where they had been slaughtering people and destroying irreplaceable antiquities.  They tortured and beheaded the city’s chief archeologist when he refused to tell them where the hidden artifacts were.  Of course  President Obama’s strategy had nothing to do with it.  Palmyra was retaken by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces with backing from Russian troops.   Meanwhile  thanks to the policies of Obama and Hillary Clinton  Libya continues to implode.  This story has details  plus notes of a meeting in Washington in January in which Jordanian King Abdullah told Congressional leaders that Obama has no clear strategy to defeat ISIS and doesn’t comprehend that this isn’t a Cold War  it’s a third world war.

President Obama used his Easter radio message to double down on his vow to bring another hundred thousand Syrian and Iraqi refugees into the US this year. Only 43 percent of Americans support him  according to a CBS poll from December.  I wonder if support is still even that high  considering a recent estimate by one Lebanese official that about one in 50 Syrian migrants in camps in Europe is a member of ISIS  and a boast by an ISIS-allied militant leader that the attacks in Paris and Brussels were just a “small rehearsal” for what they’re planning in America.      Still  Obama presses relentlessly on  rejecting even the suggestion that we prioritize Christian migrants for refugee status.  He and fellow liberals keep claiming that giving preference to refugees because of their religion is unprecedented and un-American.  Yet our immigration laws passed by bipartisan votes in Congress clearly list religious persecution as a key factor in granting refugee status.  Who is facing worse religious persecution in the world today than Christians in Syria?    What will it take to get liberals to care about the ongoing attempted genocide of Christians in the Middle East?  Do we have to classify them as an endangered species before liberals will show any concern about their extinction?

If you don’t pay close attention  you might think Brussels was the only site of Islamist suicide bombings in the past week.  But bombings in Iraq killed 25 people  and on Sunday  an apparent suicide bombing in a park in Lahore  Pakistan  killed at least 60 people and injured over 200 more.  It’s assumed the bombers deliberately targeted Christians  who were in the park with their families to celebrate Easter.  I hope you’ll join me in praying for the victims of all these barbaric bombings.   The attack in Pakistan on Christian families celebrating Easter was sick and horrific  but sadly  not uncommon.  The Christian minority in Pakistan is often targeted by Islamic radicals  just as ISIS thugs are trying to commit genocide against Christians across the Middle East.  Yes  terrorist groups have killed far more Muslims than Christians or Jews  but that’s largely because Muslims are a much greater percentage of the population. But Christians and Jews are more likely to be specifically targeted for extermination.

It must’ve been awkward for Bernie’s more strident young leftist supporters.  They had to take time out from writing Internet posts mocking the miracle of the Resurrection to write Internet posts hailing Bernie Sanders’ miraculous resurrection.    Bernie won over 70 percent in Hawaii  he trounced Hillary by nearly 3 to 1 in Washington  and he crushed her by over 4 to 1 in Alaska.  Of course  this is the Democratic primary process  so all those wins still brought him only slightly closer to her in the delegate count.  She’s still far-and-away the likely nominee.

I’ve got to hand it to Bernie Sanders: not many politicians would have the guts to call for raising taxes on everybody  even the working poor  while still spending so much that the huge federal deficit would grow even larger.  That’s the problem with “redistributing wealth”: do it enough  and before long  there’s no wealth left to redistribute.

This doesn’t officially extend 2nd Amendment rights to stun guns and Tasers  but it does show that even with four liberals and no Justice Scalia  the Court is not so willing to limit the individual’s right to own weapons for self-defense as many feared.  This case seems particularly egregious.  The woman was not only carrying a non-lethal weapon  but it was to protect her from the threat of an abusive ex-boyfriend.    The media always trumpet the bogus accusations of a Republican “war on women ” but why do they seldom ask why liberals want to take away the right of women to protect themselves with firearms  the only true “equalizer” when they face a genuine threat from larger  stronger males?

Of course  his people are already spinning furiously  claiming he meant Republican obstructionism.  Which might make sense if she were running for Congress.  Personally  I suspect this is a classic example of the “Washington gaffe ” defined as “When a politician accidentally tells the truth.”   After that fleeting moment of unintentional honesty  he immediately reverted to blaming trickle-down economics and not enough regulations for the 2008 economic implosion  and not the no-money-down  no-qualifications mortgages and the risky way they were bundled and resold  a result of policies instituted under him and Jimmy Carter.  Still  one moment of accidental truth in a Clinton campaign speech is like a daisy sprouting from concrete: a rarity worth celebrating.

After a month of intensive Islamic studies and learning what ISIS is about  he suddenly realized he didn’t agree with their ideology.  So he fled and surrendered to Kurdish forces.  Khweis told a TV interviewer that he “made a bad decision” and “wasn’t thinking straight.”  He said his message to fellow Americans is that life in Mosul under ISIS is “really  really bad.”  Well  thanks for the head’s up  but I believe most of us were able to figure that out without actually going there.

Some of the bloodier moments were censored  but it still traumatized her students. The teacher claimed she was trying to show the kids what was happening in the real world  but she made a mistake and didn’t realize the video would be that gruesome. This presents a quandary: how much of life’s ugly realities should we allow young people to see? Her students are 13- and 14-years old. They shouldn’t be exposed to brutality like that. Then again  they saw it because the teacher clicked on the wrong Internet link – something any of those kids might have done at home. We put filters on computers to try to protect our children from pornography  but how do we protect them from disgusting  violent depravity that’s being broadcast to the entire world under the heading of news? It’s sad that we even have to consider such questions. But ISIS gives us no choice. We can try to shield our children from the horrific images  but we have to let them know there’s evil in the world so they’ll be prepared and not fall prey to it. And there is such a thing as sheltering children too much. Like when even our leaders refuse to acknowledge what our enemy really is  and we let our kids live in “safe spaces” until they’re 26 years old  then they have to run away and join ISIS before they realize that it’s bad.

Even political operatives and DC insiders are citizens and voters and have every right to support a candidate or oppose one.  But the stated purpose of the meeting was to either stop Trump in the primaries  at the convention  or organize a 3rd party candidate should Trump win the nomination the old fashioned way—by getting more votes than his competitors.  A novel idea indeed—having an election and affording citizens the “one man  one vote” rule to elect their nominee.  But what if a select group of political operators don’t like the person the voters picked?  Erickson said that “WE” (emphasis mine) would get together and find a candidate to run as an independent because “WE” would never support Trump.  I was stunned at audacity of an attitude that brazenly declared that the “WE the PEOPLE” as empowered in the very preamble to the Constutition had been somehow replaced by “WE the POLITICAL OPERATIVES.”   You can see my reaction below.   I like Erick.  He’s a smart guy.  I honestly thought perhaps his strong emotions about the process had caused him to mispeak when he said “WE” (political insiders) would stop Trump no matter what the voters thought.  Translation: The voters are stupid and don’t know what’s best for them so we’ll let them pretend their votes matter  but after we humor them with the meaningless exercise of an election  we’ll pick someone that “WE” like better.  But then  in response to my comments  Erickson posted THIS on his blog:  "Mike Huckabee says that “when voters make a decision  you suck it up and accept it.”  "The former governor may not know this  but I’m a voter. And my decision is to oppose Donald Trump. So he can suck it up and accept it. This “will of the people” stuff does nothing for me as the will of the people is the very mob rule our founders worked hard to constrain."  Actually  Erick  I am aware that you are a voter.  And so am I.  And I’ve been something you haven’t been—a candidate for President.  Twice.  I didn’t get the nomination either time.  And those darn voters are the reason why.  It never occurred to me that since I really did think they were wrong that I could just get some political people in a secret meeting and maybe get the nomination the “Soviet way.”  We’ll let people think they are voting  but then we’ll pick me after all.    Trump was certainly not my first choice—I was my first choice.  I went from a nice income to zero income  gave a year of my life  asked great sacrifices on the part of donors  staff  and volunteers and gave it all I had and then some.  And the voters chose differently.  I could blame the media for giving me virtually no attention and giving it all to Trump.  I could blame the people who promised their support and urged me to get in the race but who then disappeared into the camps of others because they saw better paychecks  better rewards  or maybe really thought they saw a better candidate.  But in the end  my fate was decided by voters.  The old Democrat political jokester Dick Tuck  who be-deviled Richard Nixon with some of the great political pranks of all time  eventually decided to run himself  for a CA state senate seat in 1966. He finished 3rd in a field of 8 and as the results came in  he uttered one of the most quoted political lines of all time (and forgive the verbatim language):  “The people have spoken….the bastards.”  Dick Tuck said it for humor.  Today  we have GOP establishment types who are saying it because they mean it.    We have elections not because the people get it right all the time.  They don’t.  But they have the right to make a mistake.  I think they made one by not nominated me.  They sure made one electing Barak Obama and would make a bigger one electing Hillary.  But our system was designed to ultimately keep the power away from an oligarchy and let every citizen participate in selecting their leaders.   Don’t like Trump?  Don’t like Cruz?  Don’t like Kasich?  Vote differently.  Or don’t vote.  But sorry  no matter WHO you are  you only get one vote.

Hillary’s speech and the fundraising emails her campaign sent out after Tuesday's results gave us a preview of the kind of conventional scorched-earth campaign she plans to run against him.  I’m familiar with the tactics.  Every race I ever ran in Arkansas was against the Clinton Machine.  But if they expect Trump to stand there and take it  or backpedal and apologize when he’s accused of being a sexist or Nazi or whatever  they’re in for a rude awakening.  He’ll take a page from the Obama playbook  go on offense in unexpected ways  and throw it back in their faces twice as hard.  And with polls showing that many Americans are fed up with political correctness and tired of being called racist if they just want the borders secured and immigration laws enforced  Hillary may discover the old  reliable Democratic dog whistles no longer work.    It’s said that Hillary’s people are dancing with glee at the idea of running against Trump because he’ll be so easy to beat.  Not to compare Trump with Ronald Reagan  but that’s exactly what Jimmy Carter’s people thought about him.  They underestimated both their opponent and the American public’s level of frustration with smug liberal incompetence.  They’d better figure out quickly that the only thing certain about this race is that we should continue to expect the unexpected.

So far  Senate Republican leaders are holding firm  but they’ll be under pressure by Democrats and the media to cave in.  If nothing else comes of this  Obama has squandered his last months in office by choosing to create another divisive  partisan face-off rather than work with Congress to accomplish something realistic.

But even the New York Times said his appointment would result in the most liberal Court in decades.  They cited a university study that places him ideologically alongside Kagan and Sotomayor  and he’s believed to oppose the idea that the 2nd Amendment is an individual right.  Personally  I think that if you don’t believe the entire Bill of Rights is a list of individual rights  then you should probably find a line of work other than judge.

But they probably never imagined how fast things would deteriorate with a leftist at the wheel.    After 9/11  the NYPD were admired as heroes.  Today  with a mayor who is dismantling every program that's reduced crime and who reflexively sides against the police  a survey of NY cops finds that 96% think community relations have worsened and 87% believe the city is less safe since DeBlasio took office (55% say it’s “a lot less safe”).  89% say they’d quit the force if they had a better offer  and about the same number wouldn’t recommend a career in law enforcement to their loved ones.  There are more findings at the link  all equally grim.  Other US cities that have had uninterrupted Democratic rule for decades (Chicago  Baltimore  Detroit  St. Louis  Oakland  etc.) might have grown used to crime and blight.  But New Yorkers don’t have that excuse.  Many survived the Dinkins years  saw Republican Rudy Giuliani perform a miracle turnaround and sort-of Republican Mike Bloomberg maintain it.  Once you’ve showered and put on a nice  clean suit  why would you willingly dive back into a cesspool?

What you seldom hear is that the Democrats are experiencing a crack-up  too.  Many Democrats  especially younger voters  are no happier with the status quo than Republicans are.  It’s just that the media don’t like covering Democratic problems  plus they’ve created a system that makes it a lot harder for an outsider to win.    Democrats vote today in five states.  So far  Hillary Clinton has won 14 primaries and caucuses  Bernie Sanders  9.  In terms of delegates actually won  she’s only ahead by 775 to 464.  But add in all the party insider super delegates who’ve pledged to Hillary without regard for what their voters want  and Hillary’s total leaps to 1239.  That means she’s won just 14 out of 57 contests  yet she’s already more than halfway to the nomination.  The Democratic system is sort of like a mile-long race in which one runner gets to start at the half-mile mark.  And they claim they’re the party of fairness!    On the bright side  when Bernie’s supporters whine that it’s unfair that delegates he worked for got redistributed to somebody who didn’t earn them  it could be a better lesson about socialism than they ever got in college.  Or from Bernie.

It’s a feeling we can all relate to.  That feeling is largely what’s behind the record turnout in the Republican primaries  and today will likely bring more of the same.  It’s starting to feel as if every Tuesday is another Super Tuesday.  I don’t know about you  but I’m ready for a Normal Tuesday.  Today  Republicans vote in North Carolina  Missouri  Illinois  the Northern Mariana Islands  and the two states getting the most attention  Florida and Ohio.    Today is when winner-take-all races start  where any candidate who comes in first  even with just a plurality of votes  can start racking up delegates and pulling ahead fast.  Florida and Ohio are winner-take-all states where native sons Marco Rubio and John Kasich hope to deny Donald Trump big scores of delegates.  Neither has shown much strength beyond their home states  but if they can help keep Trump’s total below 1237 by convention time  it could spark a brokered convention.  Of course  if the GOP denies the candidate with the most votes the nomination and hand-picks someone the voters rejected  then their attempt to save the party just might destroy it.

The reporter asked if he realized that they were attacking free speech.  The young man said  no  what Trump says isn’t free speech.  It’s “hate speech ” and that’s not protected.  Let’s try to untangle that twisted yarn ball of logic.  You might strongly disagree with Trump  but has he really said anything that rises to the level of “hate speech”?  He’s been compared to Hitler.  Has he ever suggested putting any ethnic group into concentration camps or gas chambers?  The left routinely accuses Republicans of being racists and Nazis  without the slightest justification.  Isn’t that “hate speech?”  It’s certainly one of the most hateful false accusations you can make against someone.  Suppose I could get that declared to be “hate speech.”  Could I then order liberals never to call anyone a “Nazi” again unless they were really were Nazis?  After all  “hate speech” isn’t protected  right?  But then  who will decide exactly which speech doesn’t deserve protection?  Apparently  some random guy on a Chicago street corner.

The Islamic pressure group CAIR is already demanding an apology.    I suspect that Trump and most of his supporters know that many Muslims are risking their own lives to fight radical Islam. They’re probably just frustrated with the constant pressure from the media and groups like CAIR not to say anything negative at all  even about Muslims who openly flaunt their hatred of America and their intention to kill us.  But let’s drop the double standard and admit the truth. Condemning all Muslims for the actions of a radical minority is wrong  but so is our current President’s refusal even to acknowlege that ISIS is Islamic  when that’s what the first “I” in their name stands for.

Kearney Consulting that found that 61% of Americans agree that continued immigration jeopardizes the US. That includes both legal and illegal immigration.     The study found that concern about the effects of unfettered immigration is particularly high among those with only a high school or “some college” education.  Again  expect that to be spun as the prejudice of the poorly-educated. But maybe it’s because people without degrees are the most likely to lose their jobs to lower-paid immigrants (well  aside from Disney IT workers).  This survey suggests that it might be a suicidal election strategy for Democrats to tar opponents of more immigration as a racist fringe group. Sixty-one percent of the population is a pretty big fringe.

Yes  but there was actual proof that smoking caused cancer  not just computer models of a diseased lung.  As blogger and law professor Glenn Reynolds observed  liberals who call Donald Trump a fascist now want to prosecute people for questioning the government.    Questioning scientific theories isn’t anti-science  it’s the very definition of science.  Can you imagine not being allowed to question scientific theories that are tainted by politics?  For example  the Daily Caller reports that some researchers at the University of Oregon have determined that the science of studying glaciers is sexist.   As the abstract of their “feminist glaciology” paper puts it  quote: “Merging feminist postcolonial science studies and feminist political ecology  the feminist glaciology framework generates robust analysis of gender  power  and epistemologies in dynamic social-ecological systems  thereby leading to more just and equitable science and human-ice interactions.”  End quote.  It’s important not to be sexist in your human-ice interactions.  You don’t want to get the cold shoulder from an Ice Queen.    Can you imagine being threatened with prosecution if you laughed at that absurd study?  Many real scientists said they were dumbfounded by it.  They thought it had to be a joke  but it isn’t.   Well  maybe this will help you keep a straight face.  That study was paid for with over $709 000 in grants of your tax money from the National Science Foundation.  The authors might be off-base about glaciers  but they must be experts at snowing grant committees.

The latest debate was held in Miami for Univision  so the target audience for that night’s pandering was Hispanics.  Both tried to outdo each other in promising to go even further than Obama in protecting and granting citizenship to – and this is the Washington Post’s term – “immigrants in the United States without proper documentation.”    That’s a perfect example of George Carlin’s observation about politically correct language: that the idea is to keep making terms longer and vaguer until you finally bleed all the meaning out of them.  Liberals disliked “illegal alien.”  It was  to use a term Bernie applied to Donald Trump  “vulgar.”  But it was clear and accurate.  It meant aliens who were in the US illegally.  Then it became “illegal immigrant ” then “undocumented immigrant”  and now “immigrant in the US without proper documentation.”  That could be an Australian who became a Canadian citizen  then vacationed in the US and left his wallet at home.  I can’t help wondering how Bernie or Hillary would react if someone broke into their bedrooms and refused to leave by claiming they weren’t burglars or trespassers  they were “houseguests without proper documentation.”  I have a feeling Bernie or Hillary would call the cops.

While Joe Biden was visiting Israel to urge both sides to make peace (amid a flurry of Palestinian knife attacks on innocent Israelis)  Iran was defying a UN resolution prohibiting Iran from testing ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear warheads. Iran not only tested two ballistic missiles  but multiple news sources report that one had “Israel should be wiped off the Earth” written on it in Hebrew.    You’d think that would be a clear enough message of Iran’s intentions for anyone to grasp.  But when we have a President who was promoting Iran as our new partner in peace at the same time their parliament was chanting  “Death to America ” then  as Strother Martin said in “Cool Hand Luke ” “What we’ve got here is a failure to communicate.”

This wasn’t even on ESPN  but in a radio interview.  I’ve been in TV long enough to know that such decisions are usually made well in advance  but it’s sparked accusations of political retaliation.  ESPN declined to comment  but that will only feed the rumors.    If this isn’t retaliation against Ditka for being a conservative  then ESPN needs to say so loud and clear.  Even media companies that don’t participate in political blacklists are complicit in chilling free speech when they refuse to speak up and denounce the whole idea.

I know  Hillary and Bernie appearing on Fox News seems as unlikely as...well  frankly  there’s nothing on Earth as unlikely as that.  Hillary has dodged Fox News for years – but then  she’s not used to appearing in any forum where she might face tough questions.  She hasn’t even held a press conference with the reporters traveling with her since December 4th of last year.    Pundits noted that Hillary especially seemed a bit antsy and over-caffeinated.  Although I thought the Fox News moderators went easier on her and Sanders than they did on us Republican candidates.  Maybe they were just so stunned that the two actually showed up that they thought they had to tread softly to keep from scaring them away  like birdwatchers tiptoeing past two rare loons.    The biggest news to come out of the Fox town hall was when Bret Baier actually questioned Hillary about the classified information on her email server.  She brushed it off by claiming that nothing was marked classified at the time  and that it’s all so innocuous  it’s absurd that it was marked classified at all.  Yet  out of the emails she deemed “work-related” and didn’t delete  over 2 000 were found to have information at the lowest classified level of “confidential ” 65 were branded “secret” and 22 were classified by the State Department as “top secret.”  As for the excuse that they weren’t labeled “classified” at the time  I guess we need a quick lesson in Remedial Email Security 101.  Not for her  I think she knows this already; but for anyone who might swallow the excuse that they weren’t marked classified.    No  of course they weren’t.  The Secretary of State is often the originator or one of the first people to receive sensitive communications.  They aren’t marked “classified” because nobody whose job is to mark them “classified” has seen them yet.  As a top Cabinet official  she was supposed to know that some documents are “born classified.”  That’s why  to be safe  all of her communications should have been routed through a secure government server  not a private  jerry-rigged server in somebody’s bathroom.

I wrote recently about the blizzard of new banking regulations (over 16 000 pages worth in 2013 alone) that’s forcing hundreds of small town community banks to close  leaving consumers at the mercy of too-big-to-fail mega-banks.  Now  Obama’s Labor Department has proposed a new rule that might block everyday working Americans from being able to access financial advice at all.    Its “good intention” is to protect consumers from shady financial advisers who have “conflicts of interest” because they receive payment from “any third party source.” The practical effect is that it could censor financial radio hosts like Dave Ramsey and Suze Ormond from offering advice  because they’re not paid by the callers.  A study of a similar law in the UK found that people who had less than $250 000 were left high and dry because most professional brokers wouldn't even talk to them.  This rule obviously seems to violate the First Amendment  but think how much damage it could cause before it finally gets thrown out by the Supreme Court – if the current SCOTUS would even throw out a law just because it's unconstitutional.  If you want to prevent the government from “helping” you into the poor house  read about this proposed rule change and let your Congress member know how you feel.     Personally  I’m not surprised that this Administration would want to shut down Dave Ramsey.  He helps people get out of debt by telling them to stop spending money on things they can’t afford.  That goes against everything Obama stands for.

Martin was my friend and mentor as he was to so many who learned their politics the Martin Sabo way: do what is best for your district  stand up for the people you represent  and don't forget to have some fun while you're at it.  At a time when our politics has become increasingly coarse  Martin knew how to be strong but civil  effective but kind. In his quiet Scandinavian way  he was a fierce progressive who got things done for his district and our state. And whether it was playing on the congressional softball team or bringing home the funding for a road or a housing project  Martin Sabo truly enjoyed his work.   In my early days in politics  Congressman Sabo never minded if I tagged along with him to his Minnehaha Park picnics or senior citizen door knocks  and  even though my last name was twice as long as his  he agreed to do joint lawn signs when I first ran for county attorney. He was a veteran congressman and I was a political rookie  but he didn't hesitate to help. He saw it as part of his job to help young people get started in politics. And Martin was so popular that those signs may have well been the reason I won (by less than nine votes per precinct!) that first election.  Martin was an extraordinary and exemplary public servant who also stayed active and involved in his community after leaving office. He rarely missed a major gathering or a political event  especially if it involved his beloved Norway.  My thoughts and prayers are with Sylvia and all of Martin's family.

Today we have released a draft modern Education Act - the result an 18 month review and extensive community consultation around the state.  Our proposed changes include: - lowering the compulsory minimum starting age (for prep) by six months  to four years and six months  - increasing the leaving requirements to completion of Year 12  a Certificate III  or reaching 18-years of age.  As it stands Tasmanian students can leave school with as much as two years less education than students interstate.   And  almost half of our children miss out on high quality learning at a young age because not every family can afford child care or private education.   We want every Tasmanian to have equal access to a quality education for longer.

Jacinta Allan MP made it absolutely clear that there will be no ‘Sky Rail’ on the Frankston Train Line and that the Victorian Government will not be building one.  Eleven level crossings are being removed on the Frankston line. Three are already being removed with rail under road and the remaining eight crossings are spaced out along the rail corridor.   Within these eight level crossings to be removed there are a number of level crossings that will be left in place.   This rules out an extended elevated line  as will be built on the Dandenong train line  and the Victorian Government will not be building one.   This confirmation by the Victorian Government has exposed the Liberal Party’s shameful lies to our community. The Liberals had hoped that they could use the community consultation period of the Level Crossing Removal Authority to spread misinformation and scare local residents by claiming on a recent flyer that the State Government had a plan for a ‘four-storey sky rail near you’. There was never such a plan.  The State Government’s confirmation that there will be no Sky Rail on the Frankston Line  and that there were never any plans for one  has exposed the Liberals’ misinformation campaign for what it is  petty partisan lies by a desperate and deceitful Liberal Party.  The State Government has made it absolutely clear. There will be no Sky Rail on the Frankston Line and there was never any plan for one.

Negative gearing tax concessions cost over $3.6 billion last year   about as much as the government spent on assistance to jobseekers and vocational training  and twice what it spent on assistance to indigenous Australians. These tax concessions are shutting Australians out of the property market  with investors routinely outbidding prospective buyers  driving up the cost of housing.  Only Labor has a plan to end negative gearing tax concessions for investors  with exemptions for new constructions and no change to existing negatively geared properties.

With members like this  it's not a surprise when the Liberal Party cut jobs and funding from the CSIRO - but it's still devastating.  Labor takes science seriously. We listen to scientists  because they know what they're talking about. If you needed legal advice  you wouldn't ask your local bus driver  you'd go to a lawyer or legal aid centre. If you needed scientific advice  you wouldn't go to a fossil fuel lobbyist  you'd see a scientist.

This was the most important decision taken by the UK in many decades. The result was clear but close. The country is now deeply divided  regionally  generationally and attitudinally.  The question is how to unite; how to protect and advance the UK’s national interest; and specifically what is the right future relationship with Europe.  This will not be easy. The elation – at least amongst some of the Brexiteers – is matched by a profound dismay in the ranks of Remain voters; and in the case of younger voters an anger which will not abate quickly. And those of us who are passionate believers in the Union are wracked by the possibility of its break up.   This is why we  the British people  are going to have so much more information in the time ahead. We have a right to carry on being part of the debate  to consider the facts which will now take the place of the claims and counterclaims  and to discuss the options which will be put before us. Actually the people do have a right to change their mind  but that is not for now.  It is just that though we now know the decision of the referendum  so much about our future is unknown and undecided.  Our nation is in peril. To allow us to come safely through this we need to be adult in our politics  to proceed with calm  maturity and without bitterness; because our future as a nation in the world and as the UK itself is at stake.

It ends four decades of membership of the European Union  if it is proceeded with in the way envisaged at the moment.  It is a decision that is very indicative of the politics we’re dealing with today across the world. It was a popular revolt against the establishment  the elites. It focused really around the issue of immigration. It brought together people who were against Europe for different and opposite reasons. Some who were against Europe on the right they believed it was too bureaucratic and too social democratic. And people who were against Europe because they thought it meant the free movement of immigrants around the EU.   It’s a very big decision and we don’t yet know what our new relationship with Europe will be. In the time to come there will be a negotiation  which will work out what the relationship is  because there are many different aspects to this. But the most important for our economy is that we’re part of the single market. If we come out of this it stands to reason that we will pay a significant economic penalty.

You just had a claim and a counter-claim from two people that had said they’d seen it.   But this claim and counter-claim of the referendum campaign is going to fall away  and what you’re going to be faced with is the reality. Britain is going to be a real-time  real-life experiment in populist politics.   The people that wanted us out said  look  it’s going to be fantastic  this things going to work wonderfully and they said  all these people who are telling you it’s not  are saying it’s a disaster  they’re the establishment  they’re the elite  they don’t know what they’re talking about.   But three days into it our stock market has fallen  our pound has dropped to its lowest level since the 1980s. We’ve had our credit rating downgraded. Things are looking a little different and there’s going to be a lot that plays out in the next few months.   For example  what does this new relationship look like? What does it really mean for our business? Do the stock market and financial markets all settle down?   This has got a long way to go and I don’t think we should take any irrevocable decisions.    The referendum has also shown that the elite looks out of touch because it says “look we’ll manage all this for you  we know best  we’ll sort it all out for you.” But people feel their incomes have been flat-lining for a long time. They feel the next generation’s opportunities are not going to be an improvement. They want real change and don’t their case for change has been met.  It means that insurgent  populist movements are there for very real reasons. And social media allows these movements to gain scale at speed. It can help build a sense of belonging among people very quickly  which in itself is a revolutionary phenomena.   You see this round the world. You could go to any European country and have the same discussion.

Insurgent movements of left and right  posing as standard-bearers of a popular revolt against the political establishment  can spread and grow at scale and speed. Today’s polarised and fragmented news coverage only encourages such insurgencies — an effect magnified many times by the social media revolution.  It was already clear before the Brexit vote that modern populist movements could take control of political parties. What wasn’t clear was whether they could take over a country like Britain. Now we know they can.  Those in the political centre were demonised as out-of-touch elites  as though the people leading the insurgency were ordinary folks — which  in the case of the Brexit campaign  is a laughable proposition. Bit it's clear the centre has lost its power to persuade and its essential means of connection to the people it seeks to represent. Instead  we are seeing a convergence of the far left and far right. The right attacks immigrants while the left rails at bankers  but the spirit of insurgency  the venting of anger at those in power and the addiction to simple  demagogic answers to complex problems are the same for both extremes. Underlying it all is a shared hostility to globalisation.  The centre must regain its political traction  rediscover its capacity to analyse the problems we all face and find solutions that rise above the populist anger. If we do not succeed in beating back the far left and far right before they take the nations of Europe on this reckless experiment  it will end the way such rash action always does in history: at best  in disillusion; at worst  in rancorous division. The centre must hold.

Three million jobs in the UK are linked to EU exports; around one in every ten jobs in the country.   A vote to Remain will also be a vote to stand up for the rights of everyone to be treated fairly at work. This is something the Labour Party cares passionately about and why as Prime Minister I signed up to the European Social Chapter – to ensure decent terms and conditions for British workers  including guaranteed paid holidays.   It’s easy to take these rights  which are underpinned by EU law  for granted  but never forget: many of those leading the Leave campaign opposed the Social Chapter; opposed our introduction of the minimum wage; opposed basic trade union rights. They believe being out of Europe gives them a chance to chip away at all of these hard won and necessary protections.   But Thursday’s vote is also fundamentally about the sort of country we want to live in and the sorts of opportunities we can provide for future generations. If we stay  future growth and trade with our European neighbours promises hundreds of thousands of more British jobs in industries of the future. And we need to seize this with both hands if we want to ensure our children are able to thrive in an increasingly globalised world.

Education is one of our most effective instruments in countering it.

That is why I'm pleased to announce Generation Global. It uses what we have learnt from our programme  and builds on this experience to give young people the tools of a truly global citizenship.

That cannot be disputed. Our entire relationship with European Union that’s grown over decades of interlocking trade agreements  service agreements  all of that has then got to be renegotiated or scrapped. And given that half our trade is with the European Union  it is clear in leaving we’re going to suffer several years of economic uncertainty.  This is not scare-mongering; it’s a warning.  If you look at the arguments rationally  they stack out very  very strongly. But we’ve now got to the somewhat absurd situation whereas if someone’s an expert  that’s the worst insult you can level. Occasionally  rational evidence is a good thing to work off.

Then  smart-phones weren’t smart  while the internet of things was more  ‘what is this internet thing?’ But 20 years on  this statement is even more true. The pace of this revolutionary change has accelerated. This is a generation experiencing the next technological advance  with big data and AI  cryptocurrency and blockchain. And rather than being angry at the challenges it brings  we need politics to give answers to them.   In particular  we need to look at how we can apply the latest technology to public services. Take healthcare. In diagnostics  machine learning today means that computers can go through thousands of CT or MRI scans to identify anomalies  which can then be checked by doctors. Rather than automation  this is about symbiosis  with the time saved giving doctors more time to spend treating patients.   This is why we need progressives to be more radical  more open and more able to absorb the latest thinking  and less afraid of innovating. New technology gives us greater individual opportunity  but also the ability for common endeavour and collective entrepreneurship. I have to had to adjust to the changes it has brought: I sent my first text message in 2007. But these are the changes happening around us. It is up to us to shape them as a force for good. And as a force of good for all.

It’s not just ISIS in Syria  you’ve got ISIS in Libya  Boko Haram in Nigeria  Al-Shabaab in Somalia. There are groups in the Philippines and Thailand.    The latest Global Extremism Monitor from my Centre on Religion & Geopolitics shows the extent of the problem. In April 28 extremist groups instigated 207 violent incidents in 23 countries. The five worst incidents alone killed at least 308 people.   It means that this year alone there have already been over 12 000 deaths as a result of this violence  with 53 countries having either suffered violent extremist attacks or expended efforts to defeat the scourge.

It is not an exaggeration to call it the most important decision for Britain since 1945.   Retreating now would be painful; not a little painful  but a long  agonising process of dis-engagement. On its own  leaving the European Single Market – by volume the biggest commercial market in the world –is a seismic economic decision. It would be a betrayal of the British interest by exiting what was a British achievement.   To be worth the risk  leaving would have to entail not a marginal benefit  but an overwhelming raison d’etre. But the ‘Leave’ campaign has been divided for a reason. Those arguing for ‘Leave’  agree about leaving. But actually they deeply disagree about why.   On the one side you have those who oppose Europe because it is part of the onward march of globalisation. They see the changes it brings  the disruption to the way we live and work and they resent it. For them  immigration is the core argument because it symbolises this new world. These are heartfelt anxieties  felt by people round the world. They shouldn't be dismissed or taken lightly.   But on the other side are those whose real case against Europe is precisely the opposite: that it is an organisation which blunts the opportunities of globalisation. They're not really anti-immigrant  they're anti social protection. They're not in favour of trade barriers; they're for dismantling all barriers. Their vision of Britain is for us to become an offshore free market hub whose very virtue is the absence of restrictions  not the imposition of them.  It isn't a sensible strategy. We will pay all the heavy financial costs of exit  but then spend further years in a coruscating debate as to how to find a new future. Get this vote out of the way and then go back to what we do best and have done throughout our time in the EU: giving Europe that hard-headed practical leadership which it needs.

The truth of it is: the case Britain’s making for reform is basically right and it’s got allies on the continent to do this. Europe needs Britain’s leadership. There are a whole series of issues that are tackled in a much better way if Britain is there and active.  When Britain seeks to lead in Europe – and builds the right partnerships and alliances – it usually gets its way. We did this over the single market  over enlargement of Europe  which is still an enormous British achievement. We have done it in successive budget negotiations.  This is the role Britain should play in Europe. And it is why we should remain.

Because the whole point about governance and government is we kind of know what works and what doesn’t. That’s what’s kind of fascinating about it. You go around the world and you can see governance makes a difference. Sometimes it makes the biggest difference.

African countries must be in the driving seat of their own development  setting the priorities and making the decisions. And what the West should be doing is making sure our expertise – technology firms  investors  as well as aid and development – is available  for any developing government that wants it.  First and foremost  this is needed in helping nations develop their basic technological infrastructure. In the West  this is about servers and data; web traffic will drop significantly if a site takes longer than two seconds to load. But for many in Africa  it’s simply about having a power supply. Only one in four Africans currently has access to electricity. And all of the presidents I work with name access to electricity as a top priority.   Second  to encourage innovation  as well as ensure that collective entrepreneurship can happen  we also need to continue to work with African nations to promote good governance  ensuring there is strong rule of law and systems in place so that governments can change power plans to power plants.  Third  at a time when populists from both left and right ride public anger in the West  we should not lose sight of the fact that success in the modern age requires being open to the world; building alliances  integrating ideas and ensuring they are pushed across the boundaries of nation or culture.   Countries such as Rwanda and Kenya are doing this today. But right across Africa  there is a new generation of leadership  pushing the continent forward  confident in its future. This optimism has seen them embrace technology  and use it as a force for good. This is right  because if history has taught us anything  it’s that pessimists tend to be poor guides to the future.

To see why this is happening  you’ve got to go back several decades and you’ve got to see how this has grown. You’ve got to see things like the significance of the Iranian revolution in 1979. The storming of Mecca in 1980. You’ve got to realise how the populations of these countries have grown: 50 years ago  Egypt had 30 million people. It has 100 million people today. The roots of this are a toxic mixture of bad politics  an abuse of religion that has grown over a long period of time and is now a global phenomenon.   We also need to look at education systems around the world. Take for example Northern Nigeria  where Boko Haram do their recruiting. There are millions of young kids educated to a view of the world that is poisonous towards those that are different. Look at Bangladesh. Then you go around the education systems in the Middle East and young people  in young populations  are being taught a view of the world that is contrary to the way the world can exist today and contrary to peaceful coexistence.   So we’re never going to defeat this unless we realise this isn’t a problem we have caused  it’s a problem we got caught up in. The roots are this ideology that is within Islam  but today we have allies within Islam who can help us defeat it  who will stand with us and be our allies in this fight.

The politics of the anger are very easy for populists to ride for both the left and right. And the curious thing is that populism of the left and right at certain points meet. But globalisation is a fact. Technological advance is a fact. These things are going to carry on changing the world. The real question is: what are the solutions and answers that allow us to access the opportunities and minimise the risk.  In the UK  the Leave campaign are massively overstating the costs of being in Europe  and minimising the costs of going. If we left the EU  we have to get back in the single market  and painstakingly renegotiate every single item to get back to where we were. There’s no doubt what the sensible thing to do is  but there are very powerful voices pushing this very hard. It’s not that Europe doesn't require reform  because there’s lots of things that should change in Europe. But the best way to do that is for Britain to be in Europe  leading that case for change  and not out of it and powerless.

It shows how diverse the individual backgrounds are  but also how connected the global jihadi movement is. One of the most significant findings in this research was the prevalence of jihadis who had links to non-violent Islamism  prior to engaging in jihad. This highlights the threat posed by the underlying extreme ideology  aspects of which are shared by both violent and non-violent extremist groups.  That’s not to say that these groups don’t prey on grievances such as poverty  inequality  and deprivation in order to recruit. But in the end  there’s an ideology that’s been taught. And we make a big mistake in policy at the moment when we focus on the tens of thousands that end up as violent jihadists  as in groups like ISIS. We’re not going to defeat the ideology unless we go to the roots of it.  There are millions of young people being educated to a narrow-minded and distorted view of the world from a very early age. They’re being taught that this is the right way to live their lives  according to a perverted interpretation of Islam. And if you don’t live like this  you’re an enemy. If we have millions of people being educated in this way  we shouldn’t be surprised that a proportion of them go into violent extremism.

President Obama expressed his view about the consequences. It’s important we know that view. And what he says is obvious when you think about it. America’s got the TPP and TTIP to negotiate. These are two huge negotiations for them. If Britain opts out of Europe of course it’s going to take time to get to a specifically British deal. And it’s not just President Obama who’s saying it’s sensible for us to stay. I can’t think of a single world leader that’s a strong ally of Britain that’s not saying the same thing.   If Britain withdraws from Europe it’s also going to have to renegotiate its terms of entry into the single market  renegotiate all those regulations  all those laws. And it’s going to be doing it in a circumstance in which the most likely outcome is that we would have to do the same as Norway  the same as Switzerland  who in fact agree all these things about free movement of people – and obedience to European rules – without having any say over them.  On sovereignty  it’s also really quite hard to see what the Leave campaign is saying is the problem. When I was Prime Minister I can’t think of a single big decision I wanted to take that Europe told me I couldn’t. Not one on the NHS  on education  on tax  on welfare  on spending  on war and peace. Not one.  So in the end  when you come down to the practical arguments  they all stack one way. And that’s why I believe the British people will vote to stay.

This has required a strong vision  as well as the collective will to implement it; something all Rwandans should be proud of. Through my foundation  the Tony Blair Africa Governance Initiative  I have been honoured to work alongside them as they have begun to overcome their terrible history. And as we remember all those who lost their lives today  I take confidence in the knowledge that the country and its people have built a new nation  which today has a bright future.  #Kwibuka22

By working closely with those who have influence in their local communities – Imams  Priests and Pastors  women and faith elders – the Faith Acts campaign has mobilised the power and energy of faith communities around a common cause. Last month 50 Sierra Leonean faith leaders were trained  each of whom can then train up to 20 community volunteers at a time. In turn  these people can visit 120 households each. This means that just one faith leader can help to reach up to 2 400 families with life-saving messages.  This programme has shown we can achieve extraordinary results in terms of saving lives: it has already reached over 2.1 million people. And in working together to save lives that would be lost to this easily preventable disease  it also helps to increase respect and understanding across different faiths.

Because this threat is not simply the acts of violence  but the ideology of extremism which gives rise to them. Defeating it will require big all-encompassing decisions for a generation.   It will also require us to escape from the paralysing grip of the present political discourse  in which the right is tipping into bigotry against Muslims as a whole  while the left prefers to believe Western policy caused this  despite the countries now affected covering the entire gamut of policy positions from the most interventionist to the expressly pacific. This discourse disables the alliance we need within Islam.  But the good news is: such an alliance is available today. Many Muslims are speaking out and as they do  others gain confidence and follow; because the majority of Muslims hate the way their faith has been hijacked. And never forget the majority of terrorist victims are Muslim   This new strategy must have two parts: one short-term  the other longer term. Immediately we need to: improve the intelligence cooperation across Europe; recognise that uncontrolled flows of people across Europe constitute an unacceptable security risk; eliminate ISIS with greater speed and vigour; address the conflicts and genuine political grievances which have allowed these groups to flourish; while also realising who are our allies and stand with them.   Longer term  we need: to build military capability able to confront and defeat the terrorists; for countries to accept it is part of their common responsibility to promote religious and cultural tolerance and root out prejudice from their education systems; and boost the capacity of civic society to counter extremism. Aid and development policy must also focus on institution and capacity building  while the role of women and the position of girls should have special recognition  as victims of this ideology  but hugely powerful in the fight against it.  This strategy has to be comprehensive and geared to a struggle similar to that we faced in defeating revolutionary communism or fascism. And the centre has to re-discover its muscularity. We have to provide an answer; otherwise demagogues will ride the anger. We have been there before. It is a part of our history we should not repeat.

Because the truth is: extremism is being incubated in school systems  formal and informal  which are teaching children a narrow minded and often hateful view of those who are different.  This is why we need a muscular centre  which is willing to give real solutions and not ones which are populist but false. If we don’t  and you leave people with a choice between what I would call a bit of flabby liberalism and the hardline  they'll take the hardline.  At the heart of this solution is attacking this extremist thinking  because if you don't attack the ideology you'll never defeat the violence. And we need to do this along with countries in the Middle East. Because in the region there are people who do not regard the notion of peaceful co-existence as a Western value  they see it as a sensible human value  a global value.

Our ideas and work on the ground aim to counter religious conflict and extremism  in order to promote open-minded and stable societies.   Prevention of extremism will only be effective if we build a strategy that deals with the ideas  of which the violence is a tragic symptom. Our work last year helped challenge these ideas and develop resilience within those targeted for radicalisation. We have helped enable educators to pass on vital skills to their students  equipped leaders to resist extremist narratives  and informed policy makers on the religious dimensions of conflict.   The Foundation also launched its Centre on Religion & Geopolitics  a think-tank that aims to help policy makers understand the ideology behind religious extremist violence. Our global schools programme  Face to Faith  has reached over 50 000 students in 20 countries. And through our work supporting leaders  we have formed new strategic partnerships with international organisations including with graduates of one of the world's oldest universities – the Al-Azhar mosque in Cairo – whose Grand Imam is one of the leading authorities within Sunni Islam  and is helping rebut the false theology behind the Jihadist groups.

When you first propose it people tell you it’s a terrible thing. When you’re doing it  it’s hell. And after you've done it  you wish you’d done more of it. This is particularly true of education reform.   But not only does a country’s education system express what its society stands for  it is probably the biggest determinant of whether a nation succeeds or fails. Today  there is real anxiety among people on how the world is changing. As incomes are stagnating and people find it hard to get on  it becomes easy to gravitate to populism. But to push back the wave of populism  one of the answers is to focus on education.  In particular  there needs to be greater focus on the quality of education  so that children are taught the skills that equip them for the modern world. This is why technology is so important  but why you also need a system of evaluation that tells you the truth about where your education stands  investment in good teachers  as well as leadership in schools.   It was great to speak at the Global Education & Skills Forum and meet inspiring educators such as Hanan Al Hroub - حنان الحروب  who teaches in one of The Tony Blair Faith Foundation's Face to Faith schools.

Britain is a strong country  with a strong economy; person for person it’s in the premier league of systems. We can and we should lead in Europe.   We’ve also got to realise how fast the world is changing and how important this relationship is. The pro-European side should get out there with a bit of passion and vigour and determination and stand up for what we believe  not just as a matter of economic realism  but as a matter of political idealism.

Harold was a great Prime Minister  a great leader of the Labour Party; someone of enormous commitment to his country and improving the lives of people. It was a great honour to follow in his footsteps.
