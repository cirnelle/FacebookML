Called the Veil Nebula  the debris is one of the best-known supernova remnants  deriving its name from its delicate  draped filamentary structures. The entire nebula is 110 light-years across  covering six full moons on the sky as seen from Earth  and resides about 2 100 light-years away in the constellation Cygnus  the Swan. This view is a mosaic of six pictures from our Hubble Space Telescope of a small area roughly two light-years across  covering only a tiny fraction of the nebula's vast structure. This close-up look unveils wisps of gas  which are all that remain of what was once a star 20 times more massive than our sun. The fast-moving blast wave from the ancient explosion is plowing into a wall of cool  denser interstellar gas  emitting light. The nebula lies along the edge of a large bubble of low-density gas that was blown into space by the dying star prior to its self-detonation.  Image Credit: NASA/ESA/Hubble Heritage Team

Padalka arrived at the International Space Station on March 27 along with one-year mission crew members NASA astronaut Scott Kelly and Mikhail Kornienko of Roscosmos. Padalka spent 168 days in space during Expeditions 43 and 44  traveling more than 71 million miles during 2 688 orbits of Earth. This completes Padalka’s fifth flight to space for a total of 879 days in space  the most by any human.   It was the first flight to space for both Mogensen and Aimbetov  who made 160 orbits of Earth and traveled more than four million miles during their 10 days in space as visiting crew members. During their short time in orbit  they participated in a number of experiments on behalf of their respective space agencies  focusing on the areas of human research  Earth observation and technology development. They arrived with Russian cosmonaut Sergey Volkov  who will return to Earth with Kelly and Kornienko in March 2016.  Also remaining aboard the orbiting laboratory to continue important research and station maintenance are NASA’s Kjell Lindgren  Oleg Kononenko of Roscosmos and Kimiya Yui of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency.

The Soyuz TMA-18M launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan to the International Space Station at 12:37 a.m. EDT Wednesday (4:37 UTC  10:37 a.m. in Baikonur). At launch  the station was flying 250 miles above south-central Kazakhstan  having passed over the Baikonur Cosmodrome less than a minute before liftoff.   The crew will make 34 orbits of Earth in two days en route to the station before arriving at 3:42 a.m. (7:42 UTC) on Friday  Sept. 4.   With the arrival of Volkov  Mogensen and Aimbetov  nine people will be aboard the orbiting laboratory for the first time since 2013. The three will join Expedition 44 Flight Engineers Scott Kelly and Kjell Lindgren of NASA  Commander Gennady Padalka and Flight Engineers Oleg Kononenko and Mikhail Kornienko of Roscosmos  and Kimiya Yui of the JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency).   The trip enables Roscosmos to rotate a crew member and a Soyuz spacecraft. Volkov will remain aboard the station for the next six months  returning in March 2016 with one-year mission crew members Kelly and Kornienko in the Soyuz TMA-18M. Padalka  who launched in March with Kelly and Kornienko in the Soyuz TMA-16M  will return to Earth in that spacecraft on Sept. 11 with Mogensen and Aimbetov. Each Soyuz remains in orbit for about six months.

Roosevelt designated August 19 as National Aviation Day in honor of Orville Wright’s birthday  directing citizens to celebrate the day with activities that encourage an interest in and appreciation for aviation.   Why is NASA celebrating National Aviation Day? Because we love everything about flight  whether through space or Earth’s atmosphere.   Our experts in all things aviation are dedicated to improving the design of airplanes so they’re more Earth friendly – less fuel use  lower pollution  less noise around airports. And we work with the Federal Aviation Administration to provide air traffic controllers with new tools for improving efficiency and reducing delays – all while maintaining safety in more crowded skies.

Lying around 20 000 light-years from us in the constellation of Scorpius (The Scorpion)  it is one of about 150 globular clusters belonging to our galaxy  the Milky Way.  Typical globular clusters are collections of around a hundred thousand stars  held together by their mutual gravitational attraction in a spherical shape a few hundred light-years across. They contain some of the oldest stars in a galaxy  hence the reddish colors of the stars in this image — the bright blue ones are foreground stars  not part of the cluster. The ages of the stars in the globular cluster tell us that they were formed during the early stages of galaxy formation! Studying them can also help us to understand how galaxies formed.

This is the company’s fourth scheduled cargo delivery mission to the International Space Station under the agency’s Commercial Resupply Services contract.   Cygnus will carry more than 7 000 pounds of science and research  crew supplies and vehicle hardware to the orbital laboratory to support dozens of approximately 250 science and research investigations that will occur during Expeditions 45 and 46. This first Cygnus mission using the Atlas V launch system provides increased performance and flexibility to the Orbital ATK cargo delivery service. The new experiments arriving to the orbital laboratory will challenge and inspire future scientists and explorers. Science payloads will offer a new life science facility that will support studies on cell cultures  bacteria and other microorganisms; a microsatellite deployer and the first microsatellite that will be deployed from the space station; and experiments that will study the behavior of gases and liquids  clarify the thermo-physical properties of molten steel  and evaluate flame-resistant textiles.   Cygnus also will deliver replacement cargo items including a set of Microsoft HoloLens devices for use in NASA’s Sidekick project  a safety jet pack astronauts wear during spacewalks known as SAFER  and high pressure nitrogen and oxygen tanks to plug into the station’s air supply network.   The spacecraft will spend more than a month attached to the space station before its destructive re-entry into Earth’s atmosphere in January 2016  disposing of about 3 000 pounds of trash.

Today  we'll post pics & info about black holes.  What Is a Black Hole?  A black hole is a region in space where the pulling force of gravity is so strong that light is not able to escape. The strong gravity occurs because matter has been pressed into a tiny space. This compression can take place at the end of a star's life. Some black holes are a result of dying stars.  Because no light can escape  black holes are invisible. However  space telescopes with special instruments can help find black holes. They can observe the behavior of material and stars that are very close to black holes.  Pictured here is an artist's drawing a black hole named Cygnus X-1. It formed when a large star caved in. This black hole pulls matter from blue star beside it.  Image Credit: NASA/CXC/M.Weiss #NASA #Space #Blackhole #blackholes

This image is based on a supercomputer climate simulation that shows two different sources of atmospheric carbon dioxide — fires (biomass burning) and massive urban centers known as megacities.  Scientists are using climate models like this one — called GEOS-5 (Goddard Earth Observing Model  Version 5  created at NASA Goddard) — to better understand how carbon dioxide moves around Earth’s atmosphere and how carbon moves through Earth’s air  land and ocean over time. Rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are driving Earth’s ongoing climate change.  This image is from June 2006. The model is based on real emissions inventory data and is then set to run so that scientists can observe how the greenhouse gas behaves in the atmosphere once it has been emitted.

Saffire-I provides a new way to study a realistic fire on a spacecraft. This hasn’t been possible in the past because the risks for performing such studies on crewed spacecraft are too high. Instruments on the returning Cygnus will measure flame growth  oxygen use and more. Results could determine microgravity flammability limits for several spacecraft materials  help to validate NASA’s material selection criteria  and help scientists understand how microgravity and limited oxygen affect flame size. The investigation is crucial for the safety of current and future space missions.

BEAM’s pressure will be equalized with that of the International Space Station  where it will remain attached for a two-year test period.   The module measured just over 7 feet long and just under 7.75 feet in diameter in its packed configuration. BEAM now measures more than 13 feet long and about 10.5 feet in diameter to create 565 cubic feet of habitable volume. It weighs approximately 3 000 pounds.   During the next week  leak checks will be performed on BEAM to ensure its structural integrity. Hatch opening and NASA astronaut Jeff Williams’ first entrance into BEAM will take place about a week after leak checks are complete.   BEAM is an example of NASA’s increased commitment to partnering with industry to enable the growth of the commercial use of space. The project is co-sponsored by NASA's Advanced Exploration Systems Division and Bigelow Aerospace.   Expandable habitats are designed to take up less room on a spacecraft but provide greater volume for living and working in space once expanded. This first test of an expandable module will allow investigators to gauge how well the habitat performs and specifically  how well it protects against solar radiation  space debris and the temperature extremes of space.

This event – which happens about 13 times each century – is called a transit. Our Solar Dynamics Observatory  or SDO  studies the sun 24/7 and captured the entire seven-and-a-half-hour event. This composite image of Mercury’s journey across the sun was created with visible-light images from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on SDO.  Check it out: http://go.nasa.gov/1R2FR2W  Transits provide a great opportunity to study the way planets and stars move in space– information that has been used throughout the ages to better understand the solar system and which still helps scientists today calibrate their instruments.  Although Mercury whips around the sun every 88 days – over four times faster than Earth – the three bodies rarely align. Because Mercury orbits in a plane 7 degrees tilted from Earth’s orbit  it usually darts above or below our line of sight to the sun. As a result  a Mercury transit happens only about 13 times a century. The last one was in 2006  and the next one isn’t until 2019.  Image Credit: NASA/SDO/Genna Duberstein
