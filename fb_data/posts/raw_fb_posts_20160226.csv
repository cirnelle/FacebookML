Kelly wrote  "#goodmorning #aurora and the Pacific Northwest! #YearInSpace" and Peake followed up with  "Getting a photo masterclass from Scott Kelly – magical #aurora"  The dancing lights of the aurora provide spectacular views on the ground  but also capture the imagination of scientists who study incoming energy and particles from the sun. Aurora are one effect of such energetic particles  which can speed out from the sun both in a steady stream called the solar wind and due to giant eruptions known as coronal mass ejections or CMEs.

Older ellipticals are nicknamed "red and dead" by astronomers because these bloated galaxies are not producing new  bluer stars  and are thus packed full of old and redder stellar populations. This type of galaxy has grown more and more common as the universe has evolved  with initially small galaxies merging and progressively building up into larger galactic structures over time.

Lying around 20 000 light-years from us in the constellation of Scorpius (The Scorpion)  it is one of about 150 globular clusters belonging to our galaxy  the Milky Way.  Typical globular clusters are collections of around a hundred thousand stars  held together by their mutual gravitational attraction in a spherical shape a few hundred light-years across. They contain some of the oldest stars in a galaxy  hence the reddish colors of the stars in this image — the bright blue ones are foreground stars  not part of the cluster.

This is the company’s fourth scheduled cargo delivery mission to the International Space Station under the agency’s Commercial Resupply Services contract.   Cygnus will carry more than 7 000 pounds of science and research  crew supplies and vehicle hardware to the orbital laboratory to support dozens of approximately 250 science and research investigations that will occur during Expeditions 45 and 46. This first Cygnus mission using the Atlas V launch system provides increased performance and flexibility to the Orbital ATK cargo delivery service. The new experiments arriving to the orbital laboratory will challenge and inspire future scientists and explorers. Science payloads will offer a new life science facility that will support studies on cell cultures  bacteria and other microorganisms; a microsatellite deployer and the first microsatellite that will be deployed from the space station; and experiments that will study the behavior of gases and liquids  clarify the thermo-physical properties of molten steel  and evaluate flame-resistant textiles.   Cygnus also will deliver replacement cargo items including a set of Microsoft HoloLens devices for use in NASA’s Sidekick project  a safety jet pack astronauts wear during spacewalks known as SAFER  and high pressure nitrogen and oxygen tanks to plug into the station’s air supply network.   The spacecraft will spend more than a month attached to the space station before its destructive re-entry into Earth’s atmosphere in January 2016  disposing of about 3 000 pounds of trash.
