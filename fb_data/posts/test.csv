100 years after Albert Einstein predicted their existence in his Theory of Relativity  gravitational waves  the ripples in space-time caused by massive objects moving through space  have been detected. Gravitational waves will allow us to observe the universe in a new way and tell us more about its beginnings. Incidentally  the National Science Foundation (NSF)’s LIGO lab detected the waves using laser interferometry  the same technology that will be used by NASA’s GRACE-FO mission to continue monitoring Earth’s gravity and mass changes.

NASA scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies have announced that 2015 was the warmest year since modern records began in 1880. In an independent analysis  NOAA scientists also found 2015 was the warmest on record  This video illustrates Earth's long-term warming trend  showing temperature changes from 1950 to 2015 as a rolling five-year average. The darkest oranges represent temperatures 4 degrees Fahrenheit or more warmer than the 1951-80 baseline average.  Not only was 2015 the warmest year -- but it broke the record set in 2014 by a long shot. Fifteen of the 16 warmest years on record have now occurred since 2001.   “Climate change is the challenge of our generation  and NASA’s vital work on this important issue affects every person on Earth ” said NASA Administrator Charles Bolden. “Today’s announcement not only underscores how critical NASA’s Earth observation program is  it is a key data point that should make policy makers stand up and take notice - now is the time to act on climate.”  http://go.nasa.gov/1OG1KVO, HER
Two years ago  a new island  or “nijima ” rose above the water line in the western Pacific  about 1 000 kilometers (600 miles) south of Tokyo.

Over the past two years  that new island swallowed up its neighbor  and the merged island is now twelve times the size of the old island.

Planet Water  "Planet Water" is all NASA astronaut Scott Kelly tweeted when he shared the top image on October 4  2015. "Earth seems glassy in some lighting like a blue marble " he said of the second image.   Water planet is right. Viewed from space  the most striking feature of our planet is the water. In both liquid and frozen form  it covers 75% of the Earth’s surface. It fills the sky with clouds. Water is practically everywhere on Earth  from inside the rocky crust to inside our cells.  In all  the Earth’s water content is about 1.39 billion cubic kilometers (331 million cubic miles)  with the bulk of it  about 96.5%  being in the global oceans. As for the rest  approximately 1.7% is stored in the polar icecaps  glaciers  and permanent snow  and another 1.7% is stored in groundwater  lakes  rivers  streams  and soil.  Only a thousandth of 1% of the water on Earth exists as water vapor in the atmosphere. Despite its small amount  this water vapor has a huge influence on the planet. Water vapor is a powerful greenhouse gas  and it is a major driver of the Earth’s weather and climate as it travels around the globe  transporting heat with it.  For human needs  the amount of freshwater for drinking and agriculture is particularly important. Freshwater exists in lakes  rivers  groundwater  and frozen as snow and ice. Estimates of groundwater are particularly difficult to make  and they vary widely. Groundwater may constitute anywhere from approximately 22 to 30% of fresh water  with ice accounting for most of the remaining 78 to 70%.”  See Kelly's tweets at  http://go.nasa.gov/1OjWc7O http://go.nasa.gov/1OjWaww  Read more about our watery planet at http://go.nasa.gov/1OjWcoa  Read more about the water cycle at  http://go.nasa.gov/1OjWcoc  #EarthRightNow, HER

"Potato Earth" Gravity Map  We asked yesterday if the pull of gravity is the same everywhere on Earth. As many of you noted  the answer is no. This map of Earth's gravity field  based on airborne and satellite measurements  depicts variations in Earth's gravity field. As Astronomy Picture of the Day explained when they ran a similar image in 2014: "High areas on this map  colored red  indicate areas where gravity is slightly stronger than usual  while in blue areas gravity is slightly weaker. Many bumps and valleys can be attributed to surface features  such as the North Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the Himalayan Mountains  but others cannot  and so might relate to unusually high or low sub-surface densities." In addition  processes happening deep in the Earth's mantle—such as descending tectonic plates and hot mantle plumes—can also affect the strength of the gravitational field.
