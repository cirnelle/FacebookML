New study shows that low-frequency gravitational waves could soon be detectable by existing radio telescopes. Details: http://go.nasa.gov/24pFKZH

You might be surprised to know that data from our Earth-observing satellites and ground-based instruments provide the hidden framework relied upon by GPS. Details: http://go.nasa.gov/1mXWGoq
SpaceX, 2016-02-25T00:26:29+0000, 1197967, 353851465130_10157094429895131, 510, 68, 20, photo, The Falcon 9 remains healthy in advance of SpaceX and SESâ€™s mission to deliver the SES-9 satellite to Geostationary Transfer Orbit. Out of an abundance of caution  the team opted to hold launch for today to ensure liquid oxygen temperatures are as cold as possible in an effort to maximize performance of the vehicle.    SpaceX is now targeting tomorrow  Thursday Feb. 25  at 6:46pm ET for launch of SES-9.
