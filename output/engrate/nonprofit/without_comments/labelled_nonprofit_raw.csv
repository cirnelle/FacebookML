BREAKING: A BABY ELEPHANT HAS JUST DIED AT RINGLING'S TRAINING FACILITY.    Mike was only 2 years old. This young elephant's sad death is no surprise given that four other baby elephants have died under Ringling's watch  including one 8-month-old whose hind legs were shattered during circus training & a 3-year-old who drowned in a pond while trying to get away from a trainer with a bullhook—a weapon that resembles a fireplace poker with a sharp steel hook on one end.   Ringling still uses these weapons at its Florida compound  where elephants are separated from their mothers shortly after birth & beaten into submission & elephants are chained on concrete for many hours each day.   These stressful conditions have been linked to the highly fatal disease that killed this calf  which disproportionately impacts captive baby elephants  yet Ringling continues to breed more babies for a life in chains. These deaths are precisely why PETA is calling for an end to Ringling's breeding program & for all of these elephants to be retired to a proper accredited sanctuary.,HER,photo

BREAKING: RINGLING TO TAKE ELEPHANTS OFF THE ROAD 18 MONTHS EARLY.   Because of failing financial returns from a public that lost a taste for abusive elephant acts long ago & legislatures that are banning them on the grounds of cruelty  it’s no surprise that Ringling Bros. will pull elephants off the road in May  18 months earlier than announced.   Years of living in shackles  held immobile on concrete floors  has left many elephants lame & sick. As a study released just days ago by the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention confirms  elephants can transmit tuberculosis to humans  & Ringling has had TB-positive elephants going from town to town.   Since Ringling is also known to breed elephants & use them as test subjects at the Florida facility where it keeps elephants in shackles  PETA warns that because the circus has refused to retire these elephants to an accredited sanctuary  vigilance will be needed to determine how they are treated. PETA is also calling on the circus to end all animal acts  particularly in light of video footage released last month showing how tigers are trained to perform: http://peta.vg/1osm,HER,photo

BREAKING: An orca has just died at SeaWorld San Antonio.   Unna is the 38th orca used by SeaWorld to die far short of how long she was expected to live  though it is in fact hard to call it 'living' when her 'life' consisted of being taken away from her mother just before her sixth birthday  being impregnated when she was only 8 years old & giving birth to a stillborn orca  & being so deprived of enrichment & the ability to engage in natural behavior that she obsessively picked at the paint on the bottom of SeaWorld's show pool floor until her face became badly injured  says PETA Foundation Wildlife Veterinarian Dr. Heather Rally.   While the infection that killed this orca is common in captivity  there is no evidence to suggest that the same is true of orcas in nature. PETA is calling on SeaWorld to stop sentencing orcas to miserable lives of deprivation in dismal tanks & start building coastal sanctuaries. Thirty-eight dead orcas is 38 too many.  R.I.P.

Swaziland is one of the five countries with the highest HIV rates in the world. The current national adult prevalence rate of HIV infection is 33%  and the HIV prevalence rate among pregnant women rose from 4% in 1992  to 43% in 2004.  Despite these extreme circumstances  Swaziland’s Global Fund-financed HIV/AIDS program has achieved impressive results since its inception in August 2003.  In Swaziland  (RED) money is supporting Global Fund-financed programs  which have already:      * reached over 4 400 mothers with services to prevent mother-to-child-transmission of HIV     * trained over 150 midwives and doctors in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV     * equipped over 40 hospitals to provide services to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV     * reached over 140 000 people with voluntary counseling and testing for prevention of HIV     * trained over 70 counselors to teach prevention of HIV     * set up over 35 counseling and testing centers for prevention of HIV     * established feeding schemes in 335 schools     * built 154 community feeding centers     * provided education support for over 36 000 vulnerable children     * provided anti-retroviral therapy for HIV/AIDS to almost 15 000 patients     * trained over 3 000 health workers to deliver home-based care for patients with HIV/AIDS  In the next two to three years  these programs aim to increase four-fold the number of women receiving treatment to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV  to offer comprehensive support for orphans and to more than double the number of people currently on antiretroviral therapy.  See how (RED) money is helping The Global Fund fight the pandemic.,LER,video

Please join WWP in honoring former Staff Sgt. Ryan Pitts  the ninth recipient of the Medal of Honor  recognized for his combat actions during his service in Afghanistan.   The ceremony was held earlier today. Watch it here: http://bit.ly/1p8EbdH  On the morning of July 13  2008 at about 4 a.m.  Pitts was manning Observation Post Topside  which was positioned east of the main base  and east of a bazaar and hotel complex in Wanat  in the Waygal Valley.  Shortly after  soldiers conducting surveillance identified potential insurgents. They put together a request for fire. But before that could happen  at about 4:20 a.m  Soldiers heard machine-gun fire from the north. After that  the valley erupted in enemy fire.  Soldiers at OP Topside were hit with small arms fire  rocket-propelled grenades and hand grenades. Pitts and six other paratroopers at OP Topside were injured in the initial volley of enemy fire. Two paratroopers were killed. Pitts took grenade shrapnel in both legs and his left arm.  For more than an hour after  Pitts continued to fight and defend his position and his teammates  despite his injuries.  Throughout the battle  despite the loss of blood and severity of his wounds  Pitts' incredible toughness  determination  and ability to communicate with leadership while under fire allowed U.S. forces to hold the observation post and turn the tide of the battle.  Without his ability to stay alert and fight while critically wounded  the enemy would have gained a foothold on high ground and inflicted significantly greater causalities onto the vehicle patrol base  and the enemy could have been in possession of the fallen Soldiers at the observation post.  Nine Soldiers -- Spc. Sergio Abad  Cpl. Jonathan Ayers  Cpl. Jason Bogar  1st Lt. Jonathan Brostrom  Sgt. Israel Garcia  Cpl. Jason Hovater  Cpl. Matthew Phillips  Cpl. Pruitt Rainey  and Cpl. Gunnar Zwilling -- were killed in the battle.,HER,photo

The WWP family is saddened by the tragedy at Fort Hood. In the days and weeks to come  we anticipate much of the media dialogue will center around the shooter's military service and mental health. Please remember this was the act of a single individual. We do all service members  warriors and individuals with mental health needs a disservice when we paint them with a broad brush based upon the actions of one or a few.    Nearly all of America’s sons and daughters who have served in uniform have done so honorably and with distinction. They are law-abiding citizens who contribute greatly to their communities.  It is unfair and unjust to conclude that any service member or veteran dealing with military related stress is considered a risk for violence. Those living with invisible injuries often suffer in silence because of these negative portrayals.     If you are a warrior of this generation coping with the invisible wounds of war  WWP has resources for you  all of which are free of charge.  Please don't be discouraged by what you may hear in the news - seek help. These psychological wounds are real and normal. WWP is here to support and advocate for you during your successful recovery and beyond. We're with you all the way!   We are calling on those covering these events to do their homework and understand the impact of their words.  We all have a responsibility to fairly and accurately discuss these complex issues.,HER,status

He has given to WWP every year since through his birthday  participated with Soldier Ride NY  and even organized a run at his sleep away summer camp. He wrote the answer in the photo on his school test. Amazing!,HER,photo

Wounded Warrior Project (WWP) is outraged that the continued gridlock and government shutdown is now threatening the disbursement of benefits payments to the brave men and women who served and sacrificed for this nation. WWP is committing $20 million to support registered Wounded Warrior Alumni should government checks not go out on or around November 1  2013. If you are a registered Alumnus as of October 14  2013  WWP is prepared to send you a $500 check if the government does not come to a resolution in time for the November payment. These funds are to assist with expenses during this payment gap  and WWP will not ask for reimbursement. While this action would not solve all financial hardship  we are committed to helping our warriors  especially in time of crisis.,HER,status
Retired Army Staff Sergeant Chris Gordon was inspired to join the military  at least in part  by the movie Courage Under Fire.

Wounded Warrior Project is outraged that the continued gridlock and government shutdown is now threatening the disbursement of benefits payments to the brave men and women who served and sacrificed for this nation.  These wounded veterans bear both the visible and invisible wounds of wars from burns and amputations  traumatic brain injuries and paralysis to combat stress  post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. These warriors have already sacrificed so much  it is unfathomable and unacceptable to ask them to bear any further burdens.  It is the fundamental responsibility of the government to pay these service members their benefits and any disruption to those payments is shameful.  These payments were earned in service to our nation. They’ve earned it; they’re owed it.,HER,status

Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with all those affected by the shooting at the Washington Navy Yard. We're incredibly frustrated  though  that much of the dialog in the media has centered around the shooter's military service and mental health conditions. Please remember that this was the act of a single individual  and not representative of all veterans or individuals with mental health needs. Neither military service nor mental health conditions predict these types of violent actions.    If you're struggling with mental health needs  please don't be discouraged by what you may hear in the news- seek help. You're not broken. You're not a ticking time bomb. There are many resources available to help you in your successful recovery and beyond. We're with you all the way!,HER,status

Wounded Warrior Project is shocked and saddened to learn of the sudden passing of James Gandolfini.  While many people knew James for his lead role as Tony Soprano on the iconic HBO television series  The Sopranos  we at WWP knew him as a man passionate about serving and honoring wounded veterans.  James lent his time and talent to efforts including the documentary films  Alive Day Memories and Wartorn and most recently supported Wounded Warrior Project through a campaign highlighting the struggles and sacrifices of this generation of injured service members.  These public efforts were only part of his commitment; he gave so much more behind the scenes and for that we are forever grateful.  Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and those that knew and loved him.,HER,photo

The Wounded Warrior Project family is deeply saddened by the sudden passing of J. T. Townsend.  J.T. lit up a room with his positive energy and outlook on life. Through the J.T. Townsend Foundation he inspired and touched the lives of thousands.  J.T. saw his own spinal cord injury and paralysis as an opportunity to help others  and never wavered in his determination to improve the lives of individuals living with disabilities. J.T was selfless  always giving and using his personal story for good in the community.   We are grateful for the time we had with J.T. as he completed his studies at University of North Florida with an internship in our Jacksonville  FL office.    J.T’s smile and laugh inspired us and we know his beautiful spirit will continue to make a difference in the lives of many more.   Our thoughts and prayers go out to J.T.’s family and friends.

Stop the madness   I’m tired of it. I’m so tired of receiving phone calls and emails from family members devastated by the suicide of their loved one. Sons. Daughters. Husbands. I’m tired of it because I was almost one of those suicides. As a wounded warrior myself and someone who used to believe everyone’s life would be better without me in it  I take this issue personally.   The most recent report from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) reveals that veterans are taking their own lives at a rate of 22 each day  or one suicide every 65 minutes – a 20-percent increase from 2007. Even more gruesome  last year we saw more suicides than combat deaths (349 to 295  according to the latest Pentagon figures).   The suicide epidemic among active duty service members and veterans  does not stem from one area alone and there is not one simple fix   pill  or type of treatment to address all the complex issues the incredible men and women that either wear or have worn the uniform now face.    Part of the blame  lies  squarely with the media and its portrayal of PTSD. It seems the only time this issue is given credence  is when the story is sensational enough to garner ratings. Yet  close to a half million returning service members struggle every day with the symptoms of combat stress  survivors guilt  or PTSD. We are not “damaged goods.” We are Wounded Warriors; human beings experiencing a natural reaction to unnatural situations. Like everyone else we have our ups and downs and strive to live our best life.    Every day we see young men and women with families completing multiple combat tours with very little down time in between deployments. When they do return home  they are faced with the growing fear  often times driven by media  of how those facing the challenge of PTSD can be detrimental to the workplace and their communities. They struggle not to let their families  friends and battle buddies down when in reality those people are their greatest supporters. Most of us mistakenly believe that confusion  depression and guilt are weaknesses and personal failings.   With 34 000 more men and women getting ready to end their campaign in Afghanistan  the work on the home front to help these warriors in the reintegration process will only become tougher. Yet  we know the current landscape: a complete lack of sufficient mental health care providers in the VA  geographical challenges for warriors not near a VA facility  and an overall system ill-prepared for the number of veterans seeking effective treatment.   As executive vice president for Warrior Relations at Wounded Warrior Project® (WWP)  it is my hope to raise awareness to the multitude of issues these incredible individuals face  in hope that real impact can take place. WWP recently presented its legislative priorities on Capitol Hill  pressing for a collaborative effort by the VA  Department of Defense (DOD)  the House and Senate Committees  as well as the Executive Branch Departments to ensure Wounded Warriors successfully transition to civilian life. We urge the closing of gaps to improved mental healthcare of Warriors and their families while helping to ensure access to optimal  long-term rehabilitative care for severely Wounded Warriors  and needed support for their caregivers. The VA cannot do this alone and must start to use the available community resources to implement meaningful and effective change.   We are not simply offering solutions – we are also taking action. Over the next six months  WWP will launch five pilot programs including peer-facilitated support groups  a unique telephone helpline providing non-clinical  emotional support for Wounded Warriors and an insurance program that will provide private mental health services.    We know PTSD and other war-related mental health conditions can be successfully treated. It is my hope that we as a nation start to take this seriously. That we stop repeating the mistakes from the past. I do not lay blame on the DOD or the VA  but on all of society. This starts with the leaders of this country and then continues to every single American to become educated about the issues and to not just stand by and wait for another warrior to commit suicide. If you can help a Warrior or their family  please take the first step. If you cannot personally help  support those who are and urge our leaders at the local  regional and National level to put aside parochial interests and take the lead. Help us prevent them from falling through the cracks and being forgotten. This is a problem for all of us and together we can help those who served our Nation.  -John Roberts Executive Vice President  Warrior Relations Wounded Warrior Project,HER,status
Wounded Warrior Project pauses today to remember and honor an American hero  former Navy Seal Chris Kyle. Chris served this country during four tours in Iraq and received two Silver Stars  among other awards. Upon his retirement from the military he continued to give back to his brothers and sisters in arms by creating the Fitco Cares Foundation. He also represented WWP when he partnered with actor Dean Cain in the television reality show Stars Earns Stripes. Chris was the true embodiment of our logo – one soldier carrying another. He gave of himself on the battlefield and off.  Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and the family of Chad Littlefield  whose life was also taken too soon. Rest in peace.,HER,status

"So many families can't get through this process of recovery and end up breaking up  but this kind of special touch helps us to remember what's really important."  "You guys made us feel like a whole family....sometimes it feels like spouses and families are forgotten and you guys helped us be together again!"  "My girls and wife are everything to me.

“Spike your best friend’s eggnog when they’re not looking.”  Bloomingdale's ran this inappropriate ad that suggests date rape in their holiday catalog  clearly showing the man looking at the woman as she's turned away distracted.

Reworking an ad to point out its sexist nature can help counteract the messages advertisers are trying to convey.

This little girl is smarter than a lot of adults. Meet Maggie  she's seven and saw this sign in her local store.  It upset her right away  she's a big superhero fan. Her mom says in an interview to Buzzfeed that Maggie saw the sign before she did and said something like: “Well that’s wrong! Anybody can like superheroes  they’re being stupid aren’t they?”  The store has since apologized saying: “This alarm clock would make a great gift for both girls and boys. The sign has been removed and we’re sorry if it caused any confusion.”  Best line from the BuzzFeed article is this one: "Fortunately it doesn’t seem to have put her off - as well as superheroes she loves Doctor Who  Minecraft  dragons  skeletons and zombies (she had a cemetery cake for her birthday!) but also likes Frozen  princesses  kittens etc. She just thinks shops labelliing toys for boys or girls is silly: “I can like what I want.”  You're awesome Maggie!,HER,photo

Sexism affects everyone  not just girls and women.  A group of 9 year old boys were asked to put together a list of things they didn't like about being a boy  this is what they created.  You should be able to express yourself without constraint regardless of your gender identity. When you think a behavior is "girly" and therefore inferior you're not only being terrible to women everywhere  but terrible to men who might relate to it too.  So let's stop perpetuating these weird "traditional" male and female roles.,HER,photo

Amazing story from reddit. A single dad who is raising a 13 year old son learned that his son was gay after borrowing his iPad and seeing his Google searches. He went to a section of reddit for LGBT people and asked how he should make his son feel comfortable enough to come out in his own terms. He posted this update a few days later:  "Firstly  I'd just like to thank all of you who commented and gave me advice on the previous post  and because the post got so much attention I thought it wouldn't be fair for me not to make an update.  As many comments suggested that I do  is to slightly hint toward the notion that I am perfectly happy with having a gay son  while letting him do the work in actually saying the words "I'm gay"  and I thought that was a very good idea.  I started off with talking about general media with him  for instance I mentioned how awesome it was that Tim Cook (CEO of Apple) came out as being gay and I asked him what he thought about it and I was completely expecting him to give a typical teenager response like "yeah.. its good" or something like that but he actually gave me a detailed response which I absolutely loved because for the first time in a good while I've actually held a conversation with my son that felt really... rewarding.  I also wanted to talk to him about how I've noticed that he's not been acting as cheerful as he usually has and I sort of gave the cliche spiel of "I love you no matter what and I just want to see you be happy" but I didn't get much of a response that time apart from "yeah I know.."  The next day as I picked him up from school I thought I'd ask him about any crushes he has  and I wanted to make sure I didn't say a gender when I asked him  so instead of 'he' or 'she' I used 'they' etc.. Here is that conversation as I remember it...  Me: So  do you have a crush on anyone? Son: Uhm... no..m..maybe.. Me: Ohhh so who is the lucky person? At this point he sort of looked at me slightly confused  I'm not 100% sure why  but I'm assuming it is because I said "lucky person" rather than "lucky girl". Son: Just someone from my french class... Me: Oh yeah... so what do you like about them? Son: Just.. stuff.. Me: Okay.. but.. like what? Son: I donno they're just kinda funny I guess...  At this point I dropped the conversation but just before I did I told him "Well  whoever it is  they should be so lucky to have you as a boyfriend.." and while I didn't see it  I certainly felt as though he was rolling his eyes at my cheesy comments.  At the dinner table the same day  while we were eating we had a couple minutes of silence  not much was heard apart from the cutlery and my son finally said "I actually wanted to tell you something in the car  but I was afraid you'd get in an accident.."  I looked up from my plate and looked at him straight in the eyes... I could see he was thinking about something and all I could think of was "OMG this is it..." he said "Dad.." with a couple seconds of silence "..I'm gay". I looked at him and couldn't help myself from smiling  and I told him "____  you know I love you so much... right?" and I got up and gave him a huge hug. He even started to cry on my shoulder and because of that I couldn't help myself but shed a couple tears. We talked for a bit while finishing our dinner about how I can't emphasize enough that I love him regardless of which gender he loves etc...  After dinner and after he finished his homework we both lay in our pajamas on the sofa  while I was watching the Cooking Channel and he was playing on his iPad. I had my arm around him and he was leaning his head on my chest  and all I could think of was that I'm the happiest father on earth right now."  This is how it should be for all kids. Kudos to this amazing dad.,HER,photo
We're not making this up  a 90-year-old man named Arnold Abbott was arrested in Fort Lauderdale for feeding the homeless. They just passed a law making it illegal to feed the homeless in public based on the false assumption that if you feed the homeless they will stay homeless (so stupid).  He's facing up to 60 days in jail and a $500 fine.  Arnold has been working with his church's charity for TWO DECADES to feed the homeless.   "These are the poorest of the poor  they have nothing  they don't have a roof over their heads " Abbott  who plans on suing the city  told Local 10 News. "How do you turn them away?"  21 cities now ban feeding the homeless.  Want to do something about it?

Watch: LIFE IS SACRED at the Human Rights Watch Film Festival!   Do you know the story of Antanas Mockus? See the inspiring doc about his life  June 18th & 20th IFC Center & Film Society of Lincoln Center http://bit.ly/1JwQ60d  Violence is part of everyday life in #Colombia  where the military  guerrillas  paramilitaries  and drug cartels have been fighting for decades  and hundreds of thousands of people have been killed. But the unorthodox presidential candidate Antanas Mockus and his enthusiastic young activist supporters attempt to reverse the vicious cycle with an imaginative and positive election campaign. As mayor of Bogotá  dressed in a Superman costume and with an indomitable trust in the good of his fellow citizens  he took on towering crime rates and people's bad traffic habits. Can good ideas and an idealistic drive alone change a political culture where violence is rampant? This is the portrait of an inspiring man and a powerful youth movement  whose stories are relevant far beyond Colombia's borders.,LER,video

Tune in! The creators of THE TRIALS OF SPRING  an incredible project which will be shown as both a feature documentary and a multimedia presentation this week at HRWFF - New York  will be interviewed live on HuffPost Live today at 3:30PM EST!  Director. Gini Reticker and exec. producer Abigail Disney will be interviewed by Alyona Minkovski: http://live.huffingtonpost.com/  Women were on the front lines of the uprisings that swept the Arab world in 2011. Young and old  rich and poor  veiled and unveiled  they took to the streets beside men  their signs held high or hands cupped around their mouths to amplify their voices. But as the jubilation of revolution gave way to the convoluted process of governing—and often the chaos and blood of war—women disappeared from the mainstream story. Behind the scenes  however  they continue to play vital roles—keeping schools open and mouths fed  tending to the sick and injured  keeping the world informed through blogs and social media  lobbying for human rights  running for office  building alliances  even drafting constitutions for fledgling democracies. The Trials of Spring is a multimedia initiative that aims to elevate the stories of these women.,LER,photo

În cazul în care nu va exista o anchetă penală  pot fi cel puţin adoptate politici care să facă reapariţia torturii mai puţin probabilă. CIA  cu tradiţia sa de secretomanie şi lipsa asumării publice  ar trebui să nu mai reţină suspecţi  lăsând astfel de treburi în seama Departamentului de Justiţie. Când suspecţii sunt reţinuţi pentru interogare  Comitetul Internaţional al Crucii Roşii ar trebui să aibă acces imediat şi regulat  fără nicio excepţie. Cu tradiţia sa de confidenţialitate  acesta nu ar pune în pericol investigaţii delicate  în timp ce prezenţa sa ar descuraja orice tentativă de tortură. Iar când tortura reapare  ar trebui să se asigure protecţia pentru cei care o raportează  iar victimele ar trebui să fie lăsate să dea în judecată pentru despăgubiri la Curtea din SUA.,LER,link

Big news! China has announced that it will phase out its domestic ivory market. Here’s what WWF’s Ginette Hemley had to say:   “China should make good on its intentions to close its domestic ivory market by setting in place a firm plan and timeline  one that does not spur an even greater rush to launder ivory through the legal system before it closes. At the same time  the US continues to drag its feet on enacting long-overdue regulations to better control its own sizeable ivory market.   “China  the US  and other major ivory consuming countries hold the key to saving Africa’s elephants. We therefore urge the strongest possible measures from these governments to prevent an unthinkable ending for one of the planet’s most iconic species.”,HER,photo
Tiger news: The population of the Amur tiger in Russia has increased to as many as 540 over the last decade  according to new figures from the interim census results released by the Russian government. There are now between 480 and 540 Amur tigers across their existing range  with around 100 of these known to be cubs. Russia’s Far East is home to 95 percent of the global population of Amur tigers  and the last census in 2005 showed there were between 423 to 502 individuals.  Recent anti-poaching efforts have been integral to the rise in tiger numbers  with tougher punishments and the introduction of criminal charges for the illegal hunting  storage and trafficking of endangered animals and their parts.  "The key is strong political support ” said Mike Baltzer  Leader  WWF Tigers Alive Initiative. “Where we have it  in countries like Russia and India  we are seeing tremendous results. However  in South East Asia  where political support is weaker  we are facing a crisis. These countries stand to lose their tigers if urgent action isn't taken immediately."  WWF is urging every tiger country to conduct a census  as this is a critical component of efforts to double global tiger numbers by 2022  a goal known as Tx2.,HER,photo

Freshwater ecosystems  home to 10% of all known animal species  provide services vital to the health and stability of human communities  including fisheries  water for agricultural and domestic use  hydrological flow regulation  navigation and trade  pollution control and detoxification services. But numerous pressures  including land use change  water use  infrastructure development  pollution and global climate change  working individually and collectively  are impinging on the health of rivers and lakes around the world.  The Living Planet Report 2012 states that the rapid development of water management infrastructure – such as dams  dykes  levees and diversion channels – have left very few rivers entirely free flowing. Of the approximately 177 rivers greater than 1 000km in length  only a third remains free flowing.   Learn more : http://www.facebook.com/worldwildlifefund/app_417953298235415,LER,photo

We want to save Bela’s life and bring him to our sanctuary  but the decision to send him to us or have him put down and cremated is out of our hands. The decision needs to be made by the person designated in Ms. Ley’s will  and we are hopeful that she will agree. Please be patient as we educate her about Best Friends’ life-saving mission and demonstrate that Bela will be in good hands.     Please show your support for Bela to come to Best Friends by adding your positive message of hope for Bela to have a safe and happy holiday by using the hashtag #SaveBela.

BREAKING NEWS: The cages of Barkworks pet store in Los Angeles’ Westside Pavillion mall are looking a little empty. That’s because the store--part of a southern California chain--is closing for good on Monday!  We believe this is due to pressure from the recently-passed L.A. City ordinance banning the sale of mill-bred pets. Additionally  our amazing volunteers have invested hundreds of hours over four years peacefully educating the public every weekend at this and other Barkworks locations about the fact that Barkworks is supplied by cruel puppy mills.  It's an incredibly gratifying way to the end the year with a huge win for animal welfare. And if this can happen at one of America's most popular malls  it can happen anywhere! -jessie  Update per your questions: For more information on puppy mills and what you can do to stop them  check out this link on our website: http://bit.ly/TnUDZc. You might also be interested in this story from KTLA a couple of years ago on puppy mills and stores like Barkworks:http://youtu.be/lEII7ZitTYE.  This store made a business decision to close. It is likely the animals that were not sold were transferred to other Barkworks locations. We would love to see companies like this venture into a retail adoption model.,HER,photo

On Sunday  the Best Friends Rapid Response team  on the water in Oakville  Iowa  rescued a cat from a precarious spot.  The adult children of the cat’s person  worried about George  had contacted the Best Friends team asking for help. So the team motored in their boat to the home  which had about a foot of water inside. The Best Friends crew sloshed around  searching through each room and each closet. But … no George.  Then they reached the kitchen  where there are lots of places to hide. Ethan Gurney began opening cupboards and  sure enough  there was George  hiding in one. “He’s looking a little grumpy  but not too bad ” Ethan said as he lifted George out of the cupboard. (George was later reunited with his grateful person.),LER,video

After spending 10 long hours on the Iowa River on Thursday  the Best Friends Rapid Response team was called to the scene of a cat stuck in a tree surrounded by high waters.  So that night  Rapid Response manager Rich Crook and first responder Ethan Gurney got back in their flat-bottomed boat and motored back out to Oakville – for one last run of the day.  As they moved upstream and neared a long row of trees  Ethan began to whistle. That’s when the cat started meowing. “Sure enough ” Rich says  “there was the cat  in a tree.”,LER,video

Last year  NFL star Michael Vick made national headlines for his involvement in a large  very well organized dog fighting ring. As the legal process unfolded  Best Friends Animal Society made the case that the dogs were the victims  and they did not deserve to die like so many others have. The dogs arrived here at the Sanctuary in early 2008  and it has been clear from the start that these dogs did deserve a second chance. It is hoped that their story can help change perceptions of the dogs that come from fighting backgrounds.,LER,video

I don’t have access to a cessation program. How I can get help to quit?  As of 2009  all 50 states and the District of Columbia run some type of free telephone-based program that links callers with trained counselors. These specialists help plan a quit method that fits each person's unique smoking pattern. People who use telephone counseling are twice as likely to stop smoking as those who don't get this type of help. Help from a counselor can keep quitters from making many common mistakes.

After more than four decades of stigma—at one point  her community absurdly accused her of being a witch—she begins a new journey. Tonight she is safely home with her husband and her two daughters  with whom she can now go into the big city without fear of people making fun of her.,HER,photo

PRAISE REPORT from World Medical Mission Post Residency Doctor Kristen Bracy: Almost Dead – “I was finishing up a C-section when one of my colleagues poked her head in the door  “Kristen  we have someone that was just brought to the hospital from the valley. She is hemorrhaging and her hemoglobin is 4. She delivered in the bush sometime this morning. The placenta is still inside  and we can’t get it out.”   She was rushed into the OR and I stood over the table praying for her as everything was prepared. These cases are in the hands of God. I know my limitations and how badly the odds are stacked against me. We finished the hysterectomy and the patient was still alive. This was a huge victory!   I went to see her the next morning. As I sat on the edge of her bed she looked up and smiled. I told her how thankful I was that she was alive because when she came to us she was almost dead. I told her about how we prayed over her and that her being alive had everything to do with God sparing her life. The patient’s husband was sitting beside her  and as we talked  I began telling them about Jesus. I began to describe His love for them and how He had orchestrated all of the details of that day so that she may live. She was hemorrhaging and when it became clear that she was in trouble everyone left her to die on her own. An ambulance driver from a sister clinic of ours happened to find her and out of his own expense brought her to our hospital.   After recounting all of these things her husband spoke up  “We need to know this Jesus. We have never heard of him before. When we go home we will find people that know about this Jesus so that we can know him too.” Yes! They got it! They understood. I spoke with some of the chaplains and hospital staff familiar with the area that this patient and her husband come from  and they have put them in contact with Christians in the area. “THIS IS WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT.”,HER,status

Prayer Point: As ISIS advanced this summer  they killed or enslaved many. Then they looted what was left behind by the 800 000 who managed to escape with their lives. Samaritan’s Purse quickly began responding to the crisis by meeting the immediate needs of families in the Name of Jesus Christ. In Erbil  for instance  Samaritan’s Purse gave food  a large power generator  tents  gas cooking stoves  mattresses  and later a playground to a camp of about 200 Assyrian/Chaldean Christian families from Qaraqosh. On October 13  Samaritan’s Purse airlifted 80 tons of relief including children’s clothing  winter jackets  blankets  kitchen kits  heavy-duty plastic for insulation  and more. Those materials  along with hundreds of thousands of shoes  were distributed over several weeks to displaced people fearful of winter’s freeze. Our staff and church partners  some of whom lost most of their worldly possessions when they had to flee the Mosul area themselves  are seeing God at work in surprising ways. They report a never-before-seen openness to the Good News among people groups to whom Christian believers previously had little access. “Now is the time to show Jesus—the Way  the Truth  the Life ” Pastor Samir said. He cited Joseph’s words in Genesis 50:20—“you meant evil against me; but God meant it for good”—and went on to say  “There are many people working for evil. Now is the time to work for love.”   Please pray for wisdom in how to meet the ongoing needs of displaced families. Also pray for people in Iraq to come to know Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.,HER,status

It makes me realize how easy it is for us to come to Christ in the West.  It costs us nothing like this. (Eventually it should cost us everything but  I lost no family over being baptized)  I remember as a child here  at a baptism  seeing the suitcases lined up because people realized being baptized meant they would no longer have a place to live.

Your prayers are appreciated  and it is strengthening for me to be able to tell her that she has family all over the world praying for her right now. ",HER,status

Prayer Point: They came to his home and told him  “If you say ‘Allah Akbar’ and commit to Islam  we will not take your money and your home.” “I cannot leave my religion ” Paul* said. So jihadists from ISIS took his money and his valuables  leaving him with just the clothes he was wearing. He joined thousands of other Christians in fleeing Mosul  also known as Nineveh plains.  The roads became so crowded with displaced families that a typical one-hour ride became a nine-hour test of endurance to reach Erbil. As these persecuted Christians and other religious minorities flooded into Erbil  they sought shelter any place they could- churches  schools  parks  unfinished buildings  even a mall. Samaritan’s Purse responded by providing food  water  shoes  and more.  Two hundred tents were distributed to provide temporary shelter. Thousands of mattresses and pillows were given to displaced families. One hundred cradles were provided to protect babies from biting ants on the ground. In one 48-hour period we worked with our partner to feed 14 000 people. Bibles were also provided to those who had to leave theirs behind. As of September  well more than 1 million Iraqis have been forced to flee their homes this year due to violence. Samaritan’s Purse continues to provide critical aid in Jesus’ Name to Christians and other displaced groups in the country as they simply try to survive another day.   Please pray for an end to the violence in Iraq and Syria. For many to be saved through the work of Samaritan’s Purse and our partners in the Middle East. For God to grant Christians around the world boldness  strength  and perseverance in the face of persecution.,HER,status

“If someone tries to harass me  I need to learn how to defend myself. My brother won’t be always around to protect me. I need to be independent.”  Nine-year-old Solaf had only been in Azraq refugee camp in Jordan for a few days when she saw other children her age running around in white robes. Curious  she followed them around to camp to find 50 boys and two girls participating in taekwondo training. She knew instantly she had to join them.   “When I saw the movements the kids were doing  I knew that was something I wanted to learn.”  Her parents support their multitalented daughter and raise her to realize she can achieve anything she wants to in life. And they’ve long known Solaf possesses a confidence not common in girls her age. With tears of pride in his eyes  her father told us of her strength back home in Syria:   “During a demonstration  she spoke to a camera while holding a rocket. She said ‘This is how you treat the children of Syria?’ She was just five years old  but her message was strong.”  Solaf’s curiosity and spirit continue to fuel her  even in exile. She’s also training in football and volleyball. And we can’t wait to see what’s next for her – go Solaf!,HER,photo
"What struck me most about the refugees I met is that they are just trying to move forward in their lives and provide for their families." - Ben Stiller   "It’s hard to imagine their situation – being totally displaced by the literal destruction of their homes and livelihoods by war  having to put their children’s lives in the hands of illegal traffickers and get on an overcrowded boat to try to reach Europe because there is no other way to reach safety. Yet despite all that has happened to them  they are focusing in a very practical way on the future  especially the future of their children."   Ben met refugee families  including Hassan  Nahed  and their children Mohamed and Mayyar  in Berlin last week. At the emergency shelter the Berlin district of Wilmersdorf  where the family are living at present  Ben discussed the situation in Germany  across Europe and the wider Syrian crisis.  Nahed and Hassan left Aleppo  Syria  in July 2015  making the heart-breaking decision to leave their home and business when the bombing became too much. They paid smugglers $1 200 per person to cross in the tiny boat to Greece. They are learning German and told Ben they hope to find work  a new home – and most importantly  get Mohamed and Mayyar back to school.  Learn more: http://trib.al/cKPnT7C,HER,photo

When families are forced to flee their homes  children are often the most affected. They leave behind everything that makes them feel safe: their homes  families  friends  communities and schools.  Deprived of education they are vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.  Investing in a refugee child’s education is an investment in their future – giving young lives meaning and hope for the future. Educated refugees provide leadership and the vital skills needed to rebuild their lives and communities.   Aqeela Asifi  the 2015 #NansenAward winner recognised this fact and made it her mission to bring education to hundreds of young girls in her refugee village  transforming their lives forever.  #education #refugees http://trib.al/Ov8eSnJ,HER,photo

Refugees arrived yesterday in Munich  Germany to a hero's welcome. All over the city  volunteers and officials welcomed thousands of refugees with applause  food and supplies. For them  it was something they saw as a happy influx. And at the end of the day  donations had outstripped the needs.  One volunteer said  “I am from Munich and for me personally it is very important to give these people the feeling of being welcome  to say: we are glad you made it here.”  The kindness and solidarity was not lost on the refugees who disembarked. One refugee woman  who nearly drowned in the Mediterranean Sea  spoke through teary eyes  “I feel good  I am breathing finally.”  We’re so moved by this display of solidarity and leadership. After all they have lived through  this is truly the welcome that refugees deserve.,HER,video

I’m here at the train station in Vienna and there are almost as many volunteers here as there are refugees arriving.

“Now we are breathing the air of freedom here."  Walid  a Syrian refugee in Hungary  helped organize some 1 000 refugees march out of Budapest towards the Austrian border. The group had walked 25 km when they stopped to rest. Hours later at 2am  Hungarian buses arrived to take them the rest of the way to Austria.   When the refugees spilled out of dozens of buses on the Austrian side of the border  they looked dazed  exhausted but guardedly happy. They were met by volunteers from the Austrian Red Cross and the Austrian Order of Malta holding handwritten signs saying 'welcome'  and handing out clothes  food  water and milk  blankets and rain gear.  We are thrilled by the decision of Austria and Germany to welcome the large number of refugees. It also warms our hearts to see the outpouring of support from civil society groups.

Join us in wishing Fadi and Rana a happy life and a prosperous future!  During Syria's war  these two have lost their homes  but found love. On July 12th they got married in the ancient  though now nearly destroyed St. George Church in Fadi’s old neighborhood of Al-Hamadieah  in Homs  Syria.

So ... I officially started my training as part of TEAM RMHC for the Chicago Marathon this weekend. On Saturday  I thought I'd start with a bang - I was like  "I'm going to run 13 miles today!" BUT about 8 miles in I had to give up cause I was so dehydrated. I was really discouraged - thinking I'm never going to be able to do a marathon - but then I thought - I have to take SMALL steps towards my BIG goal! Just like our RMHC families going through a tough time - it's the small wins along the way that add up to victory! With each mile I run & with every dollar I raise - I'm fighting to bring hope & support to the families that we serve! If you want to run with me make sure to visit www.rmhc.org/chicagomarathon to learn more!,LER,link

Today the Ohio Senate voted to defund Planned Parenthood  affecting the thousands of low-income patients that they see annually. When anti-abortion extremists spoke last week  they had no time limit. Planned Parenthood activists  patients and staff had to limit their testimony today.  Take note: Activists and patients in Ohio and across the country will NOT be silenced.,HER,photo
The National Abortion Federation's lawsuit against the militant  anti-abortion extremists behind those videos moved another step forward!   What's the lawsuit all about?

The so-called "Center for Medical Progress" has no shame. In their attempt to deny reproductive health care to millions of Americans  they stole a mother’s memorial video of her stillborn and peddled it as evidence of wrongdoing. Despicable.,HER,link

Win for Arizona women! A state court yesterday continued to block an extreme Arizona law that forces doctors to lie to patients by telling them that it's possible to “reverse” a medication abortion.

FACT: Most radiology machines and radiologists are in hospitals and radiology centers — not at a doctor's office or health center.

Passing this law would put women in unimaginable situations — needing to end a pregnancy for serious medical reasons  but unable to do so.

On Saturday  someone set fire to a car parked at a Planned Parenthood construction site in New Orleans.

Planned Parenthood does more every single day to prevent unintended pregnancy than any other organization. Meanwhile  anti-abortion rallies  internet trolls  and faux scandals do NOTHING for women's health — they only shame women with the aim of banning legal abortion and blocking women from living the life they choose to live.   This piece in The Economist gives us all something to think about: http://ppact.io/1I5xToJ,HER,photo
Cecile Richards tells it like it is: "While our opponents have been working to create scandal and panic where none exists  doctors and nurses at Planned Parenthood health centers have continued to provide care to thousands of women  men and young people every day — contraception  cancer screenings  testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections (STIs)  and safe and legal abortion.  Whose efforts are doing more to help families and make our country healthier?",HER,link
Well  this is a new low.    Today  anti-abortion extremists briefly blocked any traffic from going to plannedparenthood.org— a site that 200 000 people count on every day for health info and services.    If it wasn't clear that these attacks are an attempt to cut people off from care  an attack on the PP website makes it CRYSTAL clear. If you have a few bucks  please help PP fight back: ppact.io/helpfightback,HER,photo
The recent attacks on Planned Parenthood are nothing new. They just highlight the fact that opponents of PP will try anything to chip away at women's health care and abortion access in the United States. But a new poll shows that voters still see right through it. http://ppact.io/1h5fr6Q,HER,photo
This is right on. #standwithPP,HER,link
Politicians and extremists are so hell-bent on defunding Planned Parenthood — they don't care who it hurts or what it takes to do it. But while they spend their time trying to take away women's health care and rights  PP health centers have been busy actually providing quality health care to the people who need it.   If you stand with PP  now is the time to speak up! They're going to vote to defund PP soon: http://istandwithpp.org/,HER,photo

Cecile Richards set the record straight this morning with George Stephanopoulos: Anti-abortion extremists' three-year effort to entrap Planned Parenthood doctors was completely unsuccessful.  Moreover  the extremists behind the highly edited video attacks are part of the most militant wing of the anti-abortion movement — which has been behind the bombing of clinics  as well as the murder of doctors in their homes and in their churches.,HER,link
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell voted in 1993 to legalize fetal tissue donations after abortion. Now  he's trying to defund Planned Parenthood over the practice.   Are you as incensed as we are about the whole thing? TAKE ACTION→http://ppact.io/standwithfb.,HER,link
In the words of Sen. Patty Murray: “I am so disappointed—and truly angry that Republicans... leap[ed] at the opportunity to pander to their base  to poison the well with the political cable news battle of the day  and turn their backs on wounded veterans.”,HER,link
Democratic Presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton stood up for women's rights and reproductive freedom today at a campaign stop in South Carolina.  “I think it is unfortunate that Planned Parenthood has been the object of such a concerted attack for so many years ” she said. “And it’s really an attack against a woman’s right to choose  to make the most personal  difficult decisions that any woman would face  based on her faith and the medical advice that she’s given.”,HER,link
Finally  a call for investigation that actually makes sense. #StandWithPP,HER,link

A win for affordable birth control access→,HER,link
Today  a well-funded group established to damage Planned Parenthood promoted a heavily edited  secretly recorded video that falsely portrays Planned Parenthood’s participation in tissue donation.   Here are the facts: Just like every high-quality health care provider  Planned Parenthood lets patients donate tissue to scientific research. When they do  Planned Parenthood gets full consent under the highest ethical standards — with no financial benefit for them or Planned Parenthood.,HER,link

Happy 50th anniversary  legal birth control!   Today we're celebrating the June 7  1965 ruling of Griswold v.

Oooh  quickest birth control cost calculator EVER!   Since Obamacare guarantees no-copay insurance coverage  birth control is $0 out-of-pocket.

This is how the right to safe and legal abortion ends. Not all at once — but by politicians chipping away at access  inch by inch. The latest attack: a bill that would ban abortion at 20 weeks nationwide.   The reality is that nearly 99% of abortions take place before 21 weeks. And when abortion later in pregnancy does occur  it’s often due to complex circumstances. But if anti women’s health politicians can interfere with this decision  then they are one step closer to their real goal: banning abortion altogether. And when they target a small group of women  they erode the rights of every woman. We can't let them. Spread the word by sharing this ⬇️,HER,photo

Today is the anniversary of Roe v. Wade  a decision that has changed (and saved) women's lives — and this afternoon  the House voted to turn the clock back 42 years. Here's a special #TBT to let them know: We will never let them take us back. http://glmr.me/1BMvqic,HER,photo

Tonight  voters made clear that you can’t win elections in Colorado by openly opposing women’s health. That’s why voters decisively rejected the dangerous personhood amendment  and why Cory Gardner went to such great lengths to mask his own anti-women’s health record.   We’ve always known this year would be an uphill battle for incumbent women’s health champions and it's clear that focusing on women’s health kept this race much closer than it would have been otherwise.

Over the weekend  Barack Obama announced a ban on the sale of "virtually all ivory across state lines."   Here's how the new ban will prevent illegal ivory trade:,HER,link
BREAKING: President Obama just announced new rules limiting U.S. ivory sales!  If finalized  these new regulations would place a near-total ban on domestic ivory sales  imports  and exports of African elephant ivory.  More than 100 000 elephants were killed by poachers between 2010 and 2012  leading some scientists to predict that African forest elephants could be extinct within the decade. The United States is a significant market for ivory.  Following is a statement by NRDC President Rhea Suh: “The truth of the matter is that the United States plays a very real role in the slaughter of African elephants. Our trade and import of ivory is part of the demand that is driving the near-extermination of this species.  That’s why our country needs to do everything in its power to protect these endangered and iconic animals. “Restricting sales and helping to reduce demand is a critical part of the solution. Though we still have plenty of work to do to protect elephants for good  these new regulations take us one step closer.” #ivory #elephants #conservation,HER,photo

Whoa!! We have panda twins. 🐼🐼 Pandas often give birth to twins  but are usually only able to care for one at a time. For this reason  the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute team have pulled the second cub and have placed it in an incubator. The "panda twin protocol" calls for each cub to have time to bond with its mother  so keepers will carefully swap each cub out from time to time.   This method has been used successfully in China for many years. National Zoo animal care staff have traveled to China in previous years to receive training in the twin raising method,HER,photo

Today  June 6  in 1944  Allied forces descended upon the beaches of Normandy  France in what is known as D-Day.  The D-Day invasion began with a dangerous attack by American paratroopers. Dropped behind enemy lines to soften up the German troops and to secure needed targets  the paratroopers knew that if the accompanying assault by sea failed -- there would be no rescue.  While nearly 7 000 Allied navy and merchant vessels pushed toward the beaches of Normandy  overhead  12 000 bombers and fighter planes poured inland. Their coordinated actions secured an Allied foothold in France that helped lead to the end of World War II.

"For the first year I lived in the camp  I was depressed—I struggled to cope with the living conditions and the stress of trying to make sure my family was taken care of. But then one day I said to myself—I have to deal with this. I have to move on and rebuild. I changed my whole mindset and worked really hard—I was lucky enough to find a job  and I began to rebuild my sewing business  which was destroyed in Syria. I managed to save up and buy a sewing machine and now I have a backlog of orders. I consider myself an activist—not necessarily a political one  but I go out and help others—even in the camp. I have some medical training so I walk around to see if anyone is sick or wounded—I also assist doctors and EMTs from time to time. It has been a constant struggle  but now I am more powerful. I want my daughters to finish school. I want my business to grow. I want stability. And I am slowly making things happen.” — Dalal  a Syrian refugee living in Jordan whom the IRC spoke to in 2014.

Meet May and Eric. During the Gulf War  the couple were forced to flee their home country of Iraq  but were granted asylum and earned their citizenship in the United States. For 17 years  their Best Farmer’s Market has been an anchor in a Phoenix urban neighborhood where grocery stores and other retailers are scarce. The couple have adapted their market from serving the primarily Hispanic population when they first opened to now filling the needs of a growing refugee and African demographic.  Refugees supporting other refugees-- what a great example for us all.  May and Eric received a micro-enterprise loan through the IRC in Phoenix  funded through a Whole Planet Foundation Whole Foods Market grant.

Meet Ali. In 2011  when Ali was only five months old  a bomb fell and struck his home in Aleppo  one of Syria’s most war-ravaged cities. The blast left him with severe nerve damage that would affect his hearing.  After 4 years  his mother Fatima knew that the longer Ali had to wait for surgery  the less likely it would be that his hearing could be restored. “As he gets older  his situation gets worse ” she explained.  With time running out  Fatima and her husband decided to risk the sea journey to Europe  where they had heard Ali would have a better chance of getting help.   “For four years I fought for my son to come here ” she said. “Nothing will stop me from finishing this mission and helping my son.”  #RefugeesWelcome  Learn more about this incredible family: http://bit.ly/1KJuKMQ,HER,photo

In Aden  Yemen  IRC community health volunteers are spreading the word about basic health care services available to thousands through an IRC-managed clinic. This month  the IRC's Rebecca Blum accompanied volunteers to a local school  where many families have been living for months after fleeing their homes due to conflict. A volunteer approached a young mother and encouraged her to visit the health clinic's nutrition center because her daughter looked malnourished.    Within just a few hours  that mother arrived with her daughter  who was indeed malnourished and in need of medical treatment. After receiving a full checkup and a stock of Plumpy’nut  a therapeutic food to treat severe malnutrition  the little girl and her mother were on their way  promising to return for follow up visits.     Yemen has the second highest rate of malnutrition in the world  after Afghanistan  and the IRC is on the ground there to ensure that mothers and children like these have access to such life-saving care.,HER,photo

"If you are someone who cares about breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty  you need to play close attention to this next point. This year  one in every three TFA members is the very first in his or her family to graduate from college.

What happened in Ferguson is an absolute tragedy. Just one child denied the opportunity to live into his or her full potential is one child too many.  Our children should never have to live in fear  especially in their own community. As a nation  we must take meaningful action to always protect the dignity of every child; our future depends on it. As we continue to heal and comfort one another  we must teach our children to lead for a brighter tomorrow.  Our thoughts are with Michael’s family  friends and everyone in communities across Ferguson and throughout the nation.,HER,status

Over the years the Santa Barbara CA based Direct Relief Women of more than 200 women have come together with three goals in mind – educate  engage and fundraise for Direct Relief.    Putting together small events or gatherings that allow for speakers related to Direct Relief to share firsthand their stories and work has been a wonderful educational tool for both Direct Relief supporters and the local community. Partners such as Dr. Harshad Sanghvi have spoken and educated about low cost tools for safe deliveries and Dr. Edna Adan  a nurse and midwife from Somaliland has spoken to groups about the enormous challenges women face in delivering babies in Sub-Saharan Africa.    Direct Relief Women also do a lot of hands on activities such as packing personal care packs or dental kits in our warehouse that go to clinics  or assisting doctors and patients at a Direct Relief sponsored free dental clinic.    They’ve also helped raise a lot of money through their annual Mother’s Day event that they organize and promote. Last year  Direct Relief Women raised over $100 000 to support the Maternal Child Health programs at Direct Relief.    Through their focus on issues related to Maternal and Child Health  they are able to concentrate their efforts on a key issue for Direct Relief’s work and also an issue that is so close to the women’s own interests.  They have made a huge impact on our organization  our programs and to the people who are able to receive better health because of what they do.  We salute you and profoundly thank this group of dedicated  talented and thoughtful women!,LER,photo

The NYTimes ran an article today on Haiti's cholera epidemic  a disease that's spread through fecal contamination of water. Before the devestating earthquake  only 12% of the country had access to piped  treated water and after that number declined rapidly. That set up Haiti as a prime candidate for a cholera outbreak. Ten months after the quake  the country went from 0 cases of cholera to 3 500 dead in about 2.5 months.  Cholera is still a challenge for Haiti. This week  Direct Relief is giving Praecipio International a $20 000 grant to fund the Haiti Epidemic Advisory System (HEAS)--the world’s first National Weather Service-inspired infectious disease forecasting center. This grant will enable them to reactivate the network starting April 1 now that rainy season has begun in Haiti and early reports are already showing a rise in cases—as noted in the article.   The HEAS serves three basic functions:  1) issuance of forecasts for infectious diseases of medical or public health significance; 2) facilitation of the HEAS social network  which produces “live” situational awareness; and  3) facilitation of “switchboard operation” to rapidly connect warning to emergency response.   This will help to provide information to the various health actors around Haiti and lead to more rapid detection and confirmation and then response. It helps us at Direct Relief because we have pre-positioned in Haiti 6 cholera modules and 300 000 sachets of oral rehydration to respond immediately upon confirmation from the HEAS on a cholera spike.

Emergency preparedness packs were created by Direct Relief with input from experienced emergency responders  including physicians from the UCLA School of Medicine  the University of Pittsburgh  emergency field physicians from Australian Aid International  and representatives from the Santa Barbara Public Health Department and provided free of charge to Medical Reserve Corps members.  The packs are designed to include the most critical items for emergency medicine in a streamlined  “grab and go” backpack. The packs include supplies for infection control  diagnostics  trauma care  and personal protection. Cal EMSA has adopted Direct Relief’s EMT level MRC pack as the California State standard  and has asked Direct Relief to equip all current MRC units in California.     To date  Direct Relief has provided 1 235 Medical Reserve Corps (MRC) Med-Packs  to 15 MRC units across California  including those in Santa Barbara  Sacramento  San Diego  and Los Angeles.

Every Friday morning since 1988  the Holy Rollers (ranging in age from 55-92) gather at Direct Relief to wrap bandages that are made from donated sheets from two luxury hotels.  They rip the sheets into 1/4 and 1/2" strips  use a hand-made wooden dowel to begin the wrap (this allows the bandage to be wrapped extraordinarily tight which is needed for packing)  wrap the sheet and secure. The bandages are then packed and shipped worldwide. To date  over 250 000 have been sent.  There are currently 16 volunteers and a long waiting list to join. Wondering why it’s limited to 16?

CVCD is the only institution in Bolivia providing diabetes prevention  care & treatment services to patients regardless of their ability to pay. Since its founding in 2002 more than 100K Bolivians have been tested for diabetes & over 11K cases have been detected through the program.  CVCD works with The Abbott Fund which has provided funding for the past 5 years to purchase glucometers and test strips which allows for the screening of people in rural communities. Once people are identified with having diabetes  their information is recorded via iPad into a database and they’re referred to a CVCD Clinic.  In 2009 CVCD was named 1 of 6 International Diabetes Federation Centers of Education & in 2011 as one of World Diabetes Foundation’s Centers of Excellence.

In 2011  Kristof visited our work in Vietnam and met Phung for the first time. Moved by her determination to receive an education and succeed against the odds  he recently returned to see how Phung is faring at school and at home. Phung is a shining example of how an education can put a child on the path to success and help him or her chart a new course in life. End the cycle of inequality by investing in education.

Jennifer is a young woman confined to a wheelchair and homeless in Toronto.  Watching Jennifer's video  I get emotional - and then I get mad.   Jennifer has spent much of her young life on the streets. In her teens  she spent six years outside. This is now the second winter outside since Jennifer has had a wheelchair.    Homelessness is hard. Now imagine being disabled and most homeless services are not wheelchair user accessible. Jennifer can get into the lobby of the nearest shelter  but after that the stairs prevent her from further access.   Please take a few moments and watch Jennifer say her three wishes at the end  and then please share this video with everyone you know.  Stories like Jennifers need to be seen and never forgotten.

Donate here: https://www.razoo.com/us/story/Invisiblepeople-2016  INVISIBLE PEOPLE CONNECTS PEOPLE TO THE FACE OF HOMELESSNESS in a direct and meaningful way that humanizes & normalizes the subject and builds empathy in the viewer. This is achieved by 'raw'  unedited and unscripted stories of people experiencing homelessness as well as through the medium chosen (social media and the internet).  THIS IS WAY MORE IMPORTANT AND IMPACTFUL THAN SIMPLE AWARENESS. It's easy for homeless people to be an 'other'. Invisible People makes them real people with real stories. Once people are real  normal and sympathetic  it is easier for the general public to take action in support of ending homelessness. That action can be giving  donating  volunteering or voting. Empathetic awareness is critical to creating change.  DID YOU KNOW that Invisible People is the only national awareness and educational campaign on homelessness? Just turn on the TV and you'll see anti-smoking ads  don't text and drive videos are all over the internet  and awareness campaigns from the need to recycle to global warming are everywhere we look  and they should be. Yet except for Invisible People  there are zero campaigns teaching the general public the truth about homelessness.  THE GENERAL PUBLIC RECEIVES MAJORITY OF THEIR EDUCATION ON HOMELESSNESS FROM NONPROFIT FUNDRAISING MATERIALS. Nonprofits flood mailboxes  inboxes and social media with marketing materials crafted with the sole purpose of acquiring donors. The information presented in fundraising materials is not always the truth  yet the vast majority of the general public accept this information as fact. The problem with this is  the public is misinformed and wrong stereotypes are reinforced through fundraising materials. This creates more nimbyism (not in my backyard) and more support for criminalization  which is increasing across the country. All this while one side is saying they are reducing homelessness  while the other side is calling for a State of Emergency to be declared because they have never seen homelessness so bad. This is why it's harder than ever to find support to help fight homelessness  and why Invisible People's work is important. .  This year I turn 55 years-old. 55 is kind of a big number and most birthday campaigns ask for donations based on the age. I am simply asking for a donation of any size. Every and any amount counts  and WITHOUT YOUR SUPPORT  THERE WOULD BE NO INVISIBLE PEOPLE.  Our work stops without you!  ***Your donation is tax deductible,HER,video

Ron is a disabled Vietnam veteran homeless in Boston.  This time  he has been without a home for five months. Ron was in transitional housing  but he says they were not helping and only taking his money.   Ron says he's living moment to moment while hoping for the best  yet he says that never happens.   Ron's story breaks my heart. No one should have to live on the streets homeless  and especially not the men and women who bravely served our country. It's interesting that cities around the U.S. are claiming they have put an end to veteran homelessness  and there has been a lot of progress  but the real truth is many veterans are still without a home and we still have a lot of work to do.,HER,video
It was not hard to notice Alexander was living homeless in Boston. He was carrying most everything he owned on his back.  Before I started the camera  I asked Alexander how long he was on the streets. He responded: "seven years as a woman  and now two years as a man".  What I didn't see from a distance is Alexander is a transgender male.   Alexander's story is important because homelessness is a critical issue for transgender people  with one in five having experienced homelessness at some time in their lives because of discrimination and family rejection. To me  Alexander's story is heartbreaking  and I so admire his courage to be so open.  Because Alexander is still in transition going from a woman to a man  homeless shelters will not provide services  leaving his only choice to be sleeping outside. Also  he is caught in the housing bureaucracy madness.  Alexander has been on a housing waiting list since 2012!  This interview is a little longer than most  but it's an important conversation  and I hope you'll watch to the end. Alexander has been caught in a perpetual cycle of frustration for eight and a half years now  and he says if it continues for another eight years it will be "twenty years waiting to be housed. Twenty years waiting to be me  and twenty years at the same income level".   *For more please visit: Transgender Homelessness and My Visit with TRANS: THRIVE  http://invisiblepeople.tv/blog/2012/04/transgender-homelessness-and-my-visit-with-trans-thrive/,HER,video

Douglas is a disabled veteran living on the streets of Hollywood. He sleeps on the sidewalk every night.  Douglas says wherever he lays his head is home.   There is a big push in this country to end veteran homelessness  and there should be. Douglas is disabled and confined to a wheelchair. He is missing one leg. Clearly there is something wrong if Douglas is calling a sidewalk home.   Service providers have offered Douglas a bed in a shelter  but he finds the streets to be safer. During my Los Angeles trip  I ran into a few people who should not be homeless on Hollywood Blvd  and they were also only offered shelter  yet returned to the streets. I know the folks in Hollywood working to end homelessness and they are giving their all  but obviously  they are not being provided the tools or housing needed to help these people.  All of the folks I met received disability income and qualify for housing  but of course  there has to be housing available.   Douglas says he loves our country  but he feels our government sucks.  Knowing Douglas slept outside the night of this interview  I have to agree with him.   What do you think?,HER,video

Upon arrival I found a scared older man huddled in a corner in the worst possible condition a human being can be. I took Lanny back to our facility and offered him a shower and some clean clothes.   Over the next few years Lanny and I became close friends. I would look for him almost every day when I was working outreach  and when I was traveling with Invisible People  Lanny would inquire with my co-workers asking for information about my return.   I committed to getting Lanny off the streets. It took 3 and a half years to get him into housing  but once he had his own place that provided personal dignity  the transformation for the better was immediate.   This video on Housing First helps share that part of the story http://invisiblepeople.tv/housingfirst   Lanny passed away this week. Last time I hung out with Lanny was last January.  I stopped by his apartment and took him to dinner.   Although I am saddened by Lanny's death  I know he had a good life in his very own apartment the last few years.   Lanny is proof we can end homelessness. There are a lot more Lanny's still on the street. We MUST do everything we can to end homelessness for EVERYONE!   Lanny changed my life in ways. I am grateful for the bond we developed. Lanny will be missed.   Good-bye Lanny. I love you!  Mark,HER,video

Arthur is a Vietnam era veteran who lives in the woods near Ithaca  New York.  A relationship gone bad and the high cost of housing left him no choice but to make a home outside.   Something as simple as making a cup of coffee in the morning takes Arthur 45 minutes. Think about that for a moment. Would you wait in line at Starbucks even 15 minutes for a Caramel Macchiato? It really hit me when I was helping Arthur work his cart down the trail.  While Arthur pushed I had to lift up the front so the wheels wouldn't dig into where the trail was soft. It was challenging to say the least  and I could not stop thinking that he makes this journey several times a day every single day!   President Obama has mandated that we will end veteran homelessness by the end of this year. That's a very good thing. Many communities are claiming that they have ended veteran homelessness.  I really want to believe them  but the real truth is there are many still experiencing homelessness and soldiers from Middle East hitting the streets every day. There has been noticeable progress   but stories like Arthur's only prove we still need to do more!,HER,video

Shelly is homeless in Hollywood  but she refers to herself as a "canner that sleeps outside". Shelly survives by recycling cans. She says it's just a band-aide until the economy gets better. Thing is  Shelly has been doing this for far too long  and the longer someone is on the street  the harder it is to transition back into a normal life.   Shelly has done a lot of traveling looking for work. At the time of this interview  she was sleeping in an ally. Shelly uses cardboard to sleep on. She says Amazon must be doing really well because she find so many boxes with the Amazon logo.   I have sat here for a bit looking at Shelly's photo. I can't image what she goes through on the streets of Los Angeles just to survive. Although she exudes a smile  that small layer of happiness is covering years of pain.,HER,video

Click here: https://www.crowdrise.com/sober20years This August 24th I will have 20 years sober. It's nothing short of a miracle that I have even 1 day sober -  much less coming up on 20 years. I was one of the "worst of the worst" drug addicts you will ever find. But...I am also proof that when given a chance people's lives can and will change for the better.  To help celebrate my 20th sober birthday I am asking everyone to please help Invisible People fight homelessness by donating $20. If just 500 people give $20 we will raise our goal of $10 000. I know that's not an awful lot  but Invisible People continues to do a lot with a little. Our impact is directly proportionate to the support we raise.  PLEASE READ THIS NEXT PARAGRAPH:  "The stereotypes of people living in poverty throughout the United States are among the most negative prejudices that we have.

I strongly believe that if the general public viewed our homeless neighbors as being the real people that they are  there wouldn't be such humiliation and violence against people experiencing homelessness! Awareness and education on homelessness can change that  and your support in funding Invisible People is breaking wrong stereotypes and changing how tens of millions of lives view homeless individuals.  DID YOU KNOW that Invisible People is one of the only national awareness and educational campaign on homelessness? Just turn on the TV and you'll see anti-smoking ads  don't text and drive videos are all over the internet  and causes from the need to recycle to global warming are everywhere we look  and they should be. But except for Invisible People  there are zero campaigns teaching the general public about homelessness.,HER,video

“How can you rebuild a life you’ve never had” ~ Mike  Mike has been on the streets since he was 13 years-old. The powerful quote from Mike validates why we need to focus on ending street homelessness and youth homelessness at the same time  and not just one or the other.  The night before we met  someone stole his backpack with everything he had for his dog.  This is a very powerful video. Mike talks about how people judge him for being homeless  and then judge that he can't take care of his dog. Honestly  most of the general population care more about pets then to do homeless people. Time and time again I've seen people literally freak out over a homeless dog completely ignoring the homeless person.  Mike also shares about how lines outside a store are celebrated  yet homeless people just cannot sit on a sidewalk.  Listen to Mike's second wish. It's very powerful!,HER,video
"How can you rebuild a life you've never had" ~ Mike (homeless since 13 years-old)   What Mike said is spot on why we need to end street homelessness and youth homelessness. Focusing on just one or the other will not end homelessness. We need to close the "front door" and the "back door"!,HER,photo

John is sleeping outside in Philadelphia. He tried shelters  but someone stabbed John trying to steal his boots  so he feels safer sleeping on the streets even though the overnight windchill is reported to be a deadly -11° or worse.   John had a great job in the telecommunications industry fixing police and fire communication systems. He fell on the job  which resulted in serious injuries. John was in a coma for some time  and he claims his homelessness is a result of insurance industry abuse. Clearly John is disabled  yet he has not been approved for disability benefits. John is vulnerable  and he should not be on the streets - period!   Moments before we met John   a woman spit on him simply because John asked her for a cigarette. Like most urban centers anymore  downtown Philadelphia is filled with large groups of homeless people nestled up alongside fancy restaurants  pricey shopping  and executive offices. This mixture of two extremely different socioeconomic classes can be volatile at times. I don't agree with this woman's actions  but something in the past  aggressive panhandling or an intoxicated homeless person verbally assaulting her could have influenced such awful behaviors. We must get people experiencing homelessness the help they need  and we need more funding for educational and awareness campaigns to change public perceptions about homelessness.

This year I turn 54 years-old. 54 is kind of a big  number and most birthday campaigns ask for donations based on the age.  So let's cut my age in half. If each and every one of you could simply  make a donation of $27 it would go a long way to reaching our goal. Of  course   if you would like to donate $54 000  or even $5 400 please do. I  am being a little funny. The truth is $5  $10  $25  $54 - any and every  amount counts. This is the one campaign that fuels Invisible People  throughout the year and we desperately need your support to help end  homelessness.  Thank you in advance for your time and support ,HER,video

Christine works at McDonalds overnight and her daughter works there during the day. They are working homeless: living in a weekly rate hotel and splitting shifts so one of them is there to take care of the younger children.  It's a vicious cycle.  Minimum wage does not allow them enough money to afford first and last months rent to move out of the hotel  nor does it allow for them to afford babysitters.   If they stop working or get sick  they end up on the streets or a homeless shelter. 5 people living in one small hotel room is now the new American Dream because in many ways... it's now the new middle class!  If you haven't noticed watching the videos on this site  the interviews that mess me up the most you can tell by the space between my questions. Plus  that I just can't concentrate enough to ask questions. This story messed me up and I almost forget to ask Christine about her 3 wishes. My heart goes out to every family trying to survive in poverty. I wish I could simply take all their pain away.  Special thanks to Paul Kruse http://firststepbackhome.net,HER,video

The heavy rain just stopped.  The tent Christine and two other people are living in near St Louis was almost collapsed and in desperate need a repair.  Christine got out of the tent and we started to talk. She said her dream was to get her poems published. I asked her to recite one and her poem "I Am From" was so beautiful I asked her if she'd share it with all of us...and she agreed!   Christine is only 21 years-old and has been homeless in St Louis since aging out of foster care.,HER,video

Moon sleeps in an abandoned building someplace near New Orleans. Earlier today  he had to take his pup to the veterinarian  and that took every cent he had. When I met him  he told me he had raised $2 in the last hour.   Moon had a job  but hurt his back. He was not able to go on disability because they said it was his fault.  Without income it was only a matter of time before he became homeless.   Earlier today I had a chat with a local outreach team that focuses on abandoned buildings.  When I asked the person if he knew what I did he responded "ya we have housed a few people in your videos".  My hope is Moon will be one of them soon!,HER,video

Tammy has been "jumped" twice by kids and adults going on a rampage setting fires and abusing homeless people  but that's not the least of her worries. She has lived in the tent you see behind her for a few years and soon the city will be bulldozing the land because of new construction.   For Tammy  even with the dangers she feels safer living in a tent community than at a shelter.  She calls the community her family and in many ways they become one.   I was with an outreach team in Columbus  Ohio checking on all the "campers" to see if everyone had any needs and to place people on a housing list. Their goal is to get everyone the support they need before the tent community is eradicated.  I hope and pray Tammy makes it into a housing program.

He has been to the emergency room  yet needs to qualify for SSI or SSDI to get help he needs. The quickest workers can get him in to see a doctor is over a month away. I am not an expert  but to me Richard is vulnerable. If he does not find help soon he will die homeless.,HER,photo
Imagine working all your life and then in your senior years the only option for retirement is living in a park. When we recorded this interview   Dennis was a few months shy of turning 60 years-old and had been experiencing homelessness for a little less than 5 months.   Dennis said  "I used to make fun of the homeless until I became one"  which should stand out as a reminder to all of us that homelessness can happen to anyone.   A divorce changed his living situation. Dennis then developed health issues and stayed in a board and care until the high cost forced him to transition to a winter shelter program. When the winter shelter closed  Dennis had no other options except to sleep outside.   We have a "Silver Tsunami" coming.  Boomer generation is now entering into what should be their comfortable retirement years. Instead  because this last recession wiped out a lot more than hopes and dreams  seniors will enter into homelessness at an alarming rate.    Distributed by OneLoad.com,HER,video

After returning from tours of Iraq and Afghanistan  Michael found himself back in America with a drug and alcohol addiction  which quickly led to job loss and then homelessness.   Michael is homeless in Syracuse "flying a sign" on a subzero winter day just to get a few dollars to survive. Weather report at the time of this interview was around minus 15 °F. I had to take my gloves off just for a moment to setup the camera  and the tips of my fingers burned like they were on fire for the next half hour. Michael said he had been standing there for two hours. Luckily  Catholic Charities is providing shelter for him at night  but the day before on the same corner I gave socks and gloves to a man who is sleeping outside during this weather.    When I asked Michael what he wanted the world to know about being a homeless veteran he responded: " for a person to be homeless it's a shame  for a veteran to be homeless it's a tragedy."

Jonahlisa is a homeless youth in New York City. She says there are times you just want to break down and give up.   Jonahlisa says she has been homeless most of her life. At 2  her mother placed her in foster care and she then bounced from placement to placement. Jonahlisa experienced her first night of street homelessness at 9 years-old. To me  just the thought of any child that young on the streets messes me up.   The good news is Jonahlisa is a Covenant House  one of my favorite youth programs. Jonahlisa now has a job  and thanks to a program run by Jonahlisa- she will soon have her own apartment and will be going to school.     Special thanks to Hanes and Covenant House       .

This video you MUST watch to the end. Normally  after I ask someone for their 3 wishes - we end. But Brion didn't want any wishes  and when he started to explain why  he opened up about his childhood and growing up in foster care.   Brion got back from the army after being discharged for health reasons. His mom asked him for his money so she could buy drugs. When Brion said no  his mother went to the police to have him removed from her apartment.   Brion is a homeless youth in Pittsburgh. Some nights it was safer to stay up all night then to fall asleep and become vulnerable.    At around 3 minutes in to this video Brion shares candidly about the problem of putting a child into different foster care placements. Brion was placed into his first foster home at 9  and says he was in 13 placements until he aged out at 18. Now at age 20  Brion says everyone who grows up with that much inconsistency becomes a product of the "system"!  Sadly  Brion's story is very common. According to California Progress Report  65% of youth in foster care emancipate without a place to live. 40% of persons living in homeless shelters are former foster children. A similarly disproportionate percentage of the nation’s prison population is comprised of former foster youth. Less than 3% go to college and 51% are unemployed.  The good news is that although the story of a broken foster care system is common  young men like Brion are not. I cannot predict the future  but I can almost guarantee Brion is going to put all the madness behind him and have an amazing life!

WARNING: This video will mess you up!   Being on a road trip focusing on homeless youth it was important to tell the story of the homelessness you don't see - the millions of American families living in weekly rate hotels just barley one step from street homelessness. In fact  when I met this wonderful family today  they were packing up to leave and live in their car. The hotel had given them one day's grace  but they were completely out of money with no place to go. I am still emotional thinking about it even hours later. Truth is  thousands upon thousands of families face being evicted from a hotel to the streets every single day! This family was lucky. I tweet out what I call a "Hail Mary" and a generous heart stepped up and donated a weeks stay. That too messed me up!   Michael  Danielle  and their six children live in one hotel room near St Louis. Michael works a full time job  and they used to rent a house  but their landlord didn't pay the mortgage. After the bank took the property back  Michael  Danielle  and their six children were evicted with no place to go.   Hotel homelessness becomes a trap. Hotel's cost more than an apartment  but you can move right in without deposit  and a hotel room is far better than the streets. Once in  people who are considered the working poor  have an impossible time trying to save up enough money to afford adequate housing. Often these hotels are not a good place for kids to grow up.   There is a lot of emotion in this video. I get messed up throughout  but when the parents start talking about having to run in to the bathroom to cry so the kids don't see - I'm done! I am pissed that families have to live like this and heartbroken because I can literally feel their pain. I don't speak about this much  but I was raised by my mother and we went through some hard years when I was young.   If I could get you to watch just one video all the way to the end  and then share  this would be that video. This family is filled with strength and love  and has the courage to share their very real story about the homeless you don't see  but need to see!   Huge thanks to the generous donor who helped pay for another week's hotel for this family.

"Some days people are nice and come up  give you food or money. Other days just wonder past and just not care" is how George responded when I asked him how he survives sleeping rough in London.   George has been on the streets 2 months this time. He went into a hostel for 10 months  and before that he was homeless for 7 months. George felt he wasn't getting the support he needed. Unfortunately  support for homeless services continues to be cut while demand keeps increasing. The good news is an outreach team continues to work with George and I hope they find the help he needs to get off and stay off the streets.    .Distributed by OneLoad.com,LER,video
