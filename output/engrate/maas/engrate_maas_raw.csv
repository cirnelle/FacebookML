Thursday 15 to Sunday 18 August  10am to 5pm Tickets: free with Museum entry   Everybody knows about the Powerhouse Museum’s Young Blood markets which were launched in 2005 as part of Sydney Design. It was one of the first designer markets in Sydney and the only design market which was presented in a vibrant museum setting. Markets are an important launch pad for emerging designers but as a museum dedicated to ‘unpacking’ design in all its manifestations  we now feel its time to crank it up a notch and give you the chance to see inside a designer’s studio.   Studio Pop-ups will continue to support the work of local designers whilst offering you a deeper and more meaningful experience with the design process. Discover how a jeweller makes each piece  learn about contemporary technologies  processes  systems and equipment and find out first hand what motivates and inspires designers or hear about changes in their field.   Studio Pop-ups presents ten carefully selected design studios – as pop ups. Designers are selling their products and also offering you the chance to see how it’s done. Each studio is housed in a specially-designed pop up stall located inside the Museum. Studio Pop-ups is the perfect opportunity to be a part of the design conversation and to learn more about the design process. Where else can you buy your favourite designer’s work  have a go at the creative process yourself and go home with a deeper knowledge and understanding of how it was made?  http://www.sydneydesign.com.au/2013/event/studio-pop-ups-3/

We thought we would share some facts about one of the most beautiful and important natural resources on the planet:  • Humans drink an average of 75 000 litres of water in our lifetime. • 97.5% of the Earth's water is saltwater found in oceans and seas. • Of all the water on Earth  97.5% is saltwater  2.5% is fresh water but most of that is ice. Less than 1% of all the water on Earth is usable fresh water.  • Making a year's supply of plastic bottles costs the Earth 913 litres of water and 427 kilowatt-hours of energy. It also produces about 6 kilos of landfill.  You can learn more at our Ecologic exhibition or at http://www.unwater.org/worldwaterday

Legend in Japan has it that Vega (Orihime) misses her husband Altair (Hikoboshi) who has been marooned on the other side of the Milky Way  the river in the sky  by her father. Once a year magpies build a bridge over the Milky Way so the two can be together for just one day. A sad but lovely story. Both stars are visible now on this cold winter night. Vega is very low in the north and the fifth brightest star in the night sky. Altair is about 40 degrees above the northwest horizon at 11pm. It is the twelfth brightest star in the night sky. From the countryside you should be able to see the Milky Way between them. The woodblock print showing the festival was copied from Wikipedia.

As the Moon orbits the Earth in a slightly elliptical orbit  the closest monthly approach known as perigee will be 356 991km at 21:12 AEST. At nearly the same time  the Moon will be full at 21:32 AEST.   Recently  this potentially pretty combination of a full moon near the same time as perigee has been dubbed the “Supermoon”.  Weather permitting  this seems like a good time not only to enjoy the view but to test an odd idea about the size of the Moon as we see it.  Have you ever noticed that Moon looks so much larger when it rises than when it appears high overhead? The Moon  the Sun and even the constellations suffer from the same magnification near the horizon  or do they?  Here in Sydney  the full moon rises at 16:50 AEST at a compass bearing of 101 degrees  or about 114 degrees East of true North. This is 4 hours and 42 minutes before it is full and 4 hours and 22 minutes before its closest approach.  There is no doubt it will be the biggest full moon of the year but is it really bigger when it is close to the horizon than when it is high overhead?  So here is your challenge. Find a stiff piece of clear plastic (or cardboard if that’s all you can find) and have a marker pen ready. You will also need a clear view to the East to see the Moon rise. Just as the Moon clears the horizon  hold the piece of plastic at arm's length and mark off the Moon’s apparent diameter. Enjoy the view before retreating back inside where it’s warm and perhaps read one of our other blog posts. Go back outside 3 to 6 hours later  if you can stay up that late  and repeat the measurements. Make sure you record which set of marks was taken at what time  and include the date.  Now measure with a ruler the two sets of marks and compare.  Did the Moon actually get smaller as it rose  or did it get bigger or stay the same within the limitations of our simple exercise?  On 24 June we will post a call for your answers on our Facebook page - just reply with your answer  'SMALLER'  'BIGGER' or 'SAME'.  Most importantly  don’t throw out the piece of plastic as we will use it again for the 'Minimoon' on 16 January 2014 when the full moon occurs near apogee at about 403 532km away.  Good luck.

However it is possible to safely watch the eclipse if you have a small telescope or a pair of binoculars – but to look at a projection of the Sun instead of looking through the instrument at the Sun.   Use the telescope (for safety  remove the finderscope first) or the binoculars to project the image  as shown in the diagram. With your back to the Sun  aim the telescope towards it (this is not as difficult to do as it sounds – use the shadow of the telescope) and focus its image onto a white card held about 20 cm behind the eyepiece.   DO NOT LOOK THROUGH THE TELESCOPE OR ITS LITTLE FINDERSCOPE! Never leave the telescope unattended and ensure that children are supervised at all times. Viewing the projected image is quite safe  but looking through the telescope or binoculars will cause almost instant blindness!

The Moon will only be a very thin crescent whereas Venus will be a very bright point of light. They will both then set together in the west at around 10:30pm. You will also notice that Venus is very bright. Venus is at maximum brightness tonight. There are two main factors affecting the brightness of Venus - one is how close Venus is to the Earth and the other is the relative position of Venus to the Sun as viewed from Earth. The combination of these two factors has resulted in the brightness of Venus increasing over the past few weeks to a maximum brightness tonight  after tonight it will slowly start to fade back to usual levels.

To see the aurora borealis from Lapland and comet ISON from the USA. So far so good. On the flight from Singapore to Helsinki I woke and looked out towards Ursa Major  the Big Bear  Big Dipper or Wagon as some call it. The sky was amazingly clear at 12000m as you would expect. Just below and to the west was a faint but observable aurora. The technical term was “Yippee!”. So  by holding the camera hard against the window then shrouding it by using my jacket I was able to get a few shots of around 4 seconds before movement became too much on an issue. This shot was taken while above Russia. Some towns can be seen below the thin cloud cover.  While the camera was taking the dark frame after this image a very bright meteor shot through the field of view  D’oh about 4 seconds too late. No colour was visible to the eye but the camera (Canon 6D at ISO 6400) caught the beautiful pinks and later some greens. The curtain nature was clearly visible and I kept shooting until the battery was flat ☹. In another hour I will arrive in Helsinki then an overnight train to Rovaniemi for some more aurora  hopefully. All I need is for the Sun to continue to shoot charged particles at us at around 400km/s and some clear sky. Let me know if you want o see more of my astro-journey over the next two months. Toodles Geoff of the Obs.

My colleague was able to look at it with our biggest telescope and said he could see a star-like object next to the cloud.

Solar and lunar eclipse are the most well know examples of a syzygy  three celestial bodies in a line but there are other types too. Tomorrow  Monday 4 August the Moon will be directly between us and the jewel of the night sky – Saturn. This is known as an occultation and they can be surprisingly common with 11 visible somewhere around the Earth this year. For Sydney-siders it will be the third this year though the first in Feb was during the day. The last was on May 14 and the next one after Aug won’t be until ANZAC day 2019.   So what will you see? Look to the West from around 8:45pm and locate the Moon in the constellation of Libra. About ½ a degree above  or half the width of your outstretched pinkie at arm’s length  look for a slightly yellow star-like object  Saturn. Over the next half hour the Moon will sink lower into the west but more slowly than Saturn and the gap between the two will close. At 9:22pm AEST the rings will kiss the dark limb of the Moon and then the planet will vanish for just under an hour. This first part  the disappearance  will be easy to see as Saturn won’t be overpowered by the bright part of the Moon.   At 10:13pm Saturn will reappear near Mare Australe (Southern Sea) when the Moon is just 30 degrees above the western horizon. At first Saturn will be hard to see in the glare of the Moon but well worth a try especially if you have a pair of binoculars or a small telescope.   We hope to broadcast the event live from the North dome telescope via our webpage  weather permitting  so please follow the link on our main page at www.sydneyobservatory.com.au  from 8:45pm onwards.

For us in Sydney the Moon will cover 52% of the Sun’ diameter at 5:15pm.   Weather permitting we hope to broadcast this live through a new and very powerful solar telescope. If you don’t have the correct eclipse glasses or filters PLEASE DO NOT TRY TO MAKE YOUR OWN ! (Yes we are shouting as it is so important to be careful).  The eclipse will start at 4:14pm AEST and the maximum will be at 5:15pm just two minutes before the Sun sets.   We have no doubt that some will try to take a “safe” unfiltered peek at the Sun when it sits low on the horizon but this MUST NOT be done. Permanent irreversible eye damage can be the dreadful result!   Please share this with as many people as you can. It is a beautiful event if viewed safely. More details to come :)

Sadly for us in the South this is not a good chance to see meteors  but there are no guarantees either way. If anyone is keen to try you will need a perfectly clear view to the North with little to no light pollution over the next few nights. Look for the bright star Vega as shown in the map. It rises at around midnight but the part of the sky you need to see is BELOW that  so you need to wait until around 3am. Even at this time the radiant (apparent point source of the meteors) will be below the horizon. If the conditions are good you may see a meteor or two or...  Don't forget we can see around 6 per hour on any night. The best time is always a few hours before sunrise and look eastward. Good luck. BTW check spaceweather for the latest images.

Look East and hour or two before Sunrise (6:30am AEDT) and it should be rather obvious just below the teapot of Sagittarius. At magnitude -4.6 it is about 25 times brighter than Sirius the dog star  brightest of the night time stars. A small telescope or good binoculars will show its crescent shape of about 25%. This is also a good chance to try some simple astro- night-scape photography. You don't need a huge telephoto lens as it's all about composition. Make sure your camera  preferably an SLR is mounted on a solid tripod. Open the lens aperture as wide as possible  ie small number like f2. Increase the ISO but not too much and you will need to see what is best for your camera and location. Use mirror lock if possible and a cable release to minimise vibrations. Try several different exposures and most importantly check the focus. It should be set to infinity (looks like an '8' on its side) but not all lenses are focused to infinity when the symbols say so. Take some test exposures and blow them up to check. Lastly make sure you share your results with us :)

Do you remember the story of Hansel and Gretel and the part where they left a trail? Well it’s a bit of a stretch but I think the asteroid 3200 Phaethon is an astronomical analogue of sorts. Over the next few days the Earth will move into the dust trail left behind by the asteroid and that signals the start of the of the annual Geminid meteor shower. Dust trails are usually a trait of comets but it has been suggested that as the asteroid travels close to the Sun it warms  cracks and ejects dust which must be bad for the asteroid but good for us watching from afar. Tiny pieces of dust hit Earth's atmosphere travelling at up to 32 km/s and disintegrate completely 73 km above Earth's surface. They appear as short sharp streaks of light coming from the region of the sky around the constellation of Gemini the twins  hence the name- Geminids. Expected to peak in the early mornings of December 13-14 observers in dark locations away from city lights in the northern hemisphere might see as many as 120 meteors per hour. So what will we see? Not as many but it is still the best chance for us all year. By the way  some think they may peak earlier so if you are up late or early (~1am onwards) look northward towards Gemini and good luck.

Unfortunately there was one big beam of light coming from around Circular Quay which pierced the night sky.

The Museum has also purchased a very special telescope  with an articulated eyepiece able to easily adjust to different heights for easy viewing of the night sky for people in wheelchairs. (This telescope is one of several in the world and the only one in the Southern Hemisphere!)  Another exciting aspect of the project is that the new building will house an exhibition  developed by MAAS  titled ‘Accessing the Sky’ which will highlight Sydney Observatory’s participation in the 1887 Carte du Ciel (Chart of the Sky) and Astrographic Catalogue projects to photograph and chart the entire celestial globe.  For more information about the new dome  read our blog posts here http://goo.gl/ERuuDw and here http://goo.gl/gM9xGN.

Well have a look at this short video from NASA. https://www.youtube.com/embed/oWCWwEv_LcI?enablejsapi=1&rel=0   NASA technologies are being used to locate underground water in some of the driest places on the Earth  build quieter and more fuel-efficient airplanes  and create shock absorbers that brace buildings in earthquakes. The 2015 edition of NASA’s annual Spinoff publication highlights these and other technologies whose origins lie in space exploration  but now have broader applications.     “The game-changing technologies NASA develops to push the envelope of space exploration also improve our everyday lives ” said NASA Chief Technologist David Miller. “Spinoff 2015 is filled with stories that show there is more space in our lives than we think.” Spinoff 2015 tells the story of shock absorbers used during space shuttle launches that are now being used to brace buildings during earthquakes  preventing damage and saving lives. The book also features a NASA-simplified coliform bacteria test that is being used to monitor water quality in rural communities around the world  as well as cabin pressure monitors that alert pilots when oxygen levels are approaching dangerously low levels in their aircraft. Published every year since 1976  Spinoff offers a close-up look at how NASA's initiatives in aeronautics and space exploration have resulted in technologies with commercial and societal benefits across the economy  in areas such as health and medicine; transportation; public safety; consumer goods; energy and environment; information technology; and industrial productivity. These spinoffs contribute to the country’s economic growth by generating billions of dollars in revenue and creating thousands of jobs. “NASA enjoys a large and varied technology portfolio unlike any other in existence ” said Daniel Lockney  NASA’s Technology Transfer program executive. “And the range of successful technology transfer documented in Spinoff each year is as diverse as NASA’s many science and exploration missions.” The publication also includes a “Spinoffs of Tomorrow” section showcasing 20 industry-ready NASA technologies -- from smart coatings that protect metal from corrosion to an identity verification system that uses the human heartbeat as a “fingerprint” -- that are all available for licensing. NASA’s Technology Transfer Program is charged with finding the widest possible applications of agency technology. Through partnerships and licensing agreements with industry  the program ensures NASA’s investments in pioneering research find secondary applications that benefit the economy  create jobs  and improve quality of life.

It’s Supermoon Wednesday today  21 Jan 2015! What does that mean? Not much really unless you’re a mosquito but we want to share to avoid some confusion. The term ‘Supermoon’ is relatively new as astronomers prefer ‘perigee moon’ ie when the full or new moon is closest in its monthly orbit of Earth. The word perigee is from French and earlier Greek peri meaning close and gea from Gaia meaning Earth  hence close to Earth. Today’s Supermoon however is new moon so we don’t see a thing except perhaps the effect of the tides  big tides at that. In Sydney Harbour today at 9:35am AEDT the high tide was 2m! Apparently such spring or king tides can lead to salt water flowing into marshy areas and creating perfect conditions for mosquitoes to breed  darn. You won’t be able to see the Moon however tonight or tomorrow as it’s too close to the Sun however Friday night  weather and mozzies permitting  there should be a nice crescent moon setting in the West around 21:52.

If today remains clear and it's looking good now  tonight is probably the best chance for us in the south to see comet Lovejoy high in our night sky. About now it is as close to Earth as it will be for the next 8000 years at ~70 million km away. Over the next few weeks it moves closer to the Sun and brightens but further from us :( From our point of view it will also head towards the northern sky making it harder to see. Our friends in the north may be in a for a great view but comets are notoriously difficult to predict so we will have to wait and hopefully see. So  back to tonight and you should try this before the Moon pops up at 21:52 AEDT. If you have binoculars they will help a lot. Scan the sky to your left of the star Rigel or knee of Orion the hunter (see attached Stellarium map). Look for a small fuzzy or hairy blob and voilà. It's actually rather hard especially from suburban Sydney but if you don't try you will miss out. Good luck and well done Terry Lovejoy for finding his fifth comet. Geoff from MAAS.

If so you have seen light splitting into a spectrum. Astronomers have long used the idea of breaking a light source  like a star  into its spectrum to look at the dark lines within the spectrum. These features help identify the type of star  what it is made of and even how fast it is moving away or toward us. The image below was taken last Thursday night using a new small telescope that will shortly be used by Year 11/12 physics and chemistry students. It shows the light from the star Vega (red) and compares it against the library standard for A0V stars (blue). While the two lines are not an exact match we are pretty happy as a first attempt. Can't wait to try it out on a few students now :)

As comets pass through the Solar System they leave behind a dusty trail. Every now and then the Earth hurtles through that dust trail at astounding speed and if we are lucky we see lots of meteors or shooting stars. Over the next few days we will pass through the trail left behind by the comet 109/Swift-Tuttle and there is a great likelihood of meteors appearing from the part of the sky known as Persues. The bad news for us antipodeans is that the action is probably going to be too low in our northern sky. If you are up around 3am look north by north east into the constellation of Perseus and you may be lucky...or not. Our best chance comes in December for the Geminids. Happy viewing. Geoff from MAAS

As we orbit the Sun we collide with the dust and some northern hemisphere locations may experience up to 30 meteors per hour but we will see less. They can appear anywhere in the sky but the majority when tracked back seem to come from the constellation of Aquarius. Good luck and clear sky. Geoff from MAAS
