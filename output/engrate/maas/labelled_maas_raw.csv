Say hello to Studio Pop-ups  where you can get up close and personal with designers and their creative process! Thursday 15 to Sunday 18 August  10am to 5pm Tickets: free with Museum entry   Everybody knows about the Powerhouse Museum’s Young Blood markets which were launched in 2005 as part of Sydney Design. It was one of the first designer markets in Sydney and the only design market which was presented in a vibrant museum setting. Markets are an important launch pad for emerging designers but as a museum dedicated to ‘unpacking’ design in all its manifestations  we now feel its time to crank it up a notch and give you the chance to see inside a designer’s studio.   Studio Pop-ups will continue to support the work of local designers whilst offering you a deeper and more meaningful experience with the design process. Discover how a jeweller makes each piece  learn about contemporary technologies  processes  systems and equipment and find out first hand what motivates and inspires designers or hear about changes in their field.   Studio Pop-ups presents ten carefully selected design studios – as pop ups. Designers are selling their products and also offering you the chance to see how it’s done. Each studio is housed in a specially-designed pop up stall located inside the Museum. Studio Pop-ups is the perfect opportunity to be a part of the design conversation and to learn more about the design process. Where else can you buy your favourite designer’s work  have a go at the creative process yourself and go home with a deeper knowledge and understanding of how it was made?  http://www.sydneydesign.com.au/2013/event/studio-pop-ups-3/,LER,link

We are still getting lots of calls about Mars being as big as the full Moon tomorrow  27 August. Nope! It cannot happen but the hoax that began in 2003 when Mars was close seems come back to us every year. If you get up early tomorrow morning and look East you may see the faint planet Mars in the constellation of Cancer the Crab at around 5:30am AEDT. Rather than being the same size as the Moon it will appear to be just 1/460th as big  ie tiny. As Dr Nick explains in his detailed blog it will be good in 2018 but never as big as the Moon. Enjoy the view if you do decide to get up and check.,HER,photo

On the day I was born the Sun was in the constellation of Leo but according to my "star sign" I am a Virgo! Either way I love looking at the sky and right now (Mon 12 Aug 2013 8:20PM AEST) the Moon is very close to the brightest star in Virgo called Spica. If there are any other wonderful Virgos out there have a look at the best of all the Zodiacs (flame proof suit at the ready). Of course at Sydney Observatory we don't believe in astrology but we do use the stars as a map. Right now the celestial map has the Moon in Virgo. Watch how much is moves before it sets.

Probably no Perseids for us :( We've had a lot of calls about the meteor shower coming from the constellation of Perseus. As you can see in the image made with Stellarium the constellation is on the northern horizon at around 4:30am for us in Sydney. Sadly that is too low. There may be one or two bright meteors or even fireballs but it is very unlikely. On any clear night you can expect to see up to 6 meteors per hour every night but from a bright city they are lost in the light pollution. The Perseid meteor shower is a northern hemisphere event.

Speared emu? Last night from Mitchell Ridge Lookout at around 6:22pm AEST a satellite made an interesting addition to a twilight image.

Tanabata on 7th July each year is my (Geoff of the Obs) favourite star festival. It deals with the stars Altair and the former pole star Vega. Legend in Japan has it that Vega (Orihime) misses her husband Altair (Hikoboshi) who has been marooned on the other side of the Milky Way  the river in the sky  by her father. Once a year magpies build a bridge over the Milky Way so the two can be together for just one day. A sad but lovely story. Both stars are visible now on this cold winter night. Vega is very low in the north and the fifth brightest star in the night sky. Altair is about 40 degrees above the northwest horizon at 11pm. It is the twelfth brightest star in the night sky. From the countryside you should be able to see the Milky Way between them. The woodblock print showing the festival was copied from Wikipedia.,LER,photo

On 23 June 2013  our nearest neighbour  the Moon  will be particularly close. As the Moon orbits the Earth in a slightly elliptical orbit  the closest monthly approach known as perigee will be 356 991km at 21:12 AEST. At nearly the same time  the Moon will be full at 21:32 AEST.   Recently  this potentially pretty combination of a full moon near the same time as perigee has been dubbed the “Supermoon”.  Weather permitting  this seems like a good time not only to enjoy the view but to test an odd idea about the size of the Moon as we see it.  Have you ever noticed that Moon looks so much larger when it rises than when it appears high overhead? The Moon  the Sun and even the constellations suffer from the same magnification near the horizon  or do they?  Here in Sydney  the full moon rises at 16:50 AEST at a compass bearing of 101 degrees  or about 114 degrees East of true North. This is 4 hours and 42 minutes before it is full and 4 hours and 22 minutes before its closest approach.  There is no doubt it will be the biggest full moon of the year but is it really bigger when it is close to the horizon than when it is high overhead?  So here is your challenge. Find a stiff piece of clear plastic (or cardboard if that’s all you can find) and have a marker pen ready. You will also need a clear view to the East to see the Moon rise. Just as the Moon clears the horizon  hold the piece of plastic at arm's length and mark off the Moon’s apparent diameter. Enjoy the view before retreating back inside where it’s warm and perhaps read one of our other blog posts. Go back outside 3 to 6 hours later  if you can stay up that late  and repeat the measurements. Make sure you record which set of marks was taken at what time  and include the date.  Now measure with a ruler the two sets of marks and compare.  Did the Moon actually get smaller as it rose  or did it get bigger or stay the same within the limitations of our simple exercise?  On 24 June we will post a call for your answers on our Facebook page - just reply with your answer  'SMALLER'  'BIGGER' or 'SAME'.  Most importantly  don’t throw out the piece of plastic as we will use it again for the 'Minimoon' on 16 January 2014 when the full moon occurs near apogee at about 403 532km away.  Good luck.

Sadly not comets! At this time of year we get a few calls about odd comet-like objects very early of a morning or just after sunset. In most cases what people are seeing are high altitude jets leaving behind a vapour trail or contrail. They are in effect just clouds.

In response to questions on how to view the upcoming eclipse without solar glasses the following was copied from an earlier post by Dr Nick Lomb  curator of astronomy at Sydney Observatory.  Do not look at the Sun either directly or through a telescope or binoculars. To do so risks serious eye damage or blindness.  However it is possible to safely watch the eclipse if you have a small telescope or a pair of binoculars – but to look at a projection of the Sun instead of looking through the instrument at the Sun.   Use the telescope (for safety  remove the finderscope first) or the binoculars to project the image  as shown in the diagram. With your back to the Sun  aim the telescope towards it (this is not as difficult to do as it sounds – use the shadow of the telescope) and focus its image onto a white card held about 20 cm behind the eyepiece.   DO NOT LOOK THROUGH THE TELESCOPE OR ITS LITTLE FINDERSCOPE! Never leave the telescope unattended and ensure that children are supervised at all times. Viewing the projected image is quite safe  but looking through the telescope or binoculars will cause almost instant blindness!,LER,photo

The Moon will only be a very thin crescent whereas Venus will be a very bright point of light. They will both then set together in the west at around 10:30pm. You will also notice that Venus is very bright. Venus is at maximum brightness tonight. There are two main factors affecting the brightness of Venus - one is how close Venus is to the Earth and the other is the relative position of Venus to the Sun as viewed from Earth. The combination of these two factors has resulted in the brightness of Venus increasing over the past few weeks to a maximum brightness tonight  after tonight it will slowly start to fade back to usual levels.,HER,photo

Astronomers have found a young free-floating planet that is not orbiting a star. It is a very low mass object  around 6 times that of Jupiter  too low to be a star. http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/10/131009153455.htm,HER,link
Hello there  Geoff of the Obs here on his twofold odyssey to the northern hemisphere. To see the aurora borealis from Lapland and comet ISON from the USA. So far so good. On the flight from Singapore to Helsinki I woke and looked out towards Ursa Major  the Big Bear  Big Dipper or Wagon as some call it. The sky was amazingly clear at 12000m as you would expect. Just below and to the west was a faint but observable aurora. The technical term was “Yippee!”. So  by holding the camera hard against the window then shrouding it by using my jacket I was able to get a few shots of around 4 seconds before movement became too much on an issue. This shot was taken while above Russia. Some towns can be seen below the thin cloud cover.  While the camera was taking the dark frame after this image a very bright meteor shot through the field of view  D’oh about 4 seconds too late. No colour was visible to the eye but the camera (Canon 6D at ISO 6400) caught the beautiful pinks and later some greens. The curtain nature was clearly visible and I kept shooting until the battery was flat ☹. In another hour I will arrive in Helsinki then an overnight train to Rovaniemi for some more aurora  hopefully. All I need is for the Sun to continue to shoot charged particles at us at around 400km/s and some clear sky. Let me know if you want o see more of my astro-journey over the next two months.

Get your camera ready! Tonight (27 Sep 2013) the International Space Station (ISS) will pass between Venus and Saturn around 7:35pm AEST.  Look west for the bright planet Venus and just wait for the starlike object moving left to right. Sadly not everyone will be able to see the same show. Further north than Grafton or so the ISS will go above Venus but from there south to Melbounre it will pass between the two planets. Thanks to Les D for pointing this out.

The spring equinox is tomorrow  Monday 23rd at 6.44am. By the way it will continue to be on 23rd until the year 2020. Equinox’ means ‘equal night’ but it’s not really equal. Daylight starts when the very first limb of the Sun is seen coming up over horizon and it continues until the very last limb disappears in the west. So there’s always going to be just a bit more day than night.,HER,photo

Well here is an image taken during a tour tonight Wed 18 Sep 2013. Rather spectacular to the naked eye but by the time I called the other guide and had a look it had faded. We watched this for around 5 minutes move only a few degrees and fade as it dispersed. My colleague was able to look at it with our biggest telescope and said he could see a star-like object next to the cloud. Either a launch as some have suggested or a release of gas from a satellite  which has been done before in order to study the atmosphere. Either way it was another great night viewing at Sydney Observatory. The image is blurred as it was hand held but I've circled the fading diffuse object. Cheers. Geoff of the Obs,HER,photo

Don’t you love it when things just seem to line up? Astronomers tend to get very excited when this happens as it can be a great opportunity to observe something unusual  useful and often quite simply beautiful. Solar and lunar eclipse are the most well know examples of a syzygy  three celestial bodies in a line but there are other types too. Tomorrow  Monday 4 August the Moon will be directly between us and the jewel of the night sky – Saturn. This is known as an occultation and they can be surprisingly common with 11 visible somewhere around the Earth this year. For Sydney-siders it will be the third this year though the first in Feb was during the day. The last was on May 14 and the next one after Aug won’t be until ANZAC day 2019.   So what will you see? Look to the West from around 8:45pm and locate the Moon in the constellation of Libra. About ½ a degree above  or half the width of your outstretched pinkie at arm’s length  look for a slightly yellow star-like object  Saturn. Over the next half hour the Moon will sink lower into the west but more slowly than Saturn and the gap between the two will close. At 9:22pm AEST the rings will kiss the dark limb of the Moon and then the planet will vanish for just under an hour. This first part  the disappearance  will be easy to see as Saturn won’t be overpowered by the bright part of the Moon.   At 10:13pm Saturn will reappear near Mare Australe (Southern Sea) when the Moon is just 30 degrees above the western horizon. At first Saturn will be hard to see in the glare of the Moon but well worth a try especially if you have a pair of binoculars or a small telescope.   We hope to broadcast the event live from the North dome telescope via our webpage  weather permitting  so please follow the link on our main page at www.sydneyobservatory.com.au  from 8:45pm onwards.,HER,photo

IF the weather had been clear this morning you may have noticed the very bright planet Venus in the constellation of Aries the Ram.

Seven days from today the Moon will glide between us and the Sun! If anyone has connections to make a trip to Antarctica for an annular eclipse it would be an awesome sight (can I come too?).   For us in Sydney the Moon will cover 52% of the Sun’ diameter at 5:15pm.   Weather permitting we hope to broadcast this live through a new and very powerful solar telescope. If you don’t have the correct eclipse glasses or filters PLEASE DO NOT TRY TO MAKE YOUR OWN ! (Yes we are shouting as it is so important to be careful).  The eclipse will start at 4:14pm AEST and the maximum will be at 5:15pm just two minutes before the Sun sets.   We have no doubt that some will try to take a “safe” unfiltered peek at the Sun when it sits low on the horizon but this MUST NOT be done. Permanent irreversible eye damage can be the dreadful result!   Please share this with as many people as you can. It is a beautiful event if viewed safely. More details to come :),HER,photo
We've had a few requests about the Lyrid meteor shower that may peak today (22 Apr) at around 4pm AEST. Sadly for us in the South this is not a good chance to see meteors  but there are no guarantees either way. If anyone is keen to try you will need a perfectly clear view to the North with little to no light pollution over the next few nights. Look for the bright star Vega as shown in the map. It rises at around midnight but the part of the sky you need to see is BELOW that  so you need to wait until around 3am. Even at this time the radiant (apparent point source of the meteors) will be below the horizon. If the conditions are good you may see a meteor or two or...  Don't forget we can see around 6 per hour on any night. The best time is always a few hours before sunrise and look eastward. Good luck. BTW check spaceweather for the latest images.,HER,photo
One of the prettiest objects in the sky is perfectly placed now for those with a pair of binoculars or a small telescope. Start by finding the Southern Cross and its nearby pointers in Centaurus. From the pointer closer to the cross head towards the star Epsilon Centauri as shown on the map and then continue in the same direction and about the same distance to search for a small fuzzy blob. That's it! NGC 5139 or Omega Centarui. We now believe it is the core of a small galaxy that was ripped apart by our galaxy the Milky Way. There are perhaps one million stars and they are about 16 000 light years away. This image is a single 74 second image through a cheapish f5 200mm Skywatcher telescope on an EQ6 Pro mount.

Tomorrow  22 Feb 2014 there will be an interesting though very difficult to see astronomical event that is still worth a try. The Moon will block or occult the planet Saturn. You would need a tripod mounted pair of binoculars or telescope to stand any chance and the weather will need to be perfect. Look westward around 10am  for those of us in Sydney  and scan the upper right edge of the Moon for the small and very faint Saturn. PLEASE NOTE IT WILL BE VERY HARD TO SEE. It will vanish for about an hour but seeing it re-appear will be more difficult as the Moon will have sunk further into the west.

With lots of rain there is always the good chance of a rainbow. Unlike the ice crystal halos from last week this one was a typical rainbow caused by water droplets in the air. This one from western Sydney is a very nice double. Look carefully at the second bow to see the colours are reversed from the primary. Canon 5D Samyang 14mm ISO 200 1/320s.,HER,photo
Mystery of the second halo solved thanks to Linda Gee. The beautiful 22 degree halo earlier today was supplemented by a second halo that had the Sun on its circumference. Known as a Parhelic circle they are apparently quite rare. More details can be found here  http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/parcirc.htm and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parhelic_circle.

13 Feb 2014 ~12:53pm. This photo has had the contrast adjusted to make the rainbow or halos easier to see. These halos are caused by flat hexagonal ice crystals in cirrus clouds high up in the atmosphere. The Sun's light is bent or refracted through the ice to make the rainbows. Cool huh?,HER,photo

This weekend (Sat 15 Feb) the planet Venus will be at its greatest brilliancy for 2014. Look East and hour or two before Sunrise (6:30am AEDT) and it should be rather obvious just below the teapot of Sagittarius. At magnitude -4.6 it is about 25 times brighter than Sirius the dog star  brightest of the night time stars. A small telescope or good binoculars will show its crescent shape of about 25%. This is also a good chance to try some simple astro- night-scape photography. You don't need a huge telephoto lens as it's all about composition. Make sure your camera  preferably an SLR is mounted on a solid tripod. Open the lens aperture as wide as possible  ie small number like f2. Increase the ISO but not too much and you will need to see what is best for your camera and location. Use mirror lock if possible and a cable release to minimise vibrations. Try several different exposures and most importantly check the focus. It should be set to infinity (looks like an '8' on its side) but not all lenses are focused to infinity when the symbols say so. Take some test exposures and blow them up to check. Lastly make sure you share your results with us :),HER,photo

We all know the Moon orbits the Earth roughly once a 'moonth' but it is often hard to get a feel for hour much it moves day to day. If the weather co-operates tonight (10/2/2014) and tomorrow you can use the planet Jupiter as a marker. Tonight the Moon will be in Orion above and to the left of Jupiter. Tomorrow night it will be in Gemini above and to the right.,HER,photo
It's a beautiful night outside right now (9 Feb) and the gibbous Moon is well worth a look if you have some small binoculars or a telescope. Many people think it is best seen at the time of being full but there aren't any shadows like now. Try to spot the crater Copernicus about half way along the terminator (shadow line). The crater is about 90km across. 200mm f5 Skywatcher telescope  Canon 6D  1/100sec and 100ISO by Geoff of the Obs. Enjoy :),HER,photo
From Castle Hill the view of the Moon setting over the Blue Mountains was rather pretty! The first image was 1.6seconds  800ISO  500mm Pentax telescope and Canon 550D. The second image was just before it had set completely and was 2.5seconds long. Geoff of the Obs,HER,photo
Just how hard is it to find comet Q2 Lovejoy? Quite hard in fact. The first image was taken Tue 30 Dec 2014 at 11:15pm with a 50mm Canon lens and 6D camera  20seconds at 800ISO. The second image is the same but the tiny green dot at the top has been highlighted to make it easier to find. Small isn't it! The third image was taken last night with a 500mm lens. You can also see how far the comet has moved in 24 hours by locating the small globular cluster near Sirius known as M79. Good hunting to you all :) Geoff,HER,photo
Comet Lovejoy Q2 as imaged from last night (20 Dec). 1 minute exposure with a Canon 6D ISO 6400 Pentax 75SDHF refractor on an unguided Skywatcher EQ6 mount.

A FAINT Christmas comet is on the way! BUT  and yes it's a big BUT  it will be very hard to see until around 7 Jan and will at that point probably fade quite quickly. Comets can be extremely frustrating as I demonstrated last year by travelling to the northern hemisphere to see Comet ISON which imho was a total dud! This comet is the fifth found by Terry Lovejoy from Australia. It's called Comet Lovejoy C/2014 Q2. The map below has been produced by the the magazine Sky & Telescope. You will not be able to see it yet with the naked eye unless you have perfect vision and no light pollution but it should be faintly visible in binoculars. It looks like a another country side visit  weather permitting  for some photos this weekend :) We will keep you posted and here's hoping it gets brighter. Geoff from MAAS.,HER,photo
Here is a close up of one of the Geminids seen last night from near Bathurst at 1:15am. There is still a chance to see some tonight from 11pm onwards low in the north but you would need to be away from bright city lights. Good luck...again :),HER,photo

The meteors are coming!  Do you remember the story of Hansel and Gretel and the part where they left a trail? Well it’s a bit of a stretch but I think the asteroid 3200 Phaethon is an astronomical analogue of sorts. Over the next few days the Earth will move into the dust trail left behind by the asteroid and that signals the start of the of the annual Geminid meteor shower. Dust trails are usually a trait of comets but it has been suggested that as the asteroid travels close to the Sun it warms  cracks and ejects dust which must be bad for the asteroid but good for us watching from afar. Tiny pieces of dust hit Earth's atmosphere travelling at up to 32 km/s and disintegrate completely 73 km above Earth's surface. They appear as short sharp streaks of light coming from the region of the sky around the constellation of Gemini the twins  hence the name- Geminids. Expected to peak in the early mornings of December 13-14 observers in dark locations away from city lights in the northern hemisphere might see as many as 120 meteors per hour. So what will we see? Not as many but it is still the best chance for us all year. By the way  some think they may peak earlier so if you are up late or early (~1am onwards) look northward towards Gemini and good luck.

For just one hour from 9:25pm to 10:25pm AEDT 8/10/2014  all the sunsets and all the sunrises around the world will cast a deep 'reddish' hue on the eclipsed Moon. The colour as shown in the picture here is NOT what the eye will see as this was a few seconds exposure on a DSLR. No-one can predict if the colour will be red or coppery brown. As long as the weather holds it will be a great show. The lead up will start at 8:15pm in the north east as the Moon enters the Earth's shadow.

We are excited and delighted to have launched our brand new East Dome this morning at Sydney Observatory!  This visionary new structure includes a lift right up into the dome and to the new telescope  providing full accessibility to those with limited mobility. The Museum has also purchased a very special telescope  with an articulated eyepiece able to easily adjust to different heights for easy viewing of the night sky for people in wheelchairs. (This telescope is one of several in the world and the only one in the Southern Hemisphere!)  Another exciting aspect of the project is that the new building will house an exhibition  developed by MAAS  titled ‘Accessing the Sky’ which will highlight Sydney Observatory’s participation in the 1887 Carte du Ciel (Chart of the Sky) and Astrographic Catalogue projects to photograph and chart the entire celestial globe.

‘Mozziemoonageddon’ is here and the Moon is to blame  partly. It’s Supermoon Wednesday today  21 Jan 2015! What does that mean? Not much really unless you’re a mosquito but we want to share to avoid some confusion. The term ‘Supermoon’ is relatively new as astronomers prefer ‘perigee moon’ ie when the full or new moon is closest in its monthly orbit of Earth. The word perigee is from French and earlier Greek peri meaning close and gea from Gaia meaning Earth  hence close to Earth. Today’s Supermoon however is new moon so we don’t see a thing except perhaps the effect of the tides  big tides at that. In Sydney Harbour today at 9:35am AEDT the high tide was 2m! Apparently such spring or king tides can lead to salt water flowing into marshy areas and creating perfect conditions for mosquitoes to breed  darn. You won’t be able to see the Moon however tonight or tomorrow as it’s too close to the Sun however Friday night  weather and mozzies permitting  there should be a nice crescent moon setting in the West around 21:52.,HER,photo

Do you have a VERY clear view to the West? If so  just after sunset tonight you may be able to see the planets Venus and Mercury close together very low in the western sky. Mercury has already past its closest approach to Venus so today is possibly the best chance weather wise. The young crescent Moon will also swing by Venus on the 22nd just after sunset. The photo below was taken from the Nile Valley a few days ago by one of wonderful team Brenan :) BTW look how his position (Egypt) has changed the orientation of the planets to how we see them from Sydney as shown in the Stellarium iamge.,HER,photo
Comets and weather can be frustrating at times. This image was taken from near Bathurst  the limit of an after work drive  late on Thu 8 Jan 2015. Sadly by the time I got there the Moon and clouds were making viewing difficult. The comet was fairly easy to see but not as bright as expected considering how bright it was a week ago. This heavily processed image shows some tail detail. Geoff from MAAS. Canon 6D ISO 6400 20sec. 500mm Pentax SDHF telescope.,HER,photo
Hopefully everyone is getting ready to go comet hunting tonight BEFORE the Moon pops up in the East at 21:52 AEDT. If you are still up around 23:00 or so look to the East and you'll see the Moon just 5 degrees away from Jupiter. Both objects will be in the constellation of Leo.,HER,photo
Tonight's the night...sort of! If today remains clear and it's looking good now  tonight is probably the best chance for us in the south to see comet Lovejoy high in our night sky. About now it is as close to Earth as it will be for the next 8000 years at ~70 million km away. Over the next few weeks it moves closer to the Sun and brightens but further from us :( From our point of view it will also head towards the northern sky making it harder to see. Our friends in the north may be in a for a great view but comets are notoriously difficult to predict so we will have to wait and hopefully see. So  back to tonight and you should try this before the Moon pops up at 21:52 AEDT. If you have binoculars they will help a lot. Scan the sky to your left of the star Rigel or knee of Orion the hunter (see attached Stellarium map). Look for a small fuzzy or hairy blob and voilà. It's actually rather hard especially from suburban Sydney but if you don't try you will miss out. Good luck and well done Terry Lovejoy for finding his fifth comet. Geoff from MAAS.,HER,photo
Every year since 2003 (the last favourable opposition of Mars) we have been asked about a fake email that states the planet Mars will be as big as the Moon on 27 August. This year however there was an added twist that there would be TWO Moons. The answer to both is no. Mars is presently 485 times smaller than the Moon as we see it and we have no idea where the two Moon idea came from? So  tomorrow  27 Aug should be a normal day of 86400 seconds duration as we hurtle around the Sun at a comfortable 30km/s. Geoff from MAAS,HER,photo

The Moon and the last hint of sunlight in the windows of a nearby building as seen from Fort Phillip at Sydney Observatory. BTW the Moon isn't blue but it is...! Tonight at 8:43pm AEST the Moon will be full for the second time this month. Due to a misinterpretation by the staff of the magazine 'Sky & Telescope' in 1946 the term "Blue Moon" came to mean the second full Moon in a month. It had previously been the third of four in a season. Whichever definition you use  it is rather cute. Geoff from MAAS,HER,photo

Tomorrow (14 July 2015) night is the last time we can say we are going to see a Solar System 'planet' up close for the first time! Yes we all know it's no longer a planet as it was excluded by vote just 7 months after New Horizons was launched in January 2006 but it's still very exciting to finally see Pluto and Charon in detail. So  what should you do? Look towards the north-east around 10pm into the constellation of Sagitarrius. You won't actually see a thing as Pluto is so small (about 2300 km diameter) and so far away (about 6 billion km) but at least you'll be looking in the right direction.

Over the last few days a large sunspot group has been rotating into view. AR2529 is at least twice as big as the Earth. The first image was taken shortly after sunrise today with a small refractor. The second image is from our main solar telescope and shows what what we can see on our daily tours to the North dome. Both red images were made from a b&w video of 499 frames aligned  stacked  sharpened and given false colour in Photoshop. Geoff from MAAS,HER,photo

Dr Rajan Chhetri is a guide at Sydney Observatory. He researches Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) and below discusses the interesting phenomenon that blacks holes might twinkle. We've all sung or heard the nursery rhyme "twinkle twinkle little star". Celestial objects of a certain small size twinkle (for example stars twinkle  but the Moon does not). Twinkling of the stars is caused when light from distant stars arrives to us through different paths when traveling through Earth's atmosphere  due to the atmospheric turbulence.

Over the next few weeks there will be four planets visible in the pre-dawn sky that are easy to see and one that's a bit tough. At around 5am look North for the bright planet Jupiter then down to your right for slightly reddish Mars  down again to the right for the slightly yellow beige Saturn and then very bright Venus. Mercury is going to be hard to see but the best chance is the first few days  of February. Good luck. Geoff from MAAS,HER,photo
Is there a planet orbiting Proxima Centauri  our closest night time star? In 1915 Robert Innes discovered that Proxima Centauri was our closest star not far from bright Alpha Centauri. Last year I wrote about the centenary of this discovery  its Australian connection and how to see Proxima Centauri for yourself. Now the European Southern Observatory (ESO) is searching for planets orbiting the star. [  120 more words. ]   http://from.ph/74c,LER,link
