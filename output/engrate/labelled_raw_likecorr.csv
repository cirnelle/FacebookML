Document of the Week  National Advisory Committee For Aeronautics (NACA) Resolution on the Subject of Space  Adopted January 16  1958.   Following the launch of first two Soviet Sputniks (in October and November 1957) the NACA created the Special Committee on Space Technology.  This committee was led by H. Guyford Stever  then associate dean of engineering at MIT.   The Special Committee's first written product was "A National Research Program for Space Technology " a staff study completed on January 14  1958.  The study characterized "the Soviet.....bid for world supremacy" as "a most serious challenge to the United States and the Western world " and called for "an energetic program for research and development for the conquest of space." The study also recommended that such a program follow "the pattern .... already developed by the NACA and the military services" and exemplified in the X-15 program  where "the scientific research [would] be the responsibility of a national civilian agency working in close cooperation with the applied research and development groups required for weapon-systems development by the military." This study was adopted by the NACA Executive Committee two days later  reappearing in a "Resolution on the Subject of Space Flight." The text of that resolution is shown in the 4 images below.

Document of the Week:  National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) Committee on Aerodynamics Meeting Minutes (excerpt)  Date: October 30  1947  Two weeks after Captain Charles Yeager had flown through Mach 1  breaking the “sound barrier”  the NACA committee responsible for high-speed flight research met. The NACA was interested in systematic research on high speed flight - not on setting arbitrary speed records. The Aerodynamics Committee was concerned that Army and Navy pilots on loan to the NACA for flight research programs might ignore the research program in the interest of setting new speed records. The Committee was concerned enough about this to send a message to the test pilots., LER, photo

ESA/Hubble Flashback: Star on a Hubble diet. Tag & share!  The star cluster Pismis 24 lies in the core of the large emission nebula NGC 6357 that extends one degree on the sky in the direction of the Scorpius constellation. Part of the nebula is ionised by the youngest (bluest) heavy stars in Pismis 24. The intense ultraviolet radiation from the blazing stars heats the gas surrounding the cluster and creates a bubble in NGC 6357. The presence of these surrounding gas clouds makes probing into the region even harder.

ESA/Hubble Flashback: Hubble snaps images of a nebula within a cluster. Tag & share!  The unique planetary nebula NGC 2818 is nested inside the open star cluster NGC 2818A. Both the cluster and the nebula reside over 10 000 light-years away  in the southern constellation Pyxis (the Compass).  NGC 2818 is one of very few planetary nebulae in our galaxy located within an open cluster. Open clusters  in general  are loosely bound and they disperse over hundreds of millions of years. Stars that form planetary nebulae typically live for billions of years. Hence  it is rare that an open cluster survives long enough for one of its members to form a planetary nebula. This open cluster is particularly ancient  estimated to be nearly one billion years old.  Read more at: http://spacetelescope.org/images/ann0901a/  Credit:, HER, photo

This Hubble Space Telescope view of the core of one of the nearest globular star clusters  called NGC 6397  resembles a treasure chest of glittering jewels. The cluster is located 8 200 light-years away in the constellation Ara.  Here  the stars are jam-packed together. The stellar density is about a million times greater than in our Sun's stellar neighborhood. The stars are only a few light-weeks apart  while the nearest star to our Sun is over four light-years away.

ESA/Hubble Flashback: Hubble scores a perfect ten. Tag & share!  The NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope is back in business. Just a couple of days after the orbiting observatory was brought back online  Hubble aimed its prime working camera  the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2)  at a particularly intriguing target  a pair of gravitationally interacting galaxies called Arp 147.  The two galaxies happen to be oriented so that they appear to mark the number 10. The left-most galaxy  or the "one" in this image  is relatively undisturbed  apart from a smooth ring of starlight. It appears nearly edge-on to our line of sight. The right-most galaxy  the "zero" of the pair  exhibits a clumpy  blue ring of intense star formation.

An image not from doomsday but an ESA/Hubble Flashback showing an artist's impression of a stellar flare hitting an exoplanet  This artist’s impression shows exoplanet HD 189733b  as it passes in front of its parent star  called HD 189733A. Hubble’s instruments observed the system in 2010  and in 2011 following a large flare from the star (depicted in the image). Following the flare  Hubble observed the planet’s atmosphere evaporating at a rate of over 1000 tonnes per second.  In this picture  the surface of the star  which is around 80% the mass of the Sun  is based on observations of the Sun from the Solar Dynamics Observatory.

The NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope has snapped a photograph of a strange object that bears an uncanny resemblance to a hamburger.  The object  nicknamed Gomez's Hamburger  is a sun-like star nearing the end of its life. It already has expelled large amounts of gas and dust and is on its way to becoming a colorful  glowing planetary nebula. The ingredients for the giant celestial hamburger are dust and light. The hamburger buns are light reflecting off dust and the patty is the dark band of dust in the middle.

ESA/Hubble Flashback: Fireworks of Star Formation Light Up a Galaxy. Tag & share!  Newly released images obtained with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope in July 1997 reveal episodes of star formation that are occurring across the face of the nearby galaxy NGC 4214. Located some 13 million light-years from Earth  NGC 4214 is currently forming clusters of new stars from its interstellar gas and dust. In the Hubble image  we can see a sequence of steps in the formation and evolution of stars and star clusters. The picture was created from exposures taken in several colour filters with Hubble's Wide Field Planetary Camera 2.

ESA/Hubble Flashback: Nebula NGC 2080  nicknamed the 'Ghost Head Nebula' Tag & share!   The 'Ghost Head Nebula' is one of a chain of star-forming regions lying south of the 30 Doradus nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Two bright regions (the 'eyes of the ghost')  named A1 (left) and A2 (right)  are very hot  glowing 'blobs' of hydrogen and oxygen. The bubble in A1 is produced by the hot  intense radiation and powerful stellar wind from a single massive star. A2 has a more complex appearance due to the presence of more dust  and it contains several hidden  massive stars. The massive stars in A1 and A2 must have formed within the last 10 000 years since their natal gas shrouds are not yet disrupted by the powerful radiation of the newly born stars.

ESA/Hubble Flashback: The Hourglass Nebula. Tag & share!  This is an image of MyCn18  a young planetary nebula located about 8 000 light-years away  taken with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).  This Hubble image reveals the true shape of MyCn18 to be an hourglass with an intricate pattern of 'etchings' in its walls. This picture has been composed from three separate images taken in the light of ionized nitrogen (represented by red)  hydrogen (green)  and doubly-ionized oxygen (blue).  The results are of great interest because they shed new light on the poorly understood ejection of stellar matter which accompanies the slow death of Sun-like stars. In previous ground-based images  MyCn18 appears to be a pair of large outer rings with a smaller central one  but the fine details cannot be seen.

ESA/Hubble Flashback: Hubble Finds Mature Galaxy Masquerading as Toddler. Tag & share!  The NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope quashed the possibility that what was previously believed to be a toddler galaxy in the nearby universe may actually be considered an adult. Called I Zwicky 18  this galaxy has a youthful appearance that resembles galaxies typically found only in the early universe. Hubble has now found faint  older stars within this galaxy  suggesting that the galaxy may have formed at the same time as most other galaxies.  I Zwicky 18 is classified as a dwarf irregular galaxy and is much smaller than our Milky Way Galaxy. The concentrated bluish-white knots embedded in the heart of the galaxy are two major starburst regions where stars are forming at a furious rate. The wispy blue filaments surrounding the central starburst regions are bubbles of gas that have been blown away by stellar winds and supernovae explosions from a previous generation of hot  young stars. This gas is now heated by intense ultraviolet radiation unleashed by hot  young stars.  Read more at: http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/heic0716a/  Credit: NASA  ESA  and A.

ESA/Hubble Flashback: Hubble Captures a “Lucky” Galaxy Alignment. Tag & share!  An interesting galaxy has been circled in this NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image. The galaxy — one of a group of galaxies called Luminous Red Galaxies — has an unusually large mass  containing about ten times the mass of the Milky Way. However  it’s actually the blue horseshoe shape that circumscribes the red galaxy that is the real prize in this image.  This blue horseshoe is a distant galaxy that has been magnified and warped into a nearly complete ring by the strong gravitational pull of the massive foreground Luminous Red Galaxy. To see such a so-called Einstein Ring required the fortunate alignment of the foreground and background galaxies  making this object’s nickname “the Cosmic Horseshoe” particularly apt.

ESA/Hubble Flashback: Flocculent spiral NGC 2841. Tag & share!  Star formation is one of the most important processes in shaping the Universe; it plays a pivotal role in the evolution of galaxies and it is also in the earliest stages of star formation that planetary systems first appear.  Yet there is still much that astronomers don’t understand  such as how do the properties of stellar nurseries vary according to the composition and density of gas present  and what triggers star formation in the first place? The driving force behind star formation is particularly unclear for a type of galaxy called a flocculent spiral  such as NGC 2841 shown here  which features short spiral arms rather than prominent and well-defined galactic limbs.

ESA/Hubble Flashback: Nearby Dust Clouds in the Milky Way. Tag & share!  The yearly ritual of spring cleaning clears a house of dust as well as dust "bunnies"  those pesky dust balls that frolic under beds and behind furniture. NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope has photographed similar dense knots of dust and gas in our Milky Way Galaxy. This cosmic dust  however  is not a nuisance. It is a concentration of elements that are responsible for the formation of stars in our galaxy and throughout the universe.  These opaque  dark knots of gas and dust are called Bok globules  and they are absorbing light in the center of the nearby emission nebula and star-forming region  NGC 281. The globules are named after astronomer Bart Bok  who proposed their existence in the 1940's.

Inside at least some of the EGGs stars being formed.  Undersea coral? Enchanted castles? Space serpents? These eerie  dark pillar-like structures are actually columns of cool interstellar hydrogen gas and dust that are also incubators for new stars.

The Hubble telescope captured a display of starlight  glowing gas  and silhouetted dark clouds of interstellar dust in this 4-foot-by-8-foot image of the barred spiral galaxy NGC 1300. NGC 1300 is considered to be prototypical of barred spiral galaxies. Barred spirals differ from normal spiral galaxies in that the arms of the galaxy do not spiral all the way into the center  but are connected to the two ends of a straight bar of stars containing the nucleus at its center.

ESA/Hubble Flashback: Young stars sculpt gas with powerful outflows. Tag & Share!  This Hubble Space Telescope view shows one of the most dynamic and intricately detailed star-forming regions in space  located 210 000 light-years away in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC)  a satellite galaxy of our Milky Way. At the centre of the region is a brilliant star cluster called NGC 346. A dramatic structure of arched  ragged filaments with a distinct ridge surrounds the cluster.  A torrent of radiation from the hot stars in the cluster NGC 346  at the centre of this Hubble image  eats into denser areas around it  creating a fantasy sculpture of dust and gas. The dark  intricately beaded edge of the ridge  seen in silhouette  is particularly dramatic. It contains several small dust globules that point back towards the central cluster  like windsocks caught in a gale.

Let's Ride!  Cowboy Joe (NACA High-Speed Flight Station test pilot Joseph Walker) and his steed (Bell Aircraft Corporation X-1A) A happy Joe was photographed in 1955 at Edwards  California. The X-1A was flown six times by Bell Aircraft Company pilot Jean "Skip" Ziegler in 1953. Air Force test pilots Maj. Charles "Chuck" Yeager and Maj. Arthur "Kit" Murray made 18 flights between 21 November 1953 and 26 August 1954. The X-1A was then turned over to the NACA. Joe Walker piloted the first NACA flight on 20 July 1955. Walker attemped a second flight on 8 August 1955  but an explosion damaged the aircraft just before launch. Walker  unhurt  climbeed back into the JTB-29A mothership  and the X-1A was jettisoned over the Edwards AFB bombing range.  See: http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=E-1758, LER, photo

The NASA-improved X-ray fluorescence (XRF) scanners have been particularly well received in museums  where they are used to authenticate artifacts and works of art and assist those who conserve them. The scanner’s ability to detect the elemental composition of an object with a simple  nondestructive scan makes it ideal for analyzing precious  rare  or delicate items. Kaiser estimates that more than 600 museums and universities worldwide now use the device  including such institutions as the National Archives  the Field Museum of Natural History  the Louvre  the National Gallery  and the British Museum.   One reason the device is so popular is that experts in art history or archeology can easily be taught how to use it. “It doesn’t take a chemist to operate it ” says Bruce Kaiser  a scientist and pioneer in XRF technology  “I can teach anyone how to point the scanner  look at the color pattern  and figure out what they’ve got.”   As a practical example of the technology’s impact  Kaiser cites art authentication: “I can make something look yellow  but there are a hundred different ways to make something look yellow. Van Gogh only used one. If a museum is eyeing a newly discovered painting  it might be beautiful  it might have the right style and details  but if the elements in the pigments don’t match what Van Gogh used  then you know it’s not his. And yet the museum was about to spend $2 million on it.”   Read more: http://go.usa.gov/jxad And even more: http://go.usa.gov/jxaF, LER, photo

Slow and steady!  The crawlers are unique in the world  having been built in 1965 to move the massive Saturn V rocket from Kennedy’s Vehicle Assembly Building to Launch Complex 39. After the moon landing and Skylab programs ended  the crawlers continued their work  taking space shuttles to their launch pads for 30 years.  With the shuttle fleet retired in 2011  the crawlers are envisioned as critical elements of future launch operations at Kennedy. One is expected to take commercially operated rockets and spacecraft to the launch pad. The other is being strengthened to handle the Space Launch System (SLS)  a rocket and launch tower combination heavier than even the Saturn V moon rockets the crawlers were designed for. - From: http://go.usa.gov/bJ9V Read more: http://go.usa.gov/bJ95 and search more: http://go.usa.gov/bJXz, LER, photo

Early Years at Marshall  Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) offers a great example of how the development of a NASA center created mini melting pots of cultures  from around the country and world   united in pursuing engineering and scientific challenges.     “Graduates of southern universities predominated among new employees in Huntsville  but people came from around the nation. Art Sanderson  who made recruiting trips as part of his responsibilities in the personnel office  recalled that ‘They wanted top-notch engineers and we had a charter to go all over this country to get them.’ [William] Snoddy  a die-hard Crimson Tide fan  said that the diverse origins of his fellow workers became most noticeable during football season. ‘It was really strange to be in Alabama and yet work around people that didn’t care ’ he laughed. ‘They had these weird teams they were cheering for. Some of them were even Yankee teams [from] places I’d never heard of like North Dakota.’” (NASA SP-4313 pp.17-18)  Read more about it at http://go.usa.gov/bwWA and search what Marshall is doing these days at http://go.usa.gov/bwZY., LER, photo

Streaming is now LIVE!! For Project Morpheus free flight.  Ignition still targeted for 3pm. , LER, link
Looks like Project Morpheus continues on track for ignition at 3 p.m. EDT.   Streaming goes live 20 minutes before #FreeFlight  and can be watched at: http://1.usa.gov/1m8LI8y  Project Morpheus integrates NASA's automated landing and hazard avoidance technology with an engine that runs on liquid oxygen and methane  or "green" propellants  into a fully operational lander that could deliver cargo to asteroids and other planetary surfaces. Morpheus and ALHAT are examples of the partnerships that exist within the agency since seven of the 10 NASA centers have contributed time  energy and resources to both.    During today's 98-second test  Morpheus will ascend from the ground over the flame trench to a maximum altitude of more than 800 feet at a peak speed of 36 mph. Morpheus then will fly forward and downward covering approximately 1 300 feet while performing a 78-foot divert to simulate a hazard avoidance maneuver. The test is being performed with ALHAT operating in an open-loop mode  scanning the hazard field and identifying safe landing sites during flight  but not yet navigating the autonomous Morpheus vehicle.  , LER, link
The post-launch press conference will begin at about 5 p.m. Watch at www.nasa.gov/ntv , LER, link

HMI (Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager) is one of the three instrument I am carrying. The HMI scientists have put together a Facebook site  HMI Science Nuggets  and a website describing more of their findings.  The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager extends the capabilities of the SOHO/MDI instrument with continual full-disk coverage at higher spatial resolution and new vector magnetogram capabilities. In other words  HMI provides us with about one terabyte of data a day. giving us insights into sunspots and their magnetic fields.  Read up about the biggest sunspots in Solar Cycle 24., LER, photo

#Cosmochat  Question: How long did it take to plan and design NASA SDO?  I remember the very early days and it sure take a lot of time to put a space mission together.   Pre-Phase A- 1997 - After the launch of the Solar & Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) in 1995  solar scientists began thinking about what data they were still lacking that was necessary to do the science that they wanted to do. From this needs assessment and based on lessons-learned from the SOHO build  launch and data they began to develop the preliminary ideas for the next Heliophysics strategic mission.  For the SDO  Lockheed Martin  Solar and Astrophysics Laboratory was selected to build and operate the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)  and to build the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI). HMI would be operated and the huge data stream (~4 TB per day) managed at Stanford University  while the University of Colorado  Boulder would build and operate the Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE).  Phase A- 2002- The deliverable at the end of Phase A is System Concept Study report which contains  more specific instrument requirements  a more complete budget.   Phase B- 2003- During Phase B  the preliminary plan is converted into a baseline technical solution - requirements are further defined  schedules are determined  and specifications are prepared to initiate system design and development. The deliverable at the end of the phase is the Preliminary Design review document  which sets out very specific requirements for the build and testing of the instruments down to how many threads a bolt will have  and the exact pressure that will be used to attach said bolt.  Phase C and D- Build  Integration and Testing- 2004 Phase C represents the beginning of the implementation stage. The Phase C deliverable is the Critical Design Review  There is a lot of activity in Phase C including: ·      Procurement of all aspects of the space craft o   Announcements of opportunity go out in 2005 for technical aspects of the space craft.  These announcements unlike the instrument announcements contain of the design and technical specifications required. o   Manpower profile peak- All manners of engineers are modeling  building and testing every aspect of the spacecraft for various factors  operations  ability to withstand space  integration with other spacecraft instruments and bus. o   HMI  EVE and AIA are built onsite at the subcontract locations o   The Testing of all of the parts of the spacecraft in the thermal vacuum chambers and on the vibration tables to ensure that they are space ready. Phase D Deliverable is the pre-ship review  and the completed and launched spacecraft. o     At this point there is a comprehensive audit in which all of the procurements are matched up with budget items and check lists Launch an initial commissioning takes place during phase D.  Phase E- Science mission and Operations- 2010 During Phase E science data is collected and made available to the public for scientific investigations that take place around the world.  The mission is monitored 24 hours a day 7 days a week by the mission operations team at Goddard Space Flight Center.  The instruments are monitored and operated at their respective institutions.  To date SDO has met minimum mission success  meaning it has fulfilled all of the mission goals.  It has taken over 100 million images of the sun and served 4500 terabytes of data.  http://sdoisgo.blogspot.com/2013/06/how-long-did-it-take-to-plan-and-design.html, LER, photo

And here is my first video from today's rather huge solar flare. Right at midnight UT time the active region 1429 unleashed a powerful X5.4-class solar flare. X-class flares are the strongest of the flares. They are major events that can trigger planet-wide radio blackouts and long-lasting radiation storms.  It appears that right after the large X5.4 flare another slightly lower  X1 flare (5 times smaller)  occurred. You can clearly see a wave going across the Sun.   We are still gathering data and the Space Weather Forecast Lab will be having updates available soon.   Credit: NASA SDO, LER, video

Another favorite is the 193 angstroms channel - here we see the Sun's outer atmosphere called Corona. Dark areas here are called coronal holes and are places where very little radiation is emitted  yet are the main source of solar wind particles.   Credit: NASA SDO, LER, photo
Also at 19:09 UT but seen through 304 angstrom  the M1-class flare can be seen looking bright.   This channel is especially good at showing areas where cooler dense plumes of plasma (filaments and prominences) are located above the visible surface of the Sun. Many of these features either can’t be seen or appear as dark lines in the other channels. The bright areas show places where the plasma has a high density.  Credit: NASA SDO, LER, photo

The EVE instrument is the 3rd instrument on SDO.   This channel is a lower resolution image (approx. 256x256 pixels) of the Sun in the wavelength range from 0.1-7nm. Because this is a large wavelength range  there are many different emissions from ions as well as continuum emissions with this band. This image clearly shows where active regions and flares occur.   Where: Active regions of the corona and flares.  Wavelength: 0.1-7 nm (Soft X-rays) Primary ions seen: Lots of highly ionized emissions and the free-free continuum (this is a very broadband  large wavelength range channel).

I work as an electrical system design engineer on the overall system architecture for the Space Launch System (SLS) core stage flight avionics  specifically the Command Telemetry Controller (CTC). It’s an important  unique component  as the central communication portal for our vehicle core stage element.   During the mission  the two CTCs on the vehicle are the primary collectors of data for telemetry downlink.  The CTCs format the data stream from cameras  over a thousand sensors  and the flight computer’s operations. That data stream is directed to the vehicle radios for downlink to ground stations. While the vehicle is on the launch pad  the CTCs are the conduit between ground operations and the flight computers.  In this mode  the CTCs perform a critical safety function.   The biggest challenge of my current work is not only to make this complex electronic box work in a short period of time  but to integrate it with other boxes properly. It’s a fun and challenging job  but you really need to be enthusiastic about what you are doing in order to have such commitment. It’s rewarding work  and I feel patriotic about it because I’m helping provide America the next-generation heavy-lift vehicle that will carry astronauts safely on different missions.   It was always interesting to me to watch the shuttle flights on television when I was young because there are limited Space Programs available in Taiwan.  To be part of the SLS Program satisfies a dream I had when I was a kid  and I’m looking forward to watching the launch with my two daughters some day.  I’d advise anyone who has aspirations to work in space exploration to study hard  do the things you love to do and do not be afraid to make mistakes., LER, photo

The NASA fireball camera at the Tellus Museum in Cartersville  Georgia caught these nearly simultaneous fireballs at 5:44 AM EDT on May 6. The first is a faint streak just a bit above and to the right of the center of the image; the second - which is much brighter- immediately follows off to the right at the top edge of the clouds. These were not automatically picked up in our other cameras  so we do not have trajectories and cannot definitively identify them as eta Aquarids. However  an overlay of the star field (link below) suggests that they probably are  as the meteors appear to originate from close to the meteor shower radiant (the plus sign labeled ETA).  http://fireballs.ndc.nasa.gov/special/eAQR_2012/dbl_eta_Aqr.jpg, LER, video
The NASA all sky meteor cameras detected 7 Eta Aquarid fireballs last night  6 of them between 3:45 and 4:30 a.m. PDT - a span of only 45 minutes! In this video  an Eta streaks at 152 000 mph above Las Cruces  New Mexico. At such speeds  the half-ounce piece of Halley's Comet lasts only a second before meeting a fiery demise 53 miles above Earth's surface., LER, video

In October 2014  comet C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring) will pass extremely close to Mars at approximately 138 000km (~85 000 miles).

USS San Diego comes into port at Naval Base San Diego following completion of the initial round of Orion recovery test operations. The US Navy and NASA test team successfully recovered the Orion Forward Bay Cover and Parachutes  practiced air operations  and completed mission coordination exercises between the ship’s crew and Mission Control Center at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. The at-sea crew module recovery testing concluded early when the team experienced excessive water turbulence in the ship’s well deck.  Following analysis by the recovery team  the underway testing will be rescheduled for a later date., HER, photo
A test version of the Orion spacecraft is tethered inside the well deck of the USS San Diego prior to tests that will allow NASA and the Navy to practice the procedures they'll use to recover Orion from the Pacific Ocean this fall. To safely bring Orion home after splashdown  it will be towed into the flooded well deck and secured in a specially-designed cradle before the water is drained., HER, photo
Members of the Orion recovery team work to retrieve a test version of Orion's forward bay cover  a protective shell that fits on top of the crew module  from the Pacific Ocean on Wednesday  during the Underway Recovery Test. NASA and U.S. Navy personnel have come together on board the USS San Diego  off the coast of California  to practice the processes they'll use to recover Orion after its splashdown following its first flight test this fall., HER, photo
The Orion boilerplate test article awaits loading on to the USS San Diego in preparation for the underway recovery test. During the recovery test in San Diego  the spacecraft will be set adrift in open and unstable waters  providing NASA and the Navy the opportunity to recover the capsule into the well deck of the USS San Diego. While deployed  the team will seek out various sea states in which to practice the capsule recovery procedure in an effort to build their knowledge base of how the capsule recovery differs in calm and rough seas and what are the true physical limits., HER, photo

When Orion reenters the Earth’s atmosphere from deep space  the FBC will be jettisoned at an altitude of approximately 23 000 feet. This event is crucial to mission success and crew safety—a successful jettison is required for deployment of the main parachutes, HER, link

While watching every episode of Star Trek with my mom it never dawned on me that I might one day be doing the same job as Scotty  engineer for the USS Enterprise.    Today  I am a test engineer for NASA’s new human exploration spacecraft -- Orion. And much like Scotty  my job is to troubleshoot and test the spacecraft’s systems before flight to make sure Orion will be able to boldly go where no man or woman has gone before.  The coolest part of my job is working with the actual hardware that will fly in space and working with people from all disciplines of aerospace engineering. I am embedded with the Lockheed Martin Assembly Test & Launch Operations team working in the Orion Integrated Test Lab in Denver  where we developed the procedures that run flight software for the vehicle.  The initial power-on of the spacecraft at Kennedy Space Center was a major accomplishment for me and the team. This test confirmed the successful operation of the spacecraft Power and Data Units and the Vehicle Management Computer that run Orion’s flight software. Much like the “brains of the spacecraft” these systems work in sync to command the spacecraft’s maneuvers and operations during flight.   I grew up in Sugar Land  Texas  and graduated with a degree in electrical engineering from Texas A&M University. My advice to young people is to focus on general problem-solving skills and people skills. In order to accomplish your tasks  it is likely you will need help from many different people.

Growing up on the west coast of Florida in the 1960s  my interest in space came from helping my dad build airplanes in our garage and hanging out at the airport with him.  These experiences made me wonder what made airplanes fly and made me want to be a pilot.  On July 20  1969  like most other 6-year-olds that day  I was sitting in front of our black-and-white TV  eating a grilled cheese sandwich and watching the Apollo 11 lunar landing. After that historic event  I would go outside and look at our moon and know that people were there. It was a very impressive moment and had a significant impact on me.   After watching the lunar landing  I could not think of a better place to fly than in space!  However  it took a very long time from thinking that was “really cool” before it ever crossed my mind that I could actually become an astronaut.  My interest in planes and flying led me to earn a Bachelor of Engineering from Embry Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida.  After graduating  I worked for several years at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on shuttle operations and loved working with hardware.  During that time  I earned a Master of Engineering Management from the University of Central Florida.  It wasn’t until I was working at KSC and started to interact with crew members around the center that I thought I might want to become an astronaut. I had mentors who encouraged me to apply for the NASA astronaut corps and  quite honestly  I don’t think I would have actually picked up the pen to fill out the paper without encouragement from people who saw something in me that I didn’t necessarily appreciate in myself.  I was selected and reported to the Astronaut Training Office in 2000.  Since then  I have flown as a mission specialist aboard two shuttle missions – STS-128 and STS-133 -- and served as a long duration crew member for International Space Station Expeditions 20 and 21.    Today  I am an experienced engineer and NASA Astronaut enjoying the hands-on opportunity to help build Orion  NASA’s first human-rated  deep-space exploration spacecraft. I am part of the astronaut team working in the full-size Orion mockups at Johnson Space Center in Houston to help evaluate the operation of the spacecraft.  It has been incredible to watch Orion progress from design concept to the actual spacecraft we will launch at next year’s flight test – http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79V-TBVieOg.   Having flown on the space shuttle and space station  it has been really cool to watch the evolution of how we build upon our heritage technologies to create new spaceflight capabilities  such as upgraded cockpit displays and more automated operations.  We have also advanced the Apollo program’s launch abort system to ensure optimal crew safety during launch and ascent.  What I love most about my job is that there is always something cool and exciting going on.  From working on space shuttle hardware on the ground to flying shuttle and space station missions  it’s been amazing to see all the work going on at NASA – on the ground and on orbit!  In addition to working on Orion’s development  I have the unique opportunity to be involved with the private companies building crew and cargo transport vehicles for the space station.  I am most proud of how we work together as a crew.  Not just as a crew on orbit  but the entire crew on the ground -- whether it’s Mission Control  the trainers  engineering or support.  It is so great to work well together; it really feels more like a family to me.   I tell young people to pay attention to what they enjoy doing most and let that drive the choices they make -- whether it’s hobbies  education or the career they choose.  I believe if you pay attention to what you enjoy doing  the opportunities and possibilities will find you.   http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/stott-np.html, HER, photo

As a child  I had an interest in planets and space  always loving math and science. I grew up tinkering with broken items around the house  trying to figure out how to repair them. Little did I know that I would turn my childhood interests into a career at NASA and more specifically  get to work on the Orion spacecraft that will take astronauts up into space.  My job as a NASA Langley Research Center Orion configuration manager gives me the ability to see everything put together and tested for Orion and l love every minute of it. My main role for the Orion team is to assist the project managers to ensure we follow specific guidelines to build each necessary section of Orion. So for example  I make sure that the documents and artifacts used to build each section and part are collected and stored and all changes or deviations from the original plan are captured.   The best part about it is that I get to watch an idea turn into reality. One of my favorite tests was when we dropped the Orion spacecraft test article into our Hydro Impact Basin. This article shows the video of the test: http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/mpcv/mpcv-splashtest-jul21.html   One of my most proud moments was walking through the gate for the first time as a NASA employee.  It was an amazing feeling to end up working at a place I only dreamed of  but never thought of it becoming reality. It makes you think that dreams really can come true.  Because of my passion for my job  I jump at the chance to volunteer at every Orion outreach activity I can. It’s so important to me to inform the public that yes  NASA is still planning on sending humans to space. Sharing about NASA and the Orion spacecraft not only inspires me  but also families  the public and most crucially  our next generation workforce.   My advice to young people: Follow your passion—figure out what you love to do  get involved  and most importantly  ask questions., HER, photo

I put stress to the test everyday I’m at work. As a stress analyst for the Orion Program  I examine every nook  cranny and crevice of the spacecraft to determine what levels of stress it can handle throughout its entire spaceflight – from launch to landing and everywhere in between.  I'm responsible for the foundation of the primary structure  which is the pressure vessel that will serve as the astronauts’ transportation and shelter during deep space missions throughout our solar system.  On the stress analyst team  we work all the numbers and serve as the overall systems integrators. It’s our job to make sure the Orion team can prove that the spacecraft’s structural integrity and stability assessments are accurate. We push the limits of spacecraft design every day in order to reduce mass  simplify systems and ensure every component is sized correctly to withstand every different regimes throughout a mission.  We’re the folks who stand up at the end of the day and say "Yes  we're good to fly and I can put it on the table and prove it." It’s a high-stress job  but that’s what we do best.  I’m most proud of the completion of the static loads testing on the Orion crew module. We drove the spacecraft to its pressure limits to make sure we’re operating in the most safe  conscious path forward with the vehicle. The crew module is the prized piece of the Orion program. It is in our hands and the pressure is on to make sure we don’t break it. Some people thrive under that pressure and I’m one of them. I enjoy challenges.  The coolest part of my job is being able to see the spacecraft come to fruition from the beginning  middle  and all the way to the end. As a stress analyst  you stay with the spacecraft from cradle to grave because you’re that person who is ultimately responsible for that hardware. And besides  who wouldn’t think a spacecraft is cool and fun to work on?  As a young native American growing up in a small fishing community south of New Orleans  I grew up shrimping – that’s what we did as a family  that’s what we did as a community. I did well in school and earned a bachelor’s in mechanical engineering from Louisiana State University and a master’s of engineering from the University of New Orleans. At the age of 22  I was scheduled to accept an internship at a local Engineering firm in New Orleans  LA.  However  I got a phone call to come work on the External Tank program at NASA’s Michoud Assembly Facility and thought it would be extremely cool to come and work on this stuff. I worked as an intern during NASA’s Return to Flight phase following the Columbia accident. It felt like a good fit and I returned to Lockheed Martin as a full time employee.  To those people undecided about their future careers  I would say that not everyone is an engineer  not everyone is a teacher  not everyone is like everyone else. If you find your profession  if you find what you like  be the best you can be. If you’re going to sweep floors  be the best floor sweeper you can be. If you’re going to be an engineer  be the best engineer you can be.  Don’t settle for second best. Don’t be afraid to roll up your sleeves and work hard  sometimes it’s just what you have to do.  Sometimes it falls on a few people’s shoulders. You shouldn’t shy away from it - keeping your head down and keep coloring. There will be good times and bad times  but if you keep coloring you will get down to the end of the road  you will be done  and you will be proud of yourself., HER, photo

My career has taken flight to new heights that I never imagined before.  As a parachute consultant for the Orion Spacecraft  I find myself working at over 10 000 feet to ensure the parachute system tests go as planned.  There are a lot of cool aspects to my job: learning new systems and working with extraordinary people.  I enjoy working with the photographers on the chase helicopter during the parachute drop tests. I'm in the helicopter with the doors open  working with the team to make real time decisions to capture the right shots.  I bring experience to Orion from my work for the Navy -- parachutes for ejection seats and bailout systems and chutes of all sizes for anything we need to slow down. I also work with the NASA Jet Propulsion Lab helping to design chutes for a Mars landing.  Designing for Mars presents a whole new set of challenges and we’ll use this knowledge when humans travel to Mars on Orion.   I am proud that the work I do can and does save lives. It was very rewarding to work on the bailout system for the Shuttle astronauts  knowing that they could escape if there was a problem. My greatest accomplishment is working on a parachute system that saved the lives of a crew after their Navy aircraft caught fire.   I was born in Des Moines Iowa and grew up in Jefferson City Missouri. I was inspired by my older brother  who was an engineer. I graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Missouri  Columbia and began working at the Naval Warfare Center a year later.  In 2005 my colleagues asked me to join the Orion Program.   I would tell students that there is a world of opportunities in the engineering field. Engineers have a chance to make a difference not only in the space program but in the lives of families and people all over the world., HER, photo
As program director for ATK’s Launch Abort Motor program  I’m fortunate to be so involved with design  development  test and evaluation of the motor that will ultimately save crew lives  if needed. While the launch abort motor for EFT-1 is configured with inert propellant since the EFT-1 mission will have no crew on board  it otherwise replicates the launch abort system that will ensure astronaut safety on future crewed Orion exploration missions using the NASA’s new Space Launch System (SLS).  The coolest part of my job thus far is witnessing the successful abort motor ground and flight tests. It has always been a highlight to see the hard work in design and development come together in a test demonstration. Check out our cool test video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbOt085uvBY.  I grew up in a small town in Utah  and my interest in space came from observing my father’s interest and work in aerospace as an engineer.  My interest in space exploration expanded by observing the rapid-pace space program in the sixties. I can vividly remember watching live video of the first men walking on the moon—the amazement of that experience has never left me. I eventually got an engineering degree from Utah State where I majored in mechanical engineering.  What interested me in working with the Orion program was the tremendous opportunity to work on the newest vehicle for space exploration as well as the critical role the Launch Abort System has in crew safety.   My advice to students would be to learn about the things space exploration has provided as well as dream about what it could provide in the future. Study all the science and math available to prepare yourself with a solid foundation  and then vigorously pursue your dreams and opportunities that open up to you., HER, photo
Now that we’re within 15 months of our first orbital space flight  things are really heating up for me as Orion’s active thermal control system manager. My priorities right now are to ensure our hardware is delivered on time for installation on the Exploration Flight Test-1 spacecraft.  In addition to protecting our crew from the searing heat generated during Orion’s re-entry into the Earth’s atmosphere at 25 000 mph  I serve as the deputy system manager for the environmental control and life support system. I’m responsible for making sure these systems perform their functions properly on the spacecraft to keep our astronauts comfortable and protected throughout the entire duration of the mission so they can focus on their work at hand.  While hot topics usually consume a large part of my day  the coolest part of my job is being responsible for designing and building hardware that actually flies in space. It’s an extreme environment and I like the unique challenges we have to solve every day.  Growing up in Bloomington  Indiana  I was first captivated by space when we watched a program about the space shuttle in elementary school. I was instantly hooked.  The idea of building space vehicles and exploring other planets really hit a nerve in me and I’ve stayed with it ever since.    During my first job in human space flight  I worked on the International Space Station as the external active thermal control subsystem manager.  Knowing that I supported NASA’s efforts to keep astronauts living and working space has been truly rewarding. It’s still exciting for me to look up into the night sky to see if I can see the station fly over my house.   In 2006 I was excited to have the opportunity to join the Orion Program and apply my experience from working on station. Getting the chance to see the requirements written for a new spacecraft was an interesting start.  I graduated from Purdue University with a Bachelors of Science in Mechanical Engineering and later earned a Masters of Systems Engineering from the Stevens Institute. My advice to students: Pay attention to the practical applications of the theories  the science and the math. Take advantage of internship or co-op experiences and put what you learn to use!, HER, photo

I’m a perfect example that you’re never too young to start planning your career in space. I first became interested in space on May 12  1989  at the age of 5. I remember that day vividly because it was our Mother’s Day concert at my kindergarten in Warden  which is a small irrigated farming town in eastern Washington.   My kindergarten teacher  Mrs. Clark  taught us a song called “Mission Control.” I had a small solo in it which was  “I may be small but I’m growing  watch one day and you’ll see  space is wide open and waiting for me.” I thought it was amazing that people could go to space and talk to people on the ground  and I really thought that I was going to be an astronaut. It was never a question of “if” but “when.”  Well  as it turns out  space was waiting for me.  After earning my degree in Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering from the University of Washington  Lockheed Martin welcomed me to their Space Systems team in 2006. I remember watching the live broadcast of NASA awarding the Orion contract to Lockheed Martin at the end of August that year  and that’s when I knew that I wanted to work on human spaceflight and that Orion would be the next step in my career.   Today  I work as a Test Engineer for the Assembly  Test  & Launch Operations (ATLO) group. We bring all the parts of the Orion spacecraft together and integrate them while simultaneously testing them to make sure we build upon working components. I write the test procedures and test scripts that connect the parts together  and then power them on to make sure the commands from test control are reaching the correct component  be it a thruster or an onboard computer.   The coolest part of my job is working with the hardware. I get to see the actual spacecraft come together and know that I played an important part in it. Then to top it all off  I get to get Orion ready for launch  and watch it rocket into space from the Kennedy Space Center next year! Watching my tests confirm that the spacecraft is working the way the engineers designed it to makes me not only proud of myself  but proud of the entire Orion team.  My advice to students interested in the space program and hands-on work with spacecraft is to work hard in high school  apply to every scholarship available  study hard in college  get a degree in engineering  and make sure the person interviewing you for the job knows it would be a mistake to hire anybody but you. And most important  make sure you do what I just said  one day at a time., HER, photo
I’m one of the kids of the 1960’s Apollo Program. As an eight year-old kid I watched Neil Armstrong walk on the moon. Since then  all my education was focused on working at NASA.   While at University of Cincinnati I had the chance to co-op at NASA - this is what led me here for my career.  I work with teams of people across NASA to develop the propulsion systems that allow the Orion spacecraft to fly safely in space and on re-entry.  We are working to make the vehicle the most safe and successful vehicle that we can.  The absolute coolest part of this job is making fire and smoke. This is the place to be if you like testing engines and hardware.   My recommendation for students:  Continue to pursue your education in engineering  the sciences and mathematics. I believe that future generations are going to have more opportunities to go places that we never even dreamed of and what we are putting in place now is just the beginning.  The future is brighter than ever before., HER, photo
As a senior software engineer working on Orion  I am responsible for software/hardware integration and testing to ensure all the spacecraft’s computer commands perform as expected for America’s next generation spacecraft destined for deep space.  Working with bits and bytes all day is much cooler than you might think. I get to simulate Orion missions almost every day  just as if we’re flying in space. I test the systems from launch  through flight and back to Earth. If I find any issues  I resolve them and retest to ensure a smooth and safe flight for our future crews.  As a young girl growing up in Gaza City  Palestine  watching the space shuttle takeoff and come back to Earth always amazed me. That’s what inspired me to become part of the space program.  I came to Houston to pursue my degree in engineering from the University of Houston at Clear Lake. Soon after graduation  I  began work on the Space Shuttle Program. When the shuttle retired I saw Orion as the new beginning for the next human spaceflight program  and I wanted to be part of it.  My advice to young girls around the world: Always have a dream  dream big  and work really hard to make your dream come true. Mine did., HER, photo
I became interested in space as a young kid.  I grew up in Houston going on field trips to the Johnson Space Center and watched astronauts train in a zero gravity environment.  I imagined how cool it would be to do that myself. I graduated from Florida State University as a software engineer and joined Lockheed Martin to start my career in space.  My job is to manage the Lockheed Martin Exploration Development Laboratory where we test software for the systems that control the Orion Spacecraft. The coolest part of my job is when I sit in the mission simulators to see what our astronauts will see on a real mission.   One of my most proud moments was being a part of the testing for the successful Pad Abort launch.  The information from the tests helped improve the design to provide a safe escape for the crew in an emergency situation. My role was to manage the daily activities of the lab that includes scheduling the simulator hardware  controlling the configuration  and actually going on the simulator and running mission tests.  I joined Orion to be involved in the wave of the future--in space exploration.  Orion will take us to places where no one has ever been before and I wanted to be a part of it.   My advice to young people:  Don’t let anybody tell you that something is not possible.  Work hard  use your imagination and you can go as far as you dream you can go., HER, photo
I work aerothermodynamics for the Orion Program. This means I look at how airflow heats a spacecraft as it comes back to Earth from outer space. I predict how hot the Orion spacecraft will get as it re-enters the atmosphere. Our goal is to protect the crew by making sure the capsule doesn’t overheat.  The most exciting part of my job is when I test scaled-down spacecraft in the wind tunnels. We simulate the airflow around the spacecraft and take heating measurements. The best part is when we use our computer programs to predict the measurements and they match the results from the wind tunnel test!   Growing up in Iowa  I never thought that I would actually work for NASA. But I kept studying math and science through school and applied for a NASA internship while in college. Now that I work at NASA  I'm excited to keep exploring  to push our current understanding of the Earth and our Solar System. The more we learn about what's out there  the more knowledge we bring back to help us on Earth., HER, photo

There are many paths that lead people to NASA. I didn’t initially pursue a career at NASA but am very glad my path brought me here. I grew up in Madison  Indiana and received my mechanical engineering degree from Valparaiso University.  After graduation  I went to work in the aerospace industry where I later became interested in the space program through a friend.  I came to work at NASA and was fortunate to work on the Space Shuttle program for many years.  Coming to Orion gave me the opportunity to work on an exciting new program and help set the stage for NASA to go beyond low earth orbit.  My job as the Orion’s Landing and Recovery Systems Functional Manager is to make sure the hardware--the parachutes  mortars and uprighting system are built and tested to ensure a safe  smooth landing for the crew.  The environment of space is very unforgiving of mistakes. I’m helping to develop and build a system that’s critical to the survival of the crew and that makes it very personal to me.     I’m very proud of the engineers that get it done.  The team has been very successful in executing the test programs and achieving our goals while balancing the risk  schedule and cost.    My advice to young people:  be inquisitive  put in some long hours  ask questions  challenge assumptions and make sure you have all the data before making a decision., HER, photo
As Orion’s Chief Engineer  I am responsible for the overall technical leadership for the program. My job is to advise the program manager  provide technical resources and ensure that all engineering products meet technical standards.    I grew up making repairs around the house and decided to work for NASA in high school. You can find that sentiment written in my high school year book.    At nineteen  I came to NASA from Purdue University as part of the Cooperative Education Program.  That experience led me to focus on the engineering structures discipline at the NASA Johnson Space Center. After receiving my bachelor’s degree in Aerospace Engineering from Purdue University I earned a Master’s in Mechanical engineering from the University of Utah.  For me  NASA is like family. I am thrilled to be part of the team that is building Orion.  My advice to young people: Follow your passion—find something you love to do and make it your career., HER, photo
As the Mission Planning and Analysis lead for the Vehicle Integration Office  Nujoud is responsible for the sequence of mission events and ensuring Orion’s power and thermal systems performance will meet mission needs.

Nujoud is most proud of developing the crew optical alignment sight – a device that the crew put in the spacecraft window to align the vehicle to the stars or have reference for approaching spacecraft.   As a child  Nujoud had an interest in airplanes. Her father was also an engineer  making a career in aerospace engineering a logical progression., HER, photo

In this photo  Ed Shade  an Engineer at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt  Md. is putting final touches on thermal blankets in a vacuum chamber called the Space Environment Simulator  or SES that is being used to test components of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope.  Shade is laying blanketing on the wires on the floor to keep the heat they create from contaminating the other parts of the testbed. Those blankets are made of aluminized kapton  a polymer film that remains stable over a wide range of temperatures.  Just as blankets insulate people from cold  these golden-colored thermal blankets help prevent heat from seeping into the vacuum chamber that will drop temperatures to mimic those of deep space.  Blankets are also wrapped around pieces of equipment to protect them when they go into the SES. Components of the Webb will ultimately experience the cold of space in their operational orbit over 1 million miles from Earth and are tested in a deep freeze to ensure they will function properly.  The cables and cords seen in the photo are actually ground support equipment that include the Optical Telescope Simulator (OSIM)  for the James Webb Space Telescope. The cables and cords are part of the thermal controls and monitoring that will go on 24 hours a day for the next three months. The entire structure is monitored for thermal fluctuations.  The most powerful space telescope ever built  Webb is the successor to NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. Webb's four instruments will reveal how the universe evolved from the Big Bang to the formation of our solar system. Webb is a joint project of NASA  the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency.   http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/webb-telescope-test-insulating-from-heat-and-cold/#.Ui-KXby3KkF  Credit: Text  Rob Gutro.

Using infrared data from the Subaru Telescope in Hawaii  an international team of astronomers has imaged a giant planet around the bright star GJ 504. Several times the mass of Jupiter and similar in size  the new world  dubbed GJ 504b  is the lowest-mass planet ever detected around a star like the sun using direct imaging techniques.  "If we could travel to this giant planet  we would see a world still glowing from the heat of its formation with a color reminiscent of a dark cherry blossom  a dull magenta " said Michael McElwain  a member of the discovery team at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt  Md. He also adds that  "Studying these systems is a little like seeing our own planetary system in its youth."  http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/astronomers-image-lowest-mass-exoplanet-around-a-sun-like-star/#.UgOyIlO3KkH  Besides observing planetary atmospheres  the infrared James Webb Space Telescope will also carry coronographs to enable photography of exoplanets near bright stars (if they are big and bright and far from the star).

NASA Spitzer - mapping cosmic carbon across the universe! http://www.nasa.gov/topics/universe/features/evolution-of-cosmic-carbon-pah.html  About the image: For the first time  scientists are able to automatically interpret previously unknown infrared emissions from space that come from surprisingly complex organic molecules  called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)  which are abundant and important across the universe. They use spectra of infrared radiation to identify unknown substances in space. These spectra are as good as fingerprints for identification purposes. Analyzing the PAH bands represents a powerful new astronomical tool to trace the evolution of cosmic carbon and  at the same time  probe conditions across the universe.

About the image: This discovery image  taken by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope  shows five moons orbiting the distant  icy dwarf planet Pluto. The darker stripe in the centre of the image is because the picture is constructed from a long exposure designed to capture the comparatively faint satellites of Nix  Hydra  Kerberos and Styx  and a shorter exposure to capture Pluto and Charon  which are much brighter. Kerberos has an estimated diameter of 13 to 34 kilometres  and Styx is thought to be irregular in shape and 10 to 25 kilometres across. Credit: NASA  ESA and M. Showalter (SETI Institute), HER, photo

It is located approximately 10 million light-years away in the Cepheus constellation. This image was captured as part of the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxy Survey (SINGS) Legacy Project using the telescope's Infrared Array Camera (IRAC).  The "glowing" red emission reveals regions in the galaxy that are actively forming new stars. The blue dots sprinkled along this image are Milky Way stars along this line of sight.  The SINGS image is a four channel false color composite  where blue indicates emission at 3.6 microns  green corresponds to 4.5 microns  and red to 5.8 and 8.0 microns. The contribution from starlight (measured at 3.6 microns) in this picture has been subtracted from the 5.8 and 8 micron images to enhance the visibility of the dust features."

Practice Makes Perfect With Webb Telescope Mirror Placement  NASA engineers and scientists have been making practice runs to ensure the placement of primary mirror segments on the James Webb Space Telescope go perfectly when the flight equipment is ready. NASA issued a video and photos showing the practice run in the giant clean room at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt  Md.  The video explains and shows how a grey/silver robotic "arm" is used to install the surrogate mirrors onto a test copy of a structure called the telescope "backplane." The surrogate mirror segment is the same mass and hexagonal shape as an actual flight mirror. The test is practice for the placement of the actual flight mirror segments onto the flight telescope structure at a later date.

Infrared light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum - but just like visible light covers a range of different wavelengths (or colors as we see them)  infrared covers a range from near to mid to far infrared.    To illustrate that different infrared wavelengths can give us very different views of an object  here is a look at the Whirlpool galaxy.  (P.S. The James Webb Space Telescope has near and mid-infrared instruments  and combined with a 6.5 meter diameter mirror  will give us spectacular imagery.), HER, photo
How much gold is used to coat Webb's mirrors?  About a golf ball's worth!  Here's the calculation. The thickness of gold coating = 100 x 10^-9 meters (1000 angstroms). Surface area = 25 m^2. Using these numbers plus the density of gold at room temperature (19.3 x 10^-6 g/m^3)  the coating is calculated to use 48.25g of gold  about equal to a golf ball. (A golf ball weighs 45.9 grams.)

We recently answered this question about the timeline after the James Webb Space Telescope launches.  So we added it to our FAQ: http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/faq.html#howdeploy  It's a little bit technical  but here is what happens:  In the first hour: Webb will separate from the Ariane V launch vehicle a half hour after launch and we will deploy the solar array immediately afterward. We will also release several systems that were locked for launch.  In the first day: Two hours after launch we will deploy the high gain antenna. Twelve hours after launch there will be the first trajectory correction maneuver.      In the first week: The second trajectory correction maneuver will take place at 2.5 days after launch. We will start the sequence of major deployment just after that. The first deployments are the fore and aft sunshield pallets  followed by the release of remaining sub-system launch locks. The next deployment is the telescope which is lifted off the spacecraft bus by the deployable tower assembly. The full sunshield deployment can then be initiated. At 6 days we deploy the secondary mirror  followed by the side wings of the primary mirror.  In the first month: As the telescope cools down  we will turn on the warm electronics and initialize the flight software. At the end of the first month  we will do the mid-course correction to ensure that Webb will achieve its final orbit at the second Lagrange point (L2). During the first month the telescope cools to near its operating temperature  but the ISIM is heated to prevent condensation on the instruments.      In the second month: At 33 days after launch we will turn on and operate the Fine Guidance Sensor  then NIRCam and NIRSpec. The first NIRCam image will be of a crowded star field to make sure that light gets through the telescope into the instruments. Since the primary mirror segments will not yet be aligned  the picture will still be out of focus. At 44 days after launch we will begin the process of adjusting the primary mirror segments  first identifying each mirror segment with its image of a star in the camera. We will also focus the secondary mirror.  In the third month: From 60 to 90 days after launch we will align the primary mirror segments so that they can work together as a single optical surface. We will also turn on and operate the MIRI. By the end of the third month we will be able to take the first science-quality images. Also by this time  Webb will complete its initial orbit around L2.  In the fourth through the sixth month: At about 85 days after launch we will have completed the optimization of the telescope image in the NIRCam. Over the next month and a half we will optimize the image for the other instruments. We will test and calibrate all of the instrument capabilities by observing representative science targets.  After six months: Webb will conduct routine science operations., HER, photo
Here's an answer to a recently asked question. Why are we not building the James Webb Space Telescope on the International Space Station?  In the very earliest stages of feasibility studies NASA examined the possibility of on-orbit assembly for what was then called the next generation space telescope or NGST.  At that time  and still today  the ISS does not have the capability to assemble precision optical structures.  Additionally  the environment around the ISS is not suitable for the exposed optics that JWST has and would have had the possibility to damage or contaminate the optics.  The deployment of Webb happens far above Low Earth Orbit and the debris that resides there.  Finally  if the ISS were used as a stopping point for the observatory we would have needed a second rocket to launch it to its final destination at L2.  The observatory would have to be designed  with much more mass to withstand this “second launch” leaving less mass for the mirrors and science instruments., HER, photo
Here's the answer to one of our frequently asked questions - how does the James Webb Space Telescope compare to Herschel?  NASAblueshift just did a blog post on this: http://astrophysics.gsfc.nasa.gov/outreach/podcast/wordpress/index.php/2013/02/11/andromeda-in-the-infrared/, HER, photo

The image (on the left) has been posted everywhere today  but we couldn't resist posting it too  because it's so beautiful.  It shows galaxy M106 and was made by renowned astro-photographer Robert Gendler  who took data from the Hubble Space Telescope archive and combined it with his own ground-based observations.    We thought it was interesting to compare it to the image on the right  which is infrared data from Spitzer and X-ray data from Chandra.    Each wavelength gives a different view of the structure of this galaxy.   As Phil Plait notes  "...those red frills  streamers of gas at odd angles to the rest of the galaxy  one each on opposite sides of the galaxy’s core. These are called its anomalous arms  because they don’t line up well at all with M106’s more obvious spiral arms. The red color is a giveaway that we’re seeing gas being warmed by an outside source; hydrogen glows at that color when excited. So what’s the engine behind that?  It turns out  that gas is being zapped by twin blasts of energy coming from material being voraciously consumed by the galaxy’s supermassive central black hole."  Here's a NASA feature on the Gendler's image http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/m106.html  and Phil Plait's blog about the galaxy: http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2013/02/05/spiral_galaxy_m106_a_galaxy_zapped_by_its_own_black_hole.html  Credit (left): NASA  ESA  the Hubble Heritage Team (STScI/AURA)  and R.

New photo for you of our 3rd flight primary mirror segment when it arrived at NASA Goddard!  Reflection in a Webb Telescope Mirror  The amazing mirrors that will fly aboard NASA's James Webb Space Telescope will allow the James Webb Space Telescope see farther away and further back in time to detect the light from the very first and most distant stars and galaxies. In this photo  an engineer's crystal clear reflection is seen on the surface of one of the primary mirror segments. The image is so clear you can see an expression of concentration in the engineer's face. Behind the engineer looking into the mirror's surface  the top part of the canister that the mirror was shipped in hangs from four straps. Other engineers use flashlights to inspect the mirror segment. More information: http://jwst.nasa.gov.   Credit: NASA/Chris Gunn, HER, photo

Another image of our golden secondary mirror!  A Clear Reflection on the Webb Telescope's Secondary Mirror  The sole secondary mirror and another primary mirror that will fly aboard NASA's James Webb Space Telescope arrived at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt  Md. on Nov. 5  2012. In this photo  technicians are inspecting the secondary mirror using flashlights. Reflections of one of the technicians and the roof of the giant clean room that houses the mirror are seen on the mirror's surface.  Unlike the 18 hexagonal primary mirror segments that make up the biggest mirror on the Webb telescope  the secondary mirror is perfectly rounded. The mirror is also convex  so the reflective surface bulges toward a light source. It looks much like a curved mirror that you'll see on the wall near the exit of a parking garage that lets motorists see around a corner.  The mirror is made of beryllium  which was selected for its stiffness  light weight and stability at cryogenic temperatures. Bare beryllium is not very reflective of near-infrared light  so each mirror is coated with gold. The microscopic gold coating enables the secondary mirror to efficiently reflect infrared light (which is what the Webb telescope's cameras see). The quality of the secondary mirror surface is so good that the final convex surface at cold temperatures does not deviate from the design by more than a few millionths of a millimeter - or about one ten thousandth the diameter of a human hair.  Previously on Sept. 17  2012  two other primary mirror segments arrived at NASA Goddard and are currently being stored in the giant clean room on campus. Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. of Boulder  Colo. manufactured the mirrors  packed  and shipped them to NASA Goddard.  The most powerful space telescope ever built  the Webb telescope will provide images of the first galaxies ever formed  and explore planets around distant stars. It is a joint project of NASA  the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency.

Today's image - our beautiful  golden flight secondary mirror!  Webb Telescope's Secondary Mirror Looks Like a Giant Sun  The round  gold coated secondary mirror that will fly aboard NASA's James Webb Space Telescope looks like a giant sun in this photo where technicians at NASA were securing it to a platform. What appears to be a track circling the mirror looks like the orbit a planet would take around the sun. The rounded shipping canister that the housed the mirror actually fit on that rounded "track."  Unlike the 18 hexagonal primary mirror segments that make up the biggest mirror on the Webb telescope  the secondary mirror is perfectly rounded. The mirror is also convex  so the reflective surface bulges toward a light source. It looks much like a curved mirror that you'll see on the wall near the exit of a parking garage that lets motorists see around a corner. This mirror is coated with a microscopic layer of gold to enable it to efficiently reflect infrared light (which is what the Webb telescope's cameras see).  "The thickness of the gold coating on the mirrors is only 100 nanometers thick  or a tenth of a micron  which is 1/10 000th of a millimeter " said Paul Geithner  Deputy Project Manager - Technical for the Webb telescope at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt  Md. "A human hair is roughly 1000 times thicker."  The mirror arrived at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt  Md. on Nov. 5  2012. The mirror previously resided at Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. of Boulder  Colo. who manufactured it.  The Webb telescope is the world’s next-generation space observatory and successor to the Hubble Space Telescope.

COCOA's operation and performance must be verified alone before it can be used to test Webb under conditions that the observatory will experience in space.  The Webb telescope includes 18 six-sided mirror segments  which work together to form one large  21.3-foot mirror.  COCOA was built by ITT Exelis of Rochester  N.Y.  and its subcontractor Micro Instruments in Rochester  N.Y.

Yes  the James Webb Space Telescope Mirrors 'Can'  The powerful primary mirrors of the James Webb Space Telescope will be able to detect the light from distant galaxies. The manufacturer of those mirrors  Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. of Boulder  Colo.  recently celebrated their successful efforts as mirror segments were packed up in special shipping canisters (cans) for shipping to NASA.  The Webb telescope has 21 mirrors  with 18 primary mirror segments working together as one large 21.3-foot (6.5-meter) primary mirror. The mirror segments are made of beryllium  which was selected for its stiffness  light weight and stability at cryogenic temperatures. Bare beryllium is not very reflective of near-infrared light  so each mirror is coated with about 0.12 ounce of gold.  Northrop Grumman Corp. Aerospace Systems is the principal contractor on the telescope and commissioned Ball for the optics system's development  design  manufacturing  integration and testing.  The Webb telescope is the world's next-generation space observatory and successor to the Hubble Space Telescope.

PHOTO:  The James Webb Space Telescope's Fine Guidance Sensor Arrives at NASA    - The Canadian Space Agency's contribution to the Webb mission  the Fine Guidance Sensor/Near InfraRed Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (FGS/NIRISS) arrived at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center  Greenbelt  Md. on July 30  2012. The FGS/NIRISS is the second instrument to arrive at NASA Goddard that will fly aboard the James Webb Space Telescope.  The Fine Guidance Sensor will enable the telescope to accurately and precisely point at the correct  intended objects for it to observe.  In this photo  technicians at NASA Goddard are meticulously removing the first half of FGS's clamshell shipping case as managing engineers and safety personnel stand by. Just below the lid  the gold tone of the instrument is visible through the multiple layers of contamination bagging which will be removed later.

Here's a full caption for you:  "This composite of 30 Doradus  aka the Tarantula Nebula  contains data from Chandra (blue)  Hubble (green)  and Spitzer (red). Located in the Large Magellanic Cloud  the Tarantula Nebula is one of the largest star-forming regions close to the Milky Way. Chandra's X-rays detect gas that has been heated to millions of degrees by stellar winds and supernovas. This high-energy stellar activity creates shock fronts  which are similar to sonic booms. Hubble reveals the light from massive stars at various stages of star birth  while Spitzer shows where the relatively cooler gas and dust lie."

A hundred years ago  scientists did not know that stars are powered by nuclear fusion  and 50 years ago they did not know that stars are continually forming in the Universe.  Researchers still do not know the details of how clouds of gas and dust collapse to form stars  or why most stars form in groups  or exactly how planetary systems form. Webb's superior imaging and spectroscopy capabilities will allow us to study stars as they are forming in their dusty cocoons. It will also be able to image disks around stars and study organic molecules that are important for life to develop.

Close cousins?  Comparison between Earth and Kepler-452b and their host stars  Scientists using data from NASA's Kepler mission have confirmed the first near-Earth-size planet orbiting in the habitable zone of a sun-like star. The habitable zone is the region around a star where temperatures are just right for water to exist in its liquid form.  The artistic concept compares Earth (left) to the new planet  called Kepler-452b  which is about 60 percent larger. The illustration represents one possible appearance for Kepler-452b -- scientists do not know whether the planet has oceans and continents like Earth.  Both planets orbit a G2-type star of about the same temperature; however  the star hosting Kepler-452b is 6 billion years old  1.5 billion years older than our sun. As stars age  they become larger  hotter and brighter  as represented in the illustration. Kepler-452b's star appears a bit larger and brighter.  Image credit: NASA Ames/JPL-Caltech/T. Pyle & W.

Over the holidays at the end of 1992  Lloyd Robinson  the CCD guru at UCO Lick in those days  had just retired and offered to set up a CCD system in the clean room in Santa Cruz to see what could be learned.  This star plate was a key component in that original setup.    When Jon Jenkins (Co-Investigator and Analysis Lead for Kepler) first set eyes on this plate in June  2010  he recognized it immediately  even though he had never seen it before. This was because one of his first tasks for the mission was the analysis of an untold number of images from a variety of tests using this plate. These tests were invaluable in discovering all sorts of ways for test setups to go wrong  from sagging light bulb filaments to liquid nitrogen fills. Based on what was learned  more sophisticated laboratory test systems were developed using a variety of other star plates. This painstaking laboratory work culminated in the very successful Kepler Test Demonstration (KTD)  which was instrumental in selling the Kepler Mission to NASA.

A planet transiting a spinning star will first block the approaching side of a star and then the receding side of a star when the planet orbits in the same direction the star spins.  The approaching side of the star emits blueshifted light while the receding side emits redshifted light.  In some cases  we can see the consequence of systematically blocking blue- and then red-shifted light in our doppler measurements.  The phenomenon is called the Rossiter-McLaughlin Effect.  The detection of the Rossiter-McLaughlin Effect in the doppler measurements of Kepler-8b helped to convince the science team that this was a bona-fide planet., LER, photo

The exoplanet upsilon Andromeda b is thought to be tidally locked so that the same hemisphere always faces the star it orbits.  However  astronomers reported today that the planet's surface appears to be brightest about 80 degrees away from the star-facing hemisphere.  This unexpected result is based on 5 days (about the time it takes for ups And b to make one orbit) of data taken with the Spitzer Space Telescope.  It'll be interesting to see if this behavior persists!  That might have to happen with different instruments.  These data were taken before Spitzer ran out of cryogen., LER, link
[Journey Log] On this same day  year 1745  died Jonathan Swift  Irish author  linked  linked to an enigma in the history of astronomy. Although Deimos and Phobos  Mars' moons  were not discovered until 1877  Swift wrote in 1720  in Gulliver's Travels  that the inhabitants of Laputa had made important astronomical observations including the two satellites of Mars  one orbiting with a period 10 hours and the other with a period of 21 hours. All sorts of theories appeared to explain the amazing coincidence. That Mars should have two satellites was an old idea  which Kepler had expressed in 1610 and others had elaborated further. But guessing the periods and distances of Deimos and Phobos to within 30% is a less likely coincidence. Will we ever know how?, LER, link

The pair of eclipsing stars in the upper corner are off in the distance but spatially aligned with the foreground star. Kepler can’t distinguish three separate stars and measures the total light from all of them.  When the distant pair eclipses  the total light dims a tiny bit like it would for a star+planet., LER, photo
[Journey Log] On this day in 1915  English physicist Henry Moseley (27) was killed in the WWI Battle of Gallipoli. Moseley showed that the order of elements in the periodic table depends on the number of protons in the nucleus. Did you know that about 92% of the atoms in the Universe are Hydrogen atoms?  And yet only 10% of the mass of the human body is hydrogen.  Go figure., LER, status

Planets in our own solar system have a wide range of properties. They are distinguished by two basic properties  their size and their orbit. The size determines if the planet can have a life-sustaining atmosphere. The orbit affects the surface temperature and whether there could be liquid water on the planet's surface. A habitable planet  one that could have liquid water on its surface must be between about 80% to 200% the diameter of Earth., LER, link

[Know more] The results from Kepler will come from measuring the brightness of the stars. The data will look like an EKG showing the heart beat. Whenever a planet passes in front of its parent star as viewed from our solar system it produces a tiny pulse or beat. From the repeated beats we can detect and confirm the existence of Earth-size planets and learn about the orbit and size of the planet.

[Know more] The habitable zone is the distance from a star where one can have liquid water on the surface of a planet. If a planet is too close to its parent star  it will be too hot and water would have evaporated. If a planet is too far from a star it is too cold and water is frozen. Stars come in a wide variety of sizes  masses and temperatures. Stars that are smaller  cooler and lower mass than the Sun (M-dwarfs) have their habitable zone much closer to the star than the Sun (G-dwarf). Stars that are larger  hotter and more massive than the Sun (A-dwarfs) have their habitable zone much farther out from the star., LER, link

The Hubble Source Catalog: Everything #Hubble Has Ever Seen in One Place  Astronomers at the Space Telescope Science Institute and the Johns Hopkins University  both in Baltimore  Maryland  have created a new master catalog of astronomical objects called the Hubble Source Catalog. The catalog provides one-stop shopping for measurements of objects observed with NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.  Hubble has amassed a rich legacy of images and other scientific data over its 25 years of exploring the universe. All of the images are stored in the computer-based Barbara A. Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST)  which astronomers use for their research. The archive is bursting with more than a million images  which contain roughly 100 million small sources ranging from distant galaxies to compact star clusters to individual stars. For astronomers  however  a major challenge is the difficulty involved with sifting through the archival gold mine to collect the data they want to analyze. The Hubble Source Catalog now allows astronomers to perform a computer search for characteristics of these sources  receiving information within seconds or minutes.  Join Hubble scientists during a live Hubble Hangout discussion about the Hubble Source Catalog at 3pm (EDT) on Thurs.  March 19 to learn more. Visit: http://hbbl.us/Fne .

NASA’s Hubble Observations Suggest Underground Ocean on Jupiter’s Largest Moon  NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope has the best evidence yet for an underground saltwater ocean on Ganymede  Jupiter’s largest moon. The subterranean ocean is thought to have more water than all the water on Earth’s surface.  Identifying liquid water is crucial in the search for habitable worlds beyond Earth and for the search of life as we know it.  “This discovery marks a significant milestone  highlighting what only Hubble can accomplish ” said John Grunsfeld  assistant administrator of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters  Washington. “In its 25 years in orbit  Hubble has made many scientific discoveries in our own solar system. A deep ocean under the icy crust of Ganymede opens up further exciting possibilities for life beyond Earth.”  Ganymede is the largest moon in our solar system and the only moon with its own magnetic field. The magnetic field causes aurorae  which are ribbons of glowing  hot electrified gas  in regions circling the north and south poles of the moon. Because Ganymede is close to Jupiter  it is also embedded in Jupiter’s magnetic field. When Jupiter’s magnetic field changes  the aurorae on Ganymede also change  “rocking” back and forth.  By watching the rocking motion of the two aurorae  scientists were able to determine that a large amount of saltwater exists beneath Ganymede’s crust affecting its magnetic field.

The Marvel of Gravitational Lensing by Dr. Frank Summers  One of the coolest marvels in the universe is a phenomenon known as "gravitational lensing".

Latest News: Astronomers have used NASA's Hubble Space Telescope to take the most detailed picture to date of a large  edge-on  gas-and-dust disk encircling the 20-million-year-old star Beta Pictoris.  Beta Pictoris remains the only directly imaged debris disk that has a giant planet (discovered in 2009). Because the orbital period is comparatively short (estimated to be between 18 and 22 years)  astronomers can see large motion in just a few years. This allows scientists to study how the Beta Pictoris disk is distorted by the presence of a massive planet embedded within the disk.  The new visible-light Hubble image traces the disk in closer to the star to within about 650 million miles of the star (which is inside the radius of Saturn's orbit about the Sun).  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2015/06/, HER, photo

Hubble Observes Comet Siding Spring Flyby with Mars  On Sunday  October 19th  the Hubble Space Telescope was pointed at Mars to observe the close approach of Comet Siding Spring.  The comet passed by Mars at approximately 87 000 miles (about one-third of the distance between Earth and the Moon). At that time  the comet and Mars were approximately 149 million miles from Earth.  This is a photo composite of the encounter of comet Siding Spring with Mars on October 19  2014. Separate Hubble Space Telescope images of Mars and the comet have been combined together into a single the picture. This is a composite image because a single exposure of the stellar background  comet Siding Spring  and Mars would be problematic because the objects are all moving with respect to each other and the background stars. Hubble can only track one planetary target at a time. Also  Mars is actually 10 000 times brighter than the comet  and the exposure here has been adjusted so that details on the Red Planet can be seen.

Hubble Maps the Temperature and Water Vapor on an Extreme Exoplanet  Located 260 light-years away  exoplanet WASP-43b is no place to call home. It is a world of extremes  where seething winds howl at the speed of sound from a 3 000-degree-Fahrenheit day side  hot enough to melt steel  to a pitch-black night side with plunging temperatures below 1 000 degrees Fahrenheit. The Hubble Space Telescope has been used to make the most detailed global map yet of the thermal glow from this turbulent world. The astronomers were also able to map temperatures at different layers of the world's atmosphere and traced the amount and distribution of water vapor. The Jupiter-sized planet lies so close to its orange dwarf host star that it completes an orbit in just 19 hours. The planet is also gravitationally locked so that it keeps one hemisphere facing the star.  Read more:  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2014/28/, HER, photo
Latest News: Astronomers have found an unlikely object in an improbable place: a monster black hole lurking inside one of the tiniest galaxies known. The dwarf galaxy containing the black hole  as illustrated in this artist's concept  is the densest galaxy ever seen  cramming 140 million stars within a diameter of about 300 light-years (just 1/500th of our Milky Way galaxy's diameter). However  the black hole inside the galaxy is five times the mass of the black hole at the center of our Milky Way. This suggests that the dwarf galaxy may actually be the stripped remnant of a larger galaxy that was torn apart during a close encounter with a more massive galaxy. The finding implies that there are many other compact galaxies in the universe that contain supermassive black holes. http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2014/41, HER, photo
This Hubble Space Telescope photo composite shows the location of supernova 1993J inside the majestic spiral galaxy M81.   Though astronomers saw the star explode as a supernova 21 years ago  the glow of that explosion is still present  as seen in the inset image. The supernova has faded to the point where astronomers are confident that they have picked up the ultraviolet glow of a very hot companion star.   This is the first time astronomers have been able to put constraints on the properties of the companion star in this unusual class of supernova called Type IIb. Hubble observations in ultraviolet light confirm the theory that the explosion originated in a double-star system where one star fueled the mass-loss from the aging primary star.

For over two decades astronomers have been patiently monitoring the fading glow of a supernova in a nearby galaxy. They've been looking for a suspected companion star that pulled off almost all of the hydrogen from the doomed star that exploded. At last Hubble's ultraviolet-light sensitivity pulled out the blue glow of the star from the cluttered starlight in the disk of the galaxy. This observation confirms the theory that the supernova originated in a double-star system where one star fueled the mass-loss from the aging primary star.

Astronomers using the Hubble  Spitzer and Herschel Space Telescopes have discovered a tiny powerhouse galaxy from the early universe with a growing core that is blazing with the light of millions of newborn stars  forming at a ferocious rate.  Although only a fraction of the size of the Milky Way  the tiny galaxy already contains about twice as many stars as our galaxy  all crammed into a region only 6 000 light-years across. The Milky Way is about 100 000 light-years across. Astronomers think the fledgling galaxy will continue to grow  possibly becoming a giant elliptical galaxy.  Dubbed 'Sparky' by the astronomers who made the discovery  the young galaxy is churning out stars at a prodigious rate. Sparky is producing roughly 300 stars per year. By comparison  the Milky Way produces roughly 10 stars per year.  Read more here: http://hubblesite.org/news/2014/37, HER, photo
Latest News: Supernovae are the most powerful stellar explosions in the universe. Some of them are produced by the detonation of a white dwarf  the stripped-down core of an ordinary star at the end of its life. But 12 years ago  astronomers began noticing weak stellar blasts  a kind of mini-supernova. When one such explosion occurred in the galaxy pictured here  NGC 1309  astronomers looking through Hubble archival images found for the first time the star system that produced the supernova blast of a white dwarf. http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2014/32/, HER, photo
Hubble Finds Three Surprisingly Dry Exoplanets  Challenging current exoplanet theories  the Hubble Space Telescope observed three planets  HD 189733b  HD 209458b  and WASP-12b  which are between 60 and 900 light-years away. These giant gaseous worlds are so hot  with temperatures between 1 500 and 4 000 degrees Fahrenheit  that they are ideal candidates for detecting water vapor in their atmospheres.  However  to the surprise of the researchers  the planets surveyed have only one-tenth to one one-thousandth the amount of water predicted by standard planet-formation theories.  http://hubblesite.org/news/2014/36, HER, photo

Astronomers routinely use #Hubble's crisp view to study all kinds of intricate details in galaxy clusters. By now you would think they've seen it all — but nature always has new surprises in store.  The latest is an uncanny 100 000-light-year-long structure that looks like a string of pearls twisted into a corkscrew shape that winds around the cores of two colliding galaxies. This Slinky-like structure forms a bridge between two giant elliptical galaxies that are colliding. The "pearls" on the Slinky are superclusters of blazing  blue-white  newly born stars. The whole assembly  which looks like a tug-of-war  must result from the gravitational tidal forces present in the collision.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2014/26/, HER, photo
Hubble Observations to Identify KBOs for New Horizon Flyby Next July are scheduled.  The Hubble Space Telescope will observe various areas in the outer solar system to help find Kuiper Belt Object targets for the New Horizons spacecraft to look at after it flies by Pluto in July 2015.  Below are the results of a preliminary search performed by Hubble from June 16th though the 26th to test the ability of Hubble to find the KBOs and to get an idea of how abundant they are in the vastness of the outer solar system.

Hubble Detects Gas Streamer Eclipsing a Black Hole Around Active Galaxy NGC 5548  Did you know that black holes have winds?  These winds can be extremely high  on order of 1000 kilometers per second  acting as a regulator for infalling material.  But now a new wind has arisen  with speeds as high as 5 000 kilometers per second and is much closer to the galaxy's nucleus than the slower  more persistent wind.  These winds can have a controlling effect over the growth of the black hole and its galaxy and they can only occur if they are shielded from X-Rays at their starting point.  This week  astronomers have directly measured one of these winds as a gas stream passes between the black hole and the Hubble Space Telescope.

Hubble Finds Dwarf Galaxies Produced a Large Proportion of the Stars in the Universe - and  they do it quickly!  Astronomers using the +Hubble Space Telescope studying dwarf galaxies from the early universe using the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) were able to calculate how much low-mass dwarf galaxies contributed to the star population in the universe.  “These galaxies are forming stars so quickly they could actually double their entire mass of stars in only 150 million years — an incredibly short astronomical timescale ” added co-author Jean-Paul Kneib  also of EPFL.  Astronomers say that such massive growth in a galaxy would take from 1 to 3 billion years in most 'normal' galaxies.  http://hubblesite.org/news/2014/25, HER, photo
Latest News: This image  from a new study called the Ultraviolet Coverage of the #Hubble Ultra Deep Field  provides the missing link in star formation.   Astronomers previously studied the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) in visible and near-infrared light in a series of images captured from 2003 to 2009. The HUDF shows a small section of space in the southern-hemisphere constellation Fornax. Now  using ultraviolet light  astronomers have combined the full range of colors available to Hubble  stretching all the way from ultraviolet to near-infrared light. The resulting image — made from 841 orbits of telescope viewing time — contains approximately 10 000 galaxies  extending back in time to within a few hundred million years of the big bang.  Ultraviolet light comes from the hottest  largest  and youngest stars. By observing at these wavelengths  researchers get a direct look at which galaxies are forming stars and where the stars are forming within those galaxies.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2014/27/, HER, photo

The densest galaxy in the nearby universe may have been found. The galaxy  known as M60-UCD1  is located near a massive elliptical galaxy NGC 4649  also called M60  about 54 million light-years from Earth. The arrow points to M60-UCD1.  Packed with an extraordinary number of stars  M60-UCD1 is an "ultra-compact dwarf galaxy." It is one of the most massive galaxies of its kind  weighing 200 million times more than our Sun. Remarkably  about half of this mass is found within a radius of only about 80 light-years. This would make the density of stars about 15 000 times greater than found in Earth's neighborhood in the Milky Way  meaning that the stars are about 25 times closer. http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2013/40/, HER, photo

The planet  depicted in the artist's illustration below  has a cobalt blue color. It has torrential 4 500-mile-per-hour winds that are so hot they melt silicates into raindrops of molten glass. And that's where the cobalt-blue hue comes from  not oceans. The glass droplets scatter blue light more readily than green or red light.  The planet's color provides unique clues to the atmosphere and weather on a truly alien world that orbits much closer to its star than the innermost planet Mercury is to our Sun.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2013/26/, HER, photo

Latest News: What looks like a celestial hummingbird is really the result of a collision between a spiral and an elliptical galaxy 326 million light- years away. The flat disk of the spiral NGC 2936 is warped into the profile of a bird by the gravitational tug of the companion NGC 2937. The object was first cataloged as a "peculiar galaxy" by Halton Arp in the 1960s. This interacting galaxy duo is collectively called Arp 142.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2013/23/, HER, photo

Nearly 900 extrasolar planets have been confirmed to date  but now for the first time astronomers think they are seeing compelling evidence for a planet under construction in an unlikely place  at a great distance from its diminutive red dwarf star.  Hubble has detected a mysterious gap in a vast protoplanetary disk of gas and dust swirling around the nearby star TW Hydrae  located 176 light-years away in the constellation Hydra. The gap is best explained by the unseen presence of a growing planet that is gravitationally sweeping up material and carving out a lane in the disk  like a snow plow.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2013/20/, HER, photo

Latest News: Hubble can track stellar motions to razor-sharp precision. The nearest star to our Sun  Proxima Centauri  is one of the fastest moving across the sky. Hubble astronomers have found that it will pass in front of two far-more distant background stars  once in 2014 and again in 2016. This will afford a very rare opportunity to see how Proxima's gravity warps the image of the background stars by bending their light. This effect  called gravitational lensing  can be used to estimate Proxima Centauri's mass and establish the presence of any planets orbiting the star.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2013/22/, HER, photo

Picture Post: This image is from a seven-day-long survey conducted in 2006 called the Sagittarius Window Eclipsing Extrasolar Planet Search (SWEEPS). Hubble peered at and obtained information for 180 000 stars in the crowded central bulge of our galaxy  26 000 light-years away. The survey was intended to find hot Jupiter-class planets that orbit very close to their stars. But the SWEEPS team also uncovered 42 oddball blue stars among the bulge population with brightness and temperatures typical for stars much younger than ordinary bulge stars.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/star/2011/16/, HER, photo

Latest News: New observations by #Hubble reveal a new twist on the Ring Nebula. The images show a more complex structure than astronomers once thought.  "The nebula is not like a bagel  but rather  it's like a jelly doughnut  because it's filled with material in the middle " said C. Robert O'Dell of Vanderbilt University in Nashville  Tenn. "With Hubble's detail  we see a completely different shape than what's been thought about historically for this classic nebula. The new Hubble observations show the nebula in much clearer detail  and we see things are not as simple as we previously thought."  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2013/13/, HER, photo

Picture Post: These Hubble snapshots capture merging galaxies at various stages in their collision. Astronomers estimate that only one out of one thousand galaxies in the nearby universe is in the act of colliding. However  galaxy mergers were much more common long ago when they were closer together  because the expanding universe was smaller.   For all their violence  galactic smash-ups take place at a glacial rate by human standards - timescales on the order of several hundred million years.   http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2008/16/, HER, photo

Picture Post: An eerie pillar of star birth in the Carina Nebula rises from a sea of greenish-colored clouds. Nestled inside this dense structure are fledgling stars. They cannot be seen in this image because they are hidden by a wall of gas and dust. Although the stars themselves are invisible  one of them is providing evidence of its existence. Thin puffs of material can be seen traveling to the left and to the right of a dark notch in the center of the pillar. The matter is part of a jet produced by a young star. Farther away  on the left  the jet is visible as a grouping of small  wispy clouds. A few small clouds are visible at a similar distance on the right side of the jet. Astronomers estimate that the jet is moving at speeds of up to 850 000 miles an hour. The jet's total length is about 10 light-years.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/solar%20system/2009/25/image/h/, HER, photo

Billions of years ago  shortly after the Big Bang  the universe was a dark place full of cold hydrogen gas. One of the mysteries of astronomy is what happened to change that  to warm and “reionize” the hydrogen and turn the universe once again transparent to light  blazing with stars and galaxies.  Hubble astronomers may have found some of the culprits  seven primitive galaxies that formed over 13 billion years ago. The galaxies are part of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field image and demonstrate that galaxies may have assembled continuously over time  and may have provided enough radiation to reionize the universe.

Welcome to a Week of Hubble Art on Facebook. Each day we're posting an artist's illustration that depicts a discovery from one of Hubble's news releases. Enjoy!  This artist's illustration shows a dramatic close-up of the scorched extrasolar planet HD 209458b in its orbit only 4 million miles from its yellow  Sun-like star.   The planet's outer atmosphere is extended and heated so much by the searing heat from the nearby star that it starts to escape the planet's gravity. This huge envelope of evaporating hydrogen (shown in blue) resembles a comet with a tail trailing behind the planet. Much of the planet may eventually disappear  leaving only a dense core.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2003/08/, HER, photo

Welcome to a Week of Hubble Art on Facebook. Each day we're posting an artist's illustration that depicts a discovery from one of Hubble's news releases. Enjoy!  This planet  estimated to be at least seven times Jupiter's mass  was originally discovered in images taken with the Keck and Gemini North telescopes in 2007 and 2008. It is the outermost of three massive planets known to orbit the dusty young star HR 8799  which is 130 light-years away. Astronomers combing though years of archived Hubble data were able to identify this planet  which went undiscovered in Hubble images taken in 1998.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2009/15/full/, HER, photo
The giant elliptical galaxy in the center of this image is the most massive and brightest member of the galaxy cluster Abell 2261.  Spanning a little more than one million light-years  the galaxy is about 10 times the diameter of our Milky Way galaxy. The bloated galaxy is a member of an unusual class of galaxies with a diffuse core filled with a fog of starlight. Normally  astronomers would expect to see a concentrated peak of light around a central black hole. Hubble observations revealed that the galaxy's puffy core  measuring about 10 000 light-years  is the largest yet seen.  The observations present a mystery  and studies of this galaxy may provide insight into how black hole behavior may shape the cores of galaxies.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2012/24/full/, HER, photo

The bending of light by a lens or by the atmosphere is an example of refraction  and is due to the change of the speed of light as it moves from one medium to another  such as from air to glass  or through air which is gradually changing in density. This behavior is an example of "the principle of least action " or in the special case of light  "the principle of least time " which means that the path taken by a ray of light is the path that can be traversed in the least time. http://hte.si.edu/light.html  #HTEscience, LER, photo

This #ThrowbackThursday is for all of you Trekkies out there! Pictured here are Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry and some of the principle television cast in front of the Space Shuttle Enterprise at the dedication ceremony on September 17th  1976.  Enterprise was originally planned to be named Constitution and unveiled on Constitution Day (September 17th). However  a letter-writing campaign by Trekkies to the White House changed that when they asked that the orbiter be named after the Starship Enterprise  featured on the television show Star Trek.   Although the Enterprise never flew in space  it was used to test critical phases of landing and other aspects of shuttle preparations. The shuttle was mounted on top of a modified 747 airliner and released over the dry lakebed at Edwards Air Force Base  California to prove it could glide and land safely.

We lost contact with STEREO-B (Solar and Terrestrial Relations Observatory) in October 2014. Read about our plan to get it back:  The two #STEREO #spacecraft  launched in October 2006  were originally designed to complete a two-year mission  ending in 2008. But—like many #NASA spacecraft—they lasted much longer. The long lives of the two STEREO spacecraft  now nine years old  have been a boon for scientists studying the sun and its influence throughout the solar system.   The two STEREOs slowly drifted away from Earth as they orbited the sun  one ahead and one behind our home planet  giving scientists constantly-improving views of the sun’s far side  allowing us for the first time to see the whole sun at once.

Macquarie’s Big History Institute offers a different perspective - featuring StarTalk friend and guest host David Grinspoon  A three-day conference at Macquarie University will thrash out #Earth’s latest existential crisis by looking at it from a variety of disciplinary angles — including quantum physics  economics and planetary science — and taking a big history perspective.  The gathering  staged by Macquarie’s Big History Institute  will consider the #Anthropocene — an increasingly popular term for the human-dominated geological epoch — and its struggles with climate change  health and population.  “We teach #history of the #universe ” says the institute’s director  David Christian. “You might think humans simply vanish on that scale. In one sense they do — we’re a recent species on an obscure planet around a very average #star.  “But this story helps you understand how the universe got more and more complex  and what (makes) us humans behave as no species has acted in four billion years. This is a very odd moment  and you cannot really appreciate how odd until you pan right back and place today’s world in this much larger context of a science-based universal history.”  US astrobiologist David Grinspoon  who addresses the conference on Friday  suspects #alien civilisations have faced similar moments. But we’ll never know unless they came out the other side.  If they didn’t  their signature in the cosmic record will have been too fleeting for us to notice. “If we become aware of their presence  they will have been doing this thing we’re attempting to do — living with planet-changing technology — much longer than we have ” he says.  Success will have made them virtually immortal  harnessing their technological capabilities to survive meteor strikes or control the climate to their advantage. “If (alien civilisations) achieved a mature relationship with technology  they should be out there.”  Christian says big history can help humans achieve the same goal  or survive climate change at any rate. “It’s very hard to get an overview of large complex problems that cut across disciplines ” he says.  “But all the big problems of the Anthropocene are exactly like that. You have to understand some economics  some chemistry  some geology to begin to get your brain around them. I don’t think you can understand it just within history or even just within ecology. You need to see how all these disciplines link together.”  Article from The Australian (Photo credit: John Ross) #astrobiology, LER, photo

Project StarGazer: Dec. 13 –14  1962  An early balloon-borne project to carry out astronomical studies at very high altitude. It involved only one flight. On Dec. 13–14  1962  Joseph Kittinger and William White  an #astronomer  flew a gondola suspended beneath an 85-meter-diameter Mylar #balloon to a height of 25 000 m over New Mexico. In addition to obtaining telescopic observations from above 95% of Earth's atmosphere  the flight provided valuable data for the development of pressure suits and associated life support systems during a 13-hour stay at the edge of space.  The balloon that supported the Stargazer capsule was a 280-foot diameter sphere of Mylar film; however  at launch only a comparatively small bubble of helium gas occupied the top of the balloon with the remainder of the balloon envelope dangling beneath. As the balloon rose  the gas expanded  filling the balloon until at maximum altitude  it was completely filled and reshaped the envelope into a sphere. The gondola was supported below the balloon on a cable giving a total height at takeoff of approximately 400 feet.  via The Worlds of David Darling  (Images attributed to: www.daviddarling.info and Jack Gruber/USA Today), LER, photo

Star Wars fans will be familiar with the planet #Tatooine and its two suns. But as it turns out the majority of stars in the Milky Way #galaxy live with a companion. And that’s led scientists to study how multiple star systems form and develop  and whether they can host habitable planets.  To help us understand the behaviour of binary star systems and the even more fascinating domain of supermassive binary black holes  the results of merging galaxies  Canadian podcast The Star Spot is joined by Pawel Artymowicz.  http://starspotpodcast.com/2015/11/02/twos-company-from-binary-stars-to-binary-supermassive-black-holes-pawel-artymowicz/, LER, link

Saturn’s main rings  seen here on their ''lit'' face  appear much darker than normal. That’s because they tend to scatter light back toward its source — in this case  the Sun.  More info about thi image here: http://go.nasa.gov/13ryvVv, HER, photo

Tethys peeks out from behind Rhea  bright from a dusting of clean E-ring ice. Scientists believe that Tethys' surprisingly high albedo is due to the water ice jets emerging from its neighbor  Enceladus. The fresh water ice becomes the E ring and can eventually arrive at Tethys. Read more: http://go.nasa.gov/12WVNTk, HER, photo
These new maps are the best global  color maps of these Saturnian moons to date  and the first to show natural brightness variations and high-resolution color together.

In this picture  we can glimpse the shadow of the rings on the planet through (and below) the translucent A and C rings. Look towards the lower right hand corner.  It was only in 1857 when the physicist James Clerk Maxwell demonstrated that the rings must be composed of many small particles and not solid rings around the planet. More info: http://go.nasa.gov/1yZZIdh, HER, photo
Enceladus (visible in the lower-left corner of the image) is but a speck before enormous Saturn.  The presence of jets from Enceladus has been the subject of intense study since they were discovered by Cassini.  Read more about it here: go.nasa.gov/1yaKB2J, HER, photo
A bit of beauty Monday:  Shadows of edge-on rings & ringlets are delicately recorded across Saturn's face. Can you spot Tethys (the large bright body near the lower right hand corner of this image) and Mimas (seen as a slight crescent against Saturn's disk above the rings  at about 4 o'clock). Try the full resolution here if you can't spot tiny Mimas: go.nasa.gov/1AHFfNl, HER, photo
Does this image look like paint swirled on an artists palette?  The tops of Saturn's uppermost cloud layers are the result of fluid dynamics.

Jupiter's Red Spot is Likely a Sunburn  Not a Blush. News release here  http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4372  The results were presented Nov 14 by Kevin Baines  a Cassini team scientist based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory  Pasadena  California  at the American Astronomical Society's Division for Planetary Science Meeting in Tucson  Arizona. #DPS12 , HER, photo
A new day dawns on Saturn as the north pole of Saturn emerges into the Sun's light. The image was taken with the wide-angle camera on Aug. 23  2014 using a spectral filter which preferentially admits wavelengths of near-infrared light centered at 939 nanometers.   More about it here: http://go.nasa.gov/1xdHHd0 #DPS14, HER, photo
High-phase observations -- taken looking generally toward the Sun  as in this image -- are very powerful scientifically since the way atmospheres and rings transmit sunlight is often diagnostic of compositions and physical states. Titan's crescent nearly encircles its disk due to the small haze particles high in its atmosphere refracting the incoming light of the distant Sun. Read more http://go.nasa.gov/1vCCWUB, HER, photo
This near-infrared  color mosaic shows the sun glinting off of Titan's north polar seas. While Cassini has captured  separately  views of the polar seas (see PIA17470) and the sun glinting off of them (see PIA12481 and PIA18433) in the past  this is the first time both have been seen together in the same view.

This week's new image features tiny Pandora and Atlas. Pandora and Prometheus (not shown) interact frequently with the narrow F ring  producing channels and streamers and other interesting features. Atlas is 19 miles  or 30 kilometers across  and Pandora is 50 miles  or 81 kilometers across.  The two rings shown are the F Ring and the A ring  separated by the Roche Division. Atlas orbits between the two rings.  Read more here: http://go.nasa.gov/1vE3p7X, HER, photo

Measurements made by several of Cassini's instruments during a close encounter with Hyperion on September 26  2005  indicate that something unexpected took place in the charged particle environment around the spacecraft. Among those instruments  the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) detected that the spacecraft was magnetically connected to the surface of Hyperion for a brief period  allowing electrons to escape from the moon toward the robotic probe.

Pan maintains the Encke Gap in Saturn's A ring by gravitationally nudging the ring particles back into the rings when they stray. Scientists think similar processes might be at work as forming planets clear gaps in the circumstellar disks from which they form.   More Info: http://go.nasa.gov/1q8yxLE, HER, photo
New image!  Bright Mimas is positioned against the shadow of Saturn's rings in this image. As we near summer in Saturn's northern hemisphere  the rings cast ever larger shadows on the planet.  With a reflectivity of about 96 percent  Mimas (246 miles  or 396 kilometers across) appears bright against the less-reflective Saturn.  More about this image here: http://go.nasa.gov/1r1LzG9, HER, photo
New image of the week: Encke gap in Saturn's A ring has three ringlets threaded through it  two of which are visible in this image.

Saturn appears to Cassini's cameras as a thin  sunlit crescent in this unearthly view. Parts of the night side of Saturn show faint illumination due to light reflected off the rings back onto the planet  an effect dubbed "ringshine."

Titan's building blocks might pre-date Saturn. Nitrogen in the atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan originated in conditions similar to the cold birthplace of the most ancient comets from the Oort cloud. The main implication of this new research is that Titan's building blocks formed early in the solar system's history  in the cold disk of gas and dust that formed the sun.

Here's a view toward the sunlit side of the rings revealing Atlas emerging from Saturn's shadow.   Wondering about the bright spot in the ring? Is it a jet or a clump?  We asked Cassini scientist Dr. Carl Murray  who replied "I would classify it as a "mini-jet" rather than an example of a "jet" that we sometimes see. They are both the product of collisions of small objects with the core of the F ring. These small objects orbit close to the core and occasionally collide with it. If the relative velocity is large enough then a larger "jet" is produced.  In this image the original "mini-jet" has sheared quite a bit -- if you look closely and change the contrast you can see a faint continuation of the "mini-jet" almost parallel to the core.  This much shear means that the collision probably happened a few days before the image was taken."  Thanks Dr. Carl Murray for the great answer!

Happy birthday Giovanni Domenico Cassini  born on this day  June 8  1625 in the comune of Perinaldo in the Most Serene Republic of Genoa  now part of Italy.  Cassini discovered four moons of Saturn - Iapetus (1671)  Rhea (1672)  Tethys (1684)  and Dione (1684). In 1675  he discovered that Saturn's rings are separated into two parts by a gap  which is now called Cassini Division in his honor.  He also was the first director of the Paris Observatory  measured the sun's apparent motion through the sky  and even approximated the distance from the Earth to the Sun. In addition  he used the shadows of Jupiter's moons and shadows on Jupiter's surface to determine the length of Jupiter's day  and he is also credited with discovering Jupiter's Great Red Spot!, HER, photo
NASA Ames Research Center scientists working with Cassini data have developed a new way to understand the atmospheres of exoplanets by using smog-enshrouded Titan as a stand-in.  "It turns out there's a lot you can learn from looking at a sunset " said Tyler Robinson  a NASA Postdoctoral Research Fellow at NASA's Ames Research Center.  Light from sunsets  stars and planets can be separated into its component colors to create spectra  as prisms do with sunlight  in order to obtain hidden information.

Another first! Another pale blue dot. Cassini's first-ever image of the pale blue ice-giant planet Uranus in the distance beyond Saturn's rings. (upper left of photo)  The robotic spacecraft briefly turned its gaze away from the ringed beauty of Saturn on April 11  2014  to observe the distant planet  which is the seventh planet from the sun.  This view was acquired by the Cassini narrow-angle camera at a distance of approximately 614 300 miles (988 600 kilometers) from Saturn on April 11  2014. Image scale at Uranus is approximately 16 000 miles (25 700 kilometers) per pixel. Image scale at Saturn's rings is approximately 4 miles (6 kilometers) per pixel. In the image  the disk of Uranus is just barely resolved. The solar phase angle at Uranus  seen from Cassini  is 11.9 degrees.  In addition to its aesthetic appeal  Cassini's view of Uranus also serves a practical purpose. Scientists working on several of Cassini's science investigations expect that they will be able to use images and spectra from these observations to help calibrate their own instruments., HER, photo

Strong new evidence that Saturn's moon Enceladus harbors a large underground ocean of liquid water  furthering scientific interest in the moon as a potential home to extraterrestrial microbes!  News release from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL): http://1.usa.gov/1mEK28w, HER, photo
Vortex and Rings image taken April 2  2014 using a spectral filter which preferentially admits wavelengths of near-infrared light centered at 752 nanometers. Three magnificent sights at once: Saturn's north polar vortex and hexagon along with its expansive rings. The hexagon  wider than two Earths  owes its appearance to the jet stream that forms its perimeter. The jet stream forms a six-lobed  stationary wave which wraps around the north polar regions at a latitude of roughly 77 degrees North.

It is not certain that this interaction will end in a collision and ultimately a merging of the two galaxies  although the galaxies have already been affected. Together known as Arp 271  this dance will last for tens of millions of years  creating new stars as a result of the mutual gravitational attraction between the galaxies  a pull seen in the bridge of stars already connecting the two.

These are some raw images obtained simultaneously by the three detectors of the X-shooter instrument on the VLT. The light of a celestial object  in this case a quasar  is dispersed according to its wavelength or colour  to form a very long  very high resolution spectrum covering the full wavelength range from ultraviolet to infrared. The optical elements in the spectrograph arrange this long spectrum in a series of consecutive  shorter spectra  called orders. http://www.eso.org/public/images/xshooter_cc/ Image credit: ESO Astronomy, HER, photo

Now You See It  Now You Don't  Now You Do Again  In the early morning hours  the arrival of the winter solstice was marked by a total lunar eclipse lasting three hours  28 minutes. Photographer Sean Smith recorded how it looked over NASA's Langley Research Center.  The last time a total lunar eclipse and the winter solstice coincided and was seen over this part of Virginia  the area was still being settled  nearby Jamestown was recovering from the starving time and the first buildings of Williamsburg were under construction.  It was Dec. 21  1638  The next time a similar occurrance can be seen over North America will be Dec. 21  2094.  A total lunar eclipse occurs when Earth aligns directly between the sun and moon  blocking the suns rays and casting a shadow over the moon. As it moves deeper into the Earth's shadow  the full moon changes color  from gray to orange or deep red. In this case  the moon was in complete shadow for 72 minutes., HER, photo

The Perseids are Back! Wish upon a star... dozens of times a night! Heading out to cottage country or camping? Be sure to look for the Perseids  one of the most impressive annual meteor showers! Each year  from late July to mid-August  hundreds of meteors rain down on our skies as the Earth passes through the tail of Comet Swift-Tuttle. An increasing number of shooting stars should be visible every night  until the light show culminates August 12-13. During the peak  typically in the darkest hours after midnight  up to 50 to 80 meteors per hour can streak across the sky.  Here are a few tips for meteor hunting: •If possible  head away from city lights  which make it hard to see fainter meteors. To increase your chances of seeing shooting stars  set out in search of dark skies in the countryside.  • Dress warmly. Even though the Perseids occur in the summertime  it is still a good idea to bring warm (even winter) clothes. August nights can be very chilly. • Sit back and relax on a reclining chair or lie down on a blanket. Not only is it much more comfortable to observe the stars lying down  but you'll also see more that way. • Pack a thermos of hot chocolate or coffee—it will come in handy if you start to drift off or get a little chilly!  • If you need to use a flashlight  place a red filter over the bulb (a red balloon will do in a bind). White light is very blinding and may affect your night vision. • Be patient. It might take a while before you see your first shooting star. Don't be quick to give up... It's worth the wait!  And don't forget to make a wish! Photo: Perseids below! Astronaut Ron Garan snapped this shot of a Perseid meteor (the white streak) below the International Space Station (ISS) on August 13  2011.

Postcards from a Comet Steep cliffs  boulders  plains and rocky terrain. These features could be from many places on Earth  but you are actually looking at the surface of a comet. The image was taken from the European Space Agency’s Rosetta spacecraft  which successfully entered into orbit around Comet 67P early this morning after a 10-year trek across the solar system into deep space (more than five times Earth’s distance from the Sun). The spacecraft will continue its cosmic dance around the comet  beaming back imagery and data to find out what the comet is made of. Rosetta will also scout out a landing area and  in November  will lower a probe called Philae down onto the comet’s surface.

Today  the CSA hosted students from the International Space University’s Space Sciences Department to execute an analogue rover mission. On Monday  the students were introduced to planetary science and in-situ resource utilization  and developed a science exploration plan for the mission. They had to decide which instruments to configure on the rover  the route to take  science targets  contingencies and all other aspects of the mission.  The premise of the exercise was that a crew travelling to Mars (the students) had to control a rover on Mars to determine the best landing site for their capsule with the help of a ground team (the instructors who were in a separate room). Communications delays added to the challenge. The objective was to provide an opportunity for ISU students to participate in the definition  planning  and execution of a realistic robotic planetary exploration mission.  This activity was proposed and organized by Neptec  a Canadian space company  and Planetary Scientists Melissa Battler and Mary Kerrigan of Western University’s Centre for Planetary Science and Exploration with the support of the CSA. CSA astronaut David Saint-Jacques was also on hand both days to coach the students and support the instructors., HER, photo

University students from across Canada – and from Bologna  Italy – spent the last three days at CSA's David Florida Laboratory to take part in the final phase of the Canadian Satellite Design Challenge (CSDC) – the launch environmental testing of the their “cubesat” satellites.  The satellites were submitted to vibration testing  which simulates the vibration experienced during launch. Afterwards  each team then has to perform a functional test of their satellite  to demonstrate that it survived the testing in full working order.  In this second offering of the CSDC  teams from five universities – Victoria  Manitoba  Waterloo  Concordia  and a combined team from the École Polytechnique de Montréal and the University of Bologna – tested their completed cubesat satellites.   The CSDC is a Canada-wide competition for university students to design and build a small operational research satellite. The ultimate goal of this competition is to launch the winning "cubesats" into orbit in order to conduct science research.   The CSDC objectives are to enhance space-related knowledge and capacity at Canadian universities; increase academia-industry co-operation in space-related research and development  and expose participants to the management processes of a large engineering project. The winning team will be announced tonight. Good luck!  Written with content by Geocentrix.ca., HER, photo

How do we drive Dextre and fly Canadarm2?  Justin Cuplinkas asked us for details on how Canadarm2 and Dextre are operated. Here's the answer from Ed Birchnall  flight controller at the CSA and part of the team that trains flight controllers and astronauts in robotics:   Canadarm2 and Dextre were designed to be operated the same way and there are several different options available. There are two joysticks (or hand-controllers as we call them) at the robotics workstation on the International Space Station. If an astronaut were to fly one of the arms in what we call manual mode  they would use both hand controllers to drive the Canadarm2. The translational hand controller can move the tip (or another point we decide on) up  down  left  right  in and out. The rotational hand-controller can make the robotic arm rotate in pitch  yaw and roll. This is how the astronauts drive Canadarm2 to capture a visiting vehicle like the SpaceX Dragon that is docked right now  or to move an astronaut around on the end of Candarm2 during a spacewalk.  The hand-controllers can also be used to drive the arm one joint at a time or to swing the "elbow" of the arm. Imagine holding on to a door knob and without moving your hand  rotating your elbow.   We can also drive the arms without hand controllers  which is the way it is controlled by the ground at Johnson Space Center and here at the CSA by the mission control team.  We call these "automatic sequences."  We can pick a set of coordinates around the space station where we want the tip of the arm to be and tell it to go there. We can also tell all seven joints which position to go to and they will all drive at the same time to get to their final positions at the same time.  This is our most common way of operating which allows us to do some of the really complex motions of Candarm2 and Dextre.    The same hand-controllers can be used to operate both Canadarm2 and Dextre but they can only drive one arm at a time. Today  the hand..., HER, photo

Today on the International Space Station  Dextre became the first space robot to repair its own system when he removed a faulty camera located on Canadarm2's elbow and relocated it to the mobile base (together  Dextre  Canadarm2 and the mobile base form the Mobile Servicing System  Canada's robotic contribution to the space station).  It took two tries to remove the camera from its mounting on Canadarm2  likely because cold metal tends to be a bit sticky. But Dextre got it out on the third try with a bit of jiggling...and some elbow grease!  The first of two cameras that Dextre will replace in the coming days  this camera produced hazy images--like looking through a foggy window. While it may not be clear enough to help guide Canadarm2's movements  it will be sufficient for providing images from its new location on the mobile base. At the end of the day  Canadarm2 moved Dextre into a park position for the next operations on Tuesday  when Dextre will retrieve a second camera from the Japanese module’s airlock—the first time this has ever been attempted--and place it on the empty slot on Canadarm2's elbow.

Did you find the answer to the question in our previous post? No? Well this "rod" is actually one of eight 1-meter long superbolts that secured the folded Canadarm2 in its launch cradle (the Spacelab Pallet  seen in the photo). CSA astronaut Chris Hadfield and NASA's Scott Parazynski removed the eight bolts before unfolding the arm and installing it on the space station in April 2001. One of these bolts is now on display at our headquarters.    The same pallet was used in 2008 to launch Canada's robotic handyman Dextre., HER, photo

NASA Astronauts Steve Swanson and Rick Mastracchio (wearing the suit with the red stripes) successfully completed a 1.5 hour spacewalk to replace a failed back up computer (MDM) this morning. The MDM is one of two computers that provide telemetry and command for various external systems  including the Mobile Transporter that carries Dextre and Canadarm2.   CSA Astronaut Jeremy Hansen did a great job as Ground IV  guiding the spacewalkers through procedures from NASA's Mission Control Center in Houston  Texas. It was the first time that a Canadian played this important role from the ground. Jeremy can be seen top left on the second picture.  An all-Canadian robotics team (ROBO) was also on console at CSA to configure Dextre's cameras to watch part of the spacewalk.   The spacewalk went quickly and smoothly and Swanson was even able to perform a get-ahead task by cutting a dangling lanyard that prevented Dextre from finishing a demo task last June. This 179th spacewalk in support of the assembly and maintenance of the ISS was Mastracchio's 9th spacewalk and Swanson's 5th.

A Canadian First! CSA Astronaut Jeremy Hansen will have a front row seat during next week’s contingency spacewalk to replace a failed backup computer on the International Space Station (ISS). Sitting by the Capcom at NASA’s Mission Control Center  he will be acting as Ground IV  or Intravehicular crewmember  supporting NASA’s Rick Mastracchio and Steve Swanson and helping them with procedures during the spacewalk.   While Marc Garneau  Julie Payette and Chris Hadfield have acted as IV in the past from inside the ISS  it will be the first time a Canadian astronaut is trusted with the role of “spacewalk choreographer” from the ground.  The 2 5-hour spacewalk is set for Wednesday  April 23  unless SpaceX scrubs its launch attempt today  in which case the excursion will move up earlier to Easter Sunday  April 20. In preparation for the spacewalk  Jeremy took part in countless team meetings this week to plan  develop procedures and anticipate everything that could go wrong.

Welding in space?  David (@Ri_kiri) sent us the following question via the CSA's Twitter account (@csa_asc):  "Is welding possible in space? I'm assuming it would be too great a safety risk to do outside of robotics." Here's the answer from Marie-Josée Potvin  CSA engineer in structural dynamics: "We can't weld the way we do on Earth because the heat doesn't dissipate the same way  since there is no air to cool down a surface. In other situations  if a hot surface is exposed to deep space  it would lose its heat much faster than on Earth.  However  welding can happen in other fashions.  When two pieces made of the same material are in contact in a vacuum (such as in space)  the atoms will migrate and the two pieces of material will actually stick together. Some theories predict that that lunar dust submitted to microwaves could melt and become solid. Other methods of welding using a narrow heat distribution  such as with a laser  might also be possible.", HER, status

Today is #WorldCancerDay.  Space is a hazardous environment to live and work in  especially when it comes to radiation. Originating from violent storms on the Sun and galactic cosmic rays  this natural radiation can pose a serious health risk for astronauts on long-duration space missions like those on the International Space Station where radiation levels are hundreds of times higher than the levels on Earth.  The CSA's support of radiation research will not only lead to major advancements for future human exploration of space  but also in our knowledge of the health risks of radiation  such as cancer  neurological damage and degenerative tissue disease. Radi-N2 and its predecessor Radi-N  as well as EVARM are examples of Canadian science experiments on space radiation:  Radi-N2  performed by Chris Hadfield (as seen on the photo): http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/sciences/radi-n2.asp  EVARM: http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/iss/evarm.asp, HER, photo

MEDIA: Statement by the President of the Canadian Space Agency on the 15th Anniversary of the International Space Station "Fifteen years ago today  Canada became one of the five partners in the most complex scientific and technological endeavours ever undertaken—the International Space Station. The launch of the first element of the space station—a Russian module appropriately named "Zarya " or "dawn"— on November 20  1998 marked the beginning of a new international collaboration that demonstrates daily how countries can work together to achieve peaceful objectives.  The cutting-edge science conducted aboard this unique orbiting science lab touches a variety of fields of research vital to life on Earth: ageing  cardiology  neurology  materials science  and learning the effects of radiation on the human body.  Canadian ingenuity literally built the space station with Canadarm2. Our talented engineers developed cutting-edge technology critical to the station's daily operations. Today  Dextre  the station's resident robotic "handyman" conducts routine maintenance jobs that frees up crew time for science. Canadian astronauts have travelled to  worked on and commanded the orbiting laboratory in eight separate missions. And countless future Canadian space scientists and engineers—and the next-generation of Canadian astronauts—have been inspired by seeing our country's achievements.  On behalf of the Canadian Space Agency  I congratulate all the women and men around the globe that are part of this monumental accomplishment for our collective future."  http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/media/news_releases/2013/1120.asp, HER, photo

The Perseids are Back! Wish upon a star…dozens of times a night! Heading out to cottage country or camping?  Be sure to look for the Perseids  one of the most impressive annual meteor showers! Each year  from late July to mid-August  hundreds of meteors rain down on our skies as the Earth passes through the tail of Comet Swift-Tuttle. An increasing number of shooting stars should be visible every night  until the light show culminates on the nights of August 11-13. During the peak  typically in the darkest hours after midnight  up to 50 to 80 meteors per hour can streak across the sky.  Here are a few tips for meteor hunting: - If possible  head away from city lights  which make it hard to see fainter meteors. To increase your chances of seeing shooting stars  set out in search of dark skies in the countryside.  - Dress warmly. Even though the Perseids occur in the summertime  it is still a good idea to bring warm (even winter) clothes. August nights can be very chilly. - Sit back and relax on a reclining chair or lie down on a blanket. Not only is it much more comfortable to observe the stars lying down  but you’ll also see more that way. - Pack a thermos of hot chocolate or coffee—it will come in handy if you start to drift off or get a little chilly!  - If you need to use a flashlight  place a red filter over the bulb (a red balloon will do in a bind). White light is very blinding and may affect your night vision. - Be patient. It might take a while before you see your first shooting star. Don’t be quick to give up... It’s worth the wait.  And don’t forget to make a wish! Photo: Perseids below! Astronaut Ron Garan snapped this shot of a Perseid meteor (the white streak) below the International Space Station on August 13  2011.

Space in a Suitcase: Astronaut Jeremy Hansen’s Roving Mission! Today  Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen will remotely pilot a prototype of a lunar rover at the Canadian Space Agency’s analogue terrain to kick off the “Space in a Suitcase” technology demonstration. The goal of the project is to determine the best  most intuitive ways for an astronaut to command a helper rover from a base on the surface of the Moon. As its name hints  Space in a Suitcase is a portable rover command kit that will enable Jeremy to operate any of the CSA’s rovers from anywhere in the world. Using on-board cameras and data  he’ll guide the rover through a series of obstacles with a slight communications delay (varying between 1-3 seconds) and very limited bandwidth (try 100 kbps!) to simulate the real-time communications challenges between the Earth and the Moon.  And  to make the simulation even more realistic  we won’t even let him peek at the terrain until his mission is complete! Stay tuned this week for updates and photos of Jeremy’s newest mission!

How Chris Hadfield Exercises Back to Health by Natalie Hirsch  Canadian Space Agency Exercise Specialist  Most of the muscles that control posture on earth go on vacation for the duration of a space mission  except during 2 hours of in-flight exercise per day  and upon return to earth need to work every waking minute to support the body.  These conditions leave astronauts feeling fatigued  stiff  sore and unstable upon return to earth. (Consider that astronauts do not sit down while in space so even their tailbones hurt while they get used to sitting again on Earth.)   Fortunately  our bodies are amazing machines that continually adapt to our surroundings and the discomfort experienced upon return to earth is temporary and part of the normal response of a healthy human body getting used to a significantly different environment.  The time to adapt to a new environment varies between astronauts: genetics  fitness  age  duration in space  exercise in space and upon return to earth can all play a role in how long it takes to return to being a healthy & fit earthling.  The overall goal of the post-flight reconditioning program is to assist an astronaut in returning to his pre-flight physical fitness - ensuring that he (or she) is just as sprightly after a stint in microgravity as he was before launch. This includes making sure his balance  agility  muscular endurance  strength and power  flexibility  cardiovascular fitness and bone density are similar to when he left earth.  Reconditioning:  Week 1 The first week of reconditioning included a movement assessment to identify how the returning astronaut performs basic movements (balancing  stepping  squatting  and lunging) and exercises to practice these movements.   The focus of the first few days of reconditioning was on balance  coordination and locomotion - getting used to controlling body in gravity - and cardiovascular fitness.

Fourth update on Chris Hadfield’s condition   by Raffi Kuyumjian  CSA’s Chief Medical Officer and Hadfield’s Flight Surgeon  The weekend schedule will allow Chris some "active rest". His walk continues to improve despite some lingering dizziness and soreness in his back muscles  which are slowly getting used to working again in keeping the back straight and upright against gravity after 5 months of complete rest... Somewhat similar to having spent 24/7 in bed without moving for 5 months and then suddenly having to get up and walk!  Today a session of science data collection on Manual Control testing for coordination and reaction times using a motion flight simulator and car simulator amongst others: showing clear signs of improvement compared to 3 days ago when he completed the same tests! After the usual 2-hour daily reconditioning session  a few interview sessions will complete the day for Chris.    Photo: Manual Control testing using a Motion Flight Simulator. May 18  2013.

Choice quotes from Col. Chris Hadfield during his news conference (paraphrased):  "On the ISS  when you have 30 seconds free  you go do something else!"  "It's a whole new normal  my body was perfectly happy living in space... My body is catching up with the change."  "We're learning about the fundamental nature of matter because the ISS exists."  "People followed me because there is poetry and purpose in what is happening on the ISS."  "I'm not a person who looks back and wishes that my past was my present."  "In the gym yesterday  it felt like someone was squeezing me down into the floor  felt like it was so unfair!"  "Zero gravity is like a superpower!"  "We are working hard to make the most out of the taxpayer's dollar and make the ISS a fabric of the lives of Canadians."   "I don't have a callouses on the bottom of my feet yet  I'm walking around like an infant."  "CSA's Microflow tested to show how space tech can help remote communities with things like blood testing."  "We're also inspiring our youth to do something that barely seems possible."  On his landing: "We could smell spring  the charred spacecraft  growing grass wafting through the open door."  "In 2001  ISS was barely functional  only 1 lab  it was just getting going. The reason we put Canadarm2 on was to build ISS."  "The number of people following is a measure of the number of people who shared the experience."  "My advice: turn yourself into what you want to become step by step as a demonstration of personal will."  On his favourite photo he took in space: "Most proud of the pic of the Sun over Indian ocean  noctilucent clouds  revealing how our upper atmosphere works.", HER, status

International Space Station Update   Following Thursday's identification of an ammonia coolant leak outside the International Space Station (ISS)  the Expedition 35 crew Friday began preparing for a possible spacewalk Saturday. Mission managers are discussing the information that was gathered overnight about the leak on the far left-side of the station's truss structure  called the P6 with P standing for port. A final decision on whether to go forward with a spacewalk is not expected until late tonight.  The crew is not in danger  and the station continues to operate normally otherwise. Work is under way to reroute power channels to maintain full operation of the systems normally controlled by the solar array that is cooled by the suspect loop. Expedition 35's Chris Cassidy and Tom Marshburn began preparing for the possible spacewalk to inspect the area it appears the leak is originating from  and potentially make repairs to the leaking ammonia cooling loop. Station managers are meeting this morning and will meet again tonight to discuss procedures and timeline work for a spacewalk  if approved.  Working in the Quest airlock  astronauts Cassidy and Marshburn checked out the U.S. spacesuits they would wear if a spacewalk is approved  and Expedition 35 Commander Chris Hadfield began preparing to assist as the “intravehicular” crewmember  or spacewalk choreographer. Cassidy and Marshburn have each conducted three spacewalks  all on the STS-127 mission to the ISS in 2009. They collaborated on two of those spacewalks. Late Thursday morning  the Expedition 35 crew reported seeing small white flakes floating away from an area of the station’s P6 truss structure. The crew used handheld cameras and Mission Control used external television cameras to gain additional imagery in an attempt to narrow down the leak’s location. The crew’s reports  along with imagery and data received by flight controllers in Mission Control in Houston  confirmed that the rate of the ammonia..., HER, link

Days 3 & 4 of the Robotic Refueling Mission  On May 6  robotics ground controllers powered up Dextre and Canadarm2 for the Robotic Refueling Mission (RRM)  a joint NASA-CSA technology demonstration test to show how robots could refuel and service satellites in space—even though they were designed never to be maintained.   Dextre successfully completed his first task  tightening a screw on the RRM module. Torquing screws is a run-of-the-mill job on Earth  but is not so simple for the space station’s robotic handyman: picture Dextre (3.7 metres tall) standing on the end of 17-metre Canadarm2  using a screwdriver that is being guided by a robotics operator on Earth  who relies on video cameras and telemetry data to remove a teensy screw without dropping it. Suddenly  your Saturday home renovation project seems a little simpler  doesn’t it?   Afterwards  Canadarm2 repositioned Dextre to start work on another first for the space robot—the multilayer insulation task  a typical but tricky operation that a robot would do to access satellite components covered by protective thermal blankets. Dextre was instructed to use a blade on the wire-cutting tool to cut a U-shaped hole in a taped seam that seals three sides of a panel of material  fold back the flap  cut a wire underneath and reseal the insulation blanket. Dextre sliced through the first side as planned  but the ultra-thin insulation appeared to rip slightly while cutting the second side. Having reached the end of the time allotted for operations  ground crews opted to break for the day and make use of a planned free day in operations to assess how best to proceed.    With safety as their top priority  robotics and RRM teams determined that it was safe to continue cutting the insulation material. On Day 4  Dextre successfully finished slicing the two remaining taped seams  folding back the flap of material to reveal the wire underneath. Due to time constraints  ground controllers decided not to cut wire  and parked..., HER, photo

Robotic Refueling Mission: Day 2  Dextre worked throughout the night on the Robotics Refueling Mission (RRM)  removing two small caps on the NASA-provided module. The second task of the night  unfastening tiny screws  proceeded slowly but successfully. It took several tries for Dextre to use the safety cap tool to pick up the torque set adapter (i.e. a space screwdriver!)  but the sixth time was a charm! Dextre then used the adapter to remove two screws  the first of which was a test screw enclosed inside a special cage to ensure it could not be dropped. Dextre manipulated both the caged and uncaged screws correctly.  While robots are able to work tirelessly  the human ground control crews will take a break over the weekend! RRM operations will resume on Monday. Stay tuned as Dextre checks off more unprecedented tasks on his job list  including the first time a space robot will manipulate thermal blankets.

The Robotic Refueling Mission (RRM): Day 1  Last night  Dextre was on duty doing precision work for RRM  successfully replacing a safety cap in its receptacle—a typical task that a robot would do if dispatched to repair a failing satellite in space.   On Day 2  operations will continue this afternoon and into the night as Dextre uses his delicate sense of touch to remove tiny screws on the RRM module using custom-built power tools provided by NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. Ever dropped a screw while removing it? Then imagine Dextre  a 3.7-metre tall robot  balancing on the end of Canadarm2 (which is as long as a bus)  unfastening teensy screws that simply must not be dropped. Ground control teams at NASA’s Johnson Space Center  Goddard and the CSA will be working closely together to ensure that operations proceed smoothly in this challenging test for the space station’s resident handyman.

Canadian astronomers reveal surprising new portrait of the Early Universe  Planck space mission sheds light on the Universe's age  evolution and composition Longueuil  Quebec  March 21  2013 – The Planck Space Telescope has produced by far the best map ever made of the most ancient light in the Universe  showing that it is slightly older than previously thought  expanding more slowly and that there is more matter than known before.  Planck includes contributions from the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The CSA funds two Canadian research teams that are part of the Planck science collaboration  and who helped develop both of Planck's complementary science instruments  the High Frequency Instrument (HFI) and the Low Frequency Instrument (LFI). Professors J. Richard Bond of the University of Toronto (Director of Cosmology and Gravity at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research) and Douglas Scott of the University of British Columbia lead the Canadian Planck team  which includes members from the University of Alberta  Université Laval and McGill University.   Canadian astronomers are members of the international team unveiling Planck's results in Paris today. Led by the European Space Agency  the Planck Space Telescope has been surveying the sky since launched in 2009. The telescope's incredible accuracy allows it to pinpoint faint  minute patterns—differences in light and temperature that correspond to slightly different densities in the matter left over from the Big Bang. The data being released today are from the first 15 months of the mission  and show a map of the Universe when it was just 380 000 years old.   Planck's data confirm and refine previous models of how astronomers believe the Universe originated and evolved  but with intriguing new details. The Planck team has calculated that the Universe is 13.82 billion years old—100 million years older than earlier estimates. Planck has revealed that the Universe is expanding significantly slower than the..., HER, photo

News Release: Dextre Successfully Refuels Mock Satellite and Aces a Major Test for Space Robotics  Longueuil  Quebec  January 25  2013 – Dextre  the Canadian Space Agency’s robotic “handyman” on board the International Space Station  made space history last night by successfully refueling a mock satellite on the exterior of the station. Topping off the satellite’s fuel tank was the pivotal task in the experimental Robotic Refueling Mission (RRM)  a collaboration between NASA and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) to demonstrate how robots could service and refuel satellites on location in space to extend their useful lifetime.  For RRM  NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center designed a module simulating a satellite  as well as custom power tools for Dextre. Since RRM operations began in 2011  Dextre has performed three series of tests to show how a robot could service satellites  which were designed never to be opened in space. In this latest set of operations  Dextre removed two safety caps  cut through two sets of thin retaining wires  and finally transferred a small quantity of liquid ethanol into the washing machine-sized module. The latter maneuver was particularly tricky  since handling liquids in space required perfect precision to prevent dangerous leaks. The specialized tools built for the job allowed Dextre to seal the connections between the tool and the fuel valve to eliminate the possibility of leaks. Adding to the level of difficulty was the fuel hose itself  which adds additional forces that tend to pull Dextre’s hands. It took the combined skills of the experienced NASA and CSA robotics controllers to pull off this first-of-a-kind space refueling demonstration successfully and without any mishap.  RRM is a significant step in pioneering robotic technologies and techniques in the field of satellite servicing—saving ailing space hardware by refueling or refurbishing them before they become space debris. The ability to refuel satellites in space could one..., HER, photo

September 1  1969: Telesat gets off the ground   The federal government creates Telesat Canada to own and exploit Canadian communication satellites. Telesat connected Canadians and pioneered “Direct to Home” broadcasting.  Canadians are familiar with the phrase: “Live via satellite.” Before satellites  major events — watching a gold medal winning performance in the Olympics — were first captured on film or videotape and transported between continents to be seen days later in Canada., HER, photo
Meet our Fleet!   In order to prepare Canada for the next steps in the international exploration of space  the CSA has worked in collaboration with over 40 organizations from Canada's space industry and academia to design and build a fleet of terrestrial rovers that will serve as the forerunners of vehicles that may one day serve as proxies for exploring destinations like the Moon or Mars.

Secrets of the Starry Summer Night - What to see this August   • The Perseid Meteor Showers: Each year  the Earth passes through the tail of Comet Swift-Tuttle  causing shooting stars as tiny particles streak through Earth’s atmosphere. This year  the peak is expected on the night of August 12  with dozens of meteors expected each hour. Look to the northeast after midnight  and keep your list of wishes on hand.  • The International Space Station: The second brightest object in the night sky after the full Moon  the Station can be seen with the naked eye. It looks much like an aircraft  minus the blinking lights. To see the Station  visit http://heavens-above.com and enter the name of your hometown. When you see the Station glide by overhead  think of the Canada wordmark waving proudly on Canadarm2 and Dextre  the Canadian Space Agency robots hard at work on board. Canadian astronaut Col. Chris Hadfield will join them when he blasts off to the Station in December 2012 for a six-month mission that will make him the first Canadian Commander of the orbiting science lab.  • The Northern Lights: The aurora borealis are frequent in Canada’s North  but they can also be seen in southern parts of the country during periods of intense solar activity.

RRM: Dextre’s Duty Log for Day 3  Dextre capped off three days of success for the Robotic Refueling Mission (RRM) on June 21  2012. Using the Multifunction Tool built by NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center  Dextre used an adapter to perform a series of intricate ops beneath the RRM ambient cap  including using a plunger inside the tool to simulate breaking the seal on a fuel tank—an essential step in refueling a real satellite (the fuel tank on most satellites is sealed up prior to launch  since they are usually not designed to be repaired). One of the goals of RRM is to demonstrate how robots could perform the tasks necessary for refueling and servicing a satellite in space.   After completing work on the plug and ambient cap  Dextre then picked up another adapter for the Multifunction Tool (similar to a multi-bit screwdriver—Dextre switched adapters throughout the three days much like a handyman changes the tips for a screwdriver). Dextre succeeded in fitting the adapter on a tertiary cap on the RRM module  a task which required minute precision  and which is even difficult for human hands. Afterwards  Dextre stowed the multifunction tool and its adapter in the RRM tool bay and conducted some tests on a nozzle tool that will be used during the next phase of RRM  when Dextre will simulate refueling the RRM mock satellite.

The scientific harvest from Giotto changed people's perception of comets. By measuring its composition  Giotto confirmed Halley as a primitive remnant of the Solar System  billions of years old. It detected complex molecules locked in Halley's ices that could have provided the chemical building blocks of life on Earth.  Yet the biggest triumph was the image of Halley itself. "It was a once-in-a-lifetime event and it had a big impact on the general public " says Giotto's former Deputy Project Scientist  Gerhard Schwehm.

On this day: 22 February 1996  Space Shuttle mission STS-75 was launched  carrying ESA astronauts Maurizio Cheli (IT) and Claude Nicollier (CH) and ASI astronaut Umberto Guidoni (IT). The main objective of this flight was to carry the Tethered Satellite System Reflight (TSS-1R) into orbit and to deploy it on a tether. TSS-1R was a reflight of TSS-1 which was flown on STS-46 in 1992. This was the second spaceflight with three Europeans on board., HER, photo
On this day: 20 February 1999  Soyuz TM-29 carried  French ESA astronaut Jean-Pierre Haigneré  Slovakian cosmonaut Ivan Bella and cosmonaut Viktor Afanasyev to the Mir space station. Together with Afanasyev and resident cosmonaut Sergei Avdeyev  Haigneré stayed on Mir for 188 days  his second long-duration visit., HER, photo
On this day: 19 February 1473  Nicolaus Copernicus was born in the city of Toruń (Thorn) in Poland. Copernicus was the Renaissance mathematician and astronomer who formulated the 'heliocentric model' of the Solar System which placed the Sun  rather than Earth  at the centre. The publication of his book  'De revolutionibus orbium coelestium' (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres)  just before his death in 1543  is considered a major event in the history of science - beginning the Copernican Revolution and contributing importantly to the scientific revolution (the emergence of modern science)., HER, photo
On this day: 18 February 1677  Jacques Cassini was born   at the Paris Observatory. He was the son of astronomer  mathematician and engineer Giovanni Domenico Cassini  with whom he made numerous astronomical observations. Eventually  he took over his father's duties as head of the Paris Observatory. His direct measurement of the proper motions of the stars (1738) disproved the ancient belief in the unchanging sphere of the stars. He also studied the moons of Jupiter and Saturn and the structure of Saturn's rings., HER, photo
Before launch  on 16 February 2004  ESA Rosetta Project Manager John Ellwood  along with a few of his team members  made time to go and say farewell to their spacecraft. Hi res at http://sci.esa.int/rosetta/34722-farewell/, HER, photo
On this day: 11 February 2000  ESA astronaut Gerhard Thiele was launched on Space Shuttle Endeavour  STS-99  on the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). This was also the last solo flight of Endeavour; all future flights for Endeavour became devoted to the International Space Station., HER, photo
On this day: 10 February 1997  ESA astronaut Reinhold Ewald was launched on Soyuz TM-25 to the Russian Mir space station  with Vasili Tsibliyev and Alexander Lazutkin. He spent 20 days in space. (At the time  Ewald was working for DLR; in February 1999  he joined ESA's European Astronaut Corps at EAC  Cologne  Germany.)(spacefacts.de), HER, photo

On this day  7 February 2008  the Space Shuttle Atlantis was launched on the STS-122 mission to the ISS. STS-122 delivered the European Columbus laboratory module  developed by ESA  to the Station. It also returned Expedition 16 Flight Engineer Dan Tani to Earth  replacing him on Expedition 16 by ESA astronaut Léopold Eyharts (FR). ESA astronaut Hans Schlegel (DE) also flew on this mission  making a spacewalk to complete the connection of the laboratory., HER, photo
On this day: 5 February 2004  ESA announced that the #Rosetta mission's lander would be named 'Philae'  after the island in the River Nile. It was on this island that an obelisk was found with a bilingual inscription including the names of Cleopatra and Ptolemy in Egyptian hieroglyphs. This provided the French historian Jean-François Champollion with the final clues that enabled him to decipher the hieroglyphs of the Rosetta Stone and unlock the secrets of the civilisation of ancient Egypt.

On this day: 29 January 1998  CNES astronaut Léopold Eyharts (FR) was launched on Soyuz TM-27 to the Mir space station. During his first spaceflight  Eyharts' crewmates were cosmonauts Talgat Musabayev and Nikolai Budarin. The mission would exchange one Mir crew member  carry out the French Pégase mission and conduct science experiments. Eyharts joined ESA shortly after this mission  in August 1998., HER, photo

On this day: 22 January 1992  ESA's Ulf Merbold was launched on the STS-42 IML mission of Space Shuttle Discovery with a European Spacelab module. Merbold  ESA's first astronaut  was making his second spaceflight. The crew also included Canada's first female astronaut  Roberta Bondar., HER, photo
Uranus  the seventh planet of the Solar System  has 27 known moons. William Herschel discovered the first two moons  Titania and Oberon  in 1787  and the next three were discovered in 1851 by William Lassell (Ariel and Umbriel) and in 1948 by Gerard Kuiper (Miranda). These five have planetary mass  and so would be considered as dwarf planets if they were in direct orbit about the Sun. The remaining moons were discovered after 1985  some by Voyager 2 and some by Earth-based telescopes., HER, photo
On this day: 13 January 1610  Galileo discovered a fourth moon of Jupiter  later named Callisto. He had discovered three of Jupiter's four largest satellites a few days earlier. This view of Callisto is from NASA's Galileo spacecraft in May 2001., HER, photo
On this day: 11 January 1787  Sir William Herschel  the German-born British astronomer  discovered two moons of Uranus  Titania and Oberon., HER, photo
On this day: 7 January 1610  Galileo Galilei observed with his telescope what he described at the time as 'three fixed stars  totally invisible by their smallness'  all close to Jupiter  and lying on a straight line through it. Observations over the next nights showed that these 'stars' moved relative to Jupiter in a way that would have been inexplicable if they had really been fixed stars. On 10 January  Galileo noted that one of them had disappeared  an observation which he attributed to it being hidden behind Jupiter. Within a few days  he concluded that they were orbiting the planet: he had discovered three of Jupiter's four largest moons (later named Io  Europa  Ganymede). He discovered the fourth (Callisto) on 13 January., HER, photo
On this day: 1 January 1801  the minor planet Ceres was discovered by Italian priest and astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi. Ceres is the largest asteroid and the only dwarf planet in the inner Solar System. It was the first asteroid to be identified  though it was classified as a planet at the time. The image here is Ceres as seen by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope in 2005., HER, photo
ESA's second Automated Transfer Vehicle  seen here docking with the ISS in 2011  was named after German astronomer Johannes Kepler  who was born this day in 1571 (Kepler also lends his name to NASA's Kepler mission launched in 2009  craters on the Moon and Mars  and even an asteroid!), HER, photo
On this day: 27 December 1571  Johannes Kepler was born  in Weil der Stadt  near Stuttgart  in Germany. Kepler was a mathematician  astronomer and astrologer. A key figure in the 17th century scientific revolution  he is best known for his laws of planetary motion  which also provided one of the foundations for Isaac Newton's theory of universal gravitation (he is also known as an assistant to astronomer Tycho Brahe). ESA's second Automatic Transfer Vehicle (ATV) launched to resupply the ISS in 2011   and NASA's 2009 Kepler mission  as well as craters on the Moon and Mars  and an asteroid  are named after him., HER, photo
On this day: 25 December 1642  Isaac Newton was born  at Woolsthorpe Manor in Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth  a hamlet in the English county of Lincolnshire. Sir Isaac Newton was a physicist and mathematician who is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of all time. His book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica  first published in 1687  laid the foundations for most of classical mechanics. Newton also made contributions to optics and shares credit with Leibniz for inventing calculus., HER, photo
Close-up of the surface of Saturn's moon Rhea  which was discovered by Giovanni Cassini on 23 December 1672  seen here by the NASA/ESA/ASI spacecraft that bears his name on its fourth flyby in March 2013 (NASA/JPL), HER, photo
On this day: 23 December 1672  the Italian/French mathematician and astronomer Giovanni Cassini discovered Saturn's moon Rhea  the fifth major satellite of Saturn  which is one of the most heavily cratered satellites in the Solar System. Cassini is best known as the discoverer of four satellites of Saturn  and he noted the division of the rings of Saturn (named after him). He shares credit with British astronomer Robert Hooke for the discovery of the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. Cassini was also the first to observe differential rotation within Jupiter's atmosphere., HER, photo

On this day: 14 December 1546  Tycho Brahe (DK) was born (Tyge Ottesen Brahe)  in Scania  then part of Denmark  now part of modern-day Sweden. Brahe was a Danish nobleman known for his accurate and comprehensive astronomical and planetary observations. He was the last of the major naked-eye astronomers  working without telescopes for his observations. From 1600 until his death in 1601  he was assisted by Johannes Kepler who later used Brahe's astronomical data to develop his three Laws of Planetary Motion (pic: NISSAN MADS), HER, photo
Photo of the week: Landing of Space Shuttle Columbia  concluding the STS-9 mission  carrying Europe's  #Spacelab-1 and ESA's first astronaut Ulf Merbold  30 years ago this week  8 December 1983., HER, photo
On this day: 10 December 1999  ESA's XMM-Newton X-ray observatory was launched. XMM-Newton is the biggest science satellite ever built in Europe  its telescope mirrors are the most sensitive ever developed  and with its sensitive detectors  it sees much more than any previous X-ray satellite. More at http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/XMM-Newton_overview, HER, photo
On this day: 26 November 1988  French astronaut Jean-Loup Chrétien was launched on Soyuz TM-7  on the 24-day joint CNES/Russian Mir Aragatz mission. With him were cosmonauts Alexander Volkov and Sergei Krikalev., HER, photo
On this day: 11 November 1572  the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe observed a 'new star'  (B Cassiopeiae or Nova Cassiopeiae 1572)  one of the few recorded supernovae in the Milky Way. The appearance of this object is perhaps one of the most important events in the history of astronomy.   The 'new star' helped to revise ancient models of the heavens and to inaugurate a revolution in astronomy that began with the need to produce better star catalogues (and for more precise astronomical observing instruments).   However  Tycho was not even close to being the first to observe the 1572 supernova  although he was apparently the most accurate observer of the object (though not by much more other European colleagues).  Contemporary reports state that the new star appeared sometime between 2 and 6 November  when it rivalled Venus in brightness. The supernova remained visible to the naked eye into 1574  gradually fading until it disappeared from view., HER, photo
Launched on 30 October 1985  Space Shuttle flight STS-61A carried Europeans Wubbo Ockels  Ernst Messerschmid and Reinhard Furrer into space  and marked a number of firsts in European human spaceflight  including the first Dutch citizen in space and the first Spacelab mission to be controlled from the German operations centre of the DFVLR (a precursor of today's DLR) at Oberpfaffenhofen  near Munich., HER, photo
On this day: 29 October 1998  ESA astronaut Pedro Duque became the first Spaniard in space  launched on STS-95. This was the 25th flight of the Space Shuttle Discovery  also highly publicised due to former Mercury astronaut and US Senator John Glenn making his second spaceflight. At age 77  Glenn became the oldest person  to date  to go into space., HER, photo
On this day: 28 October 1971  the United Kingdom became the sixth nation to launch a satellite. Prospero was launched into orbit by a Black Arrow rocket from Woomera  Australia. Prospero was the only satellite launched by a British rocket (the first British satellite placed in orbit was Ariel 1  in April 1962  on a US rocket). The development of the Black Arrow launcher began in 1964 at the UK's Royal Aircraft Establishment but was cancelled in July 1971., HER, photo
On this day: 23 October 2007  Italian ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli was launched on STS-120. This mission of Space Shuttle Discovery delivered the Harmony module to the ISS. Harmony was built for NASA by Thales Alenia Space of Turin  Italy  as part of an agreement between NASA and ESA., HER, photo
On this day: 21 October 2001  ESA astronaut Claudie Haigneré was launched on Soyuz TM-33. Already the first French woman in space (visiting the Mir space station in 1996 as part of the Russian-French Cassiopée mission)  this flight made her the first European woman to visit the International Space Station  on her Andromède mission., HER, photo

On this day: 27 September 2003  ESA's SMART-1 left Earth on Europe's first journey to the Moon. It was launched from Europe’s Spaceport at Kourou  French Guiana. SMART-1 was one of three payloads on Ariane flight V162. While the other two satellites manoeuvred to geostationary orbits  SMART-1  with its revolutionary ion drive engine   began its much longer  circling journey to the Moon (ESA/CNES/Arianespace/Service optique CSG), HER, photo
On this day:  23 September 1846  Neptune was first observed by Berlin Observatory astronomer Johann Gottfried Galle (DE)  very near to the locations independently predicted by astronomers John Couch Adams (UK) and Urbain Joseph Le Verrier (FR).   Adams and Le Verrier had made their calculations based on the positions of Jupiter  Saturn and Uranus. An international dispute arose between the English and French (though not  apparently between Adams and Le Verrier personally) over priority and the right to name the new planet; they are now jointly credited with Neptune's discovery.   Subsequent observations have shown that the orbits calculated by Adams and Le Verrier diverge from Neptune's actual orbit fairly quickly. Had the search for the planet taken place a few years earlier or later it would not have been found anywhere near the predicted location (Image:NASA/JPL), HER, photo
Discovered this day in 1789  this is Mimas  a moon of Saturn  imaged by the international Cassini mission on 13 February 2010  from a distance of 70 000 km from Mimas. The surface of Mimas is dominated by an impact crater 130 km across (almost one third of the diameter of the entire moon)  called Herschel in honour of the moon's discoverer., HER, photo
