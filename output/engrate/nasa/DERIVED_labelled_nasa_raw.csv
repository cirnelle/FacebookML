Ready for Hurricane Season? The Atlantic Ocean hurricane season begins June 1 and runs through Nov. 30. This year  activity in the Atlantic basin began unusually early  with the development in January of Hurricane Alex in the eastern Atlantic. Our satellites provide information such as cloud and sea-surface temperatures  rainfall locations and rates of rainfall within each storm. See how we'll be studying future storms: http://go.nasa.gov/1Xsw11M,LER,Photo
