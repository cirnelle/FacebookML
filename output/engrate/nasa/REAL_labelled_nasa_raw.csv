This is the expanding remains of a massive star that exploded about 8 000 years ago. Called the Veil Nebula  the debris is one of the best-known supernova remnants  deriving its name from its delicate  draped filamentary structures. The entire nebula is 110 light-years across  covering six full moons on the sky as seen from Earth  and resides about 2 100 light-years away in the constellation Cygnus  the Swan. This view is a mosaic of six pictures from our Hubble Space Telescope of a small area roughly two light-years across  covering only a tiny fraction of the nebula's vast structure. This close-up look unveils wisps of gas  which are all that remain of what was once a star 20 times more massive than our sun. The fast-moving blast wave from the ancient explosion is plowing into a wall of cool  denser interstellar gas  emitting light. The nebula lies along the edge of a large bubble of low-density gas that was blown into space by the dying star prior to its self-detonation.  Image Credit: NASA/ESA/Hubble Heritage Team,HER,Photo

It's National Aviation Day! Even if you don't fly today  something you use on a regular basis probably did!  Aviation affects nearly every aspect of our lives. #FlyNASA,LER,Link
In 1939  President Franklin D. Roosevelt designated August 19 as National Aviation Day in honor of Orville Wright’s birthday  directing citizens to celebrate the day with activities that encourage an interest in and appreciation for aviation.   Why is NASA celebrating National Aviation Day? Because we love everything about flight  whether through space or Earth’s atmosphere.   Our experts in all things aviation are dedicated to improving the design of airplanes so they’re more Earth friendly – less fuel use  lower pollution  less noise around airports. And we work with the Federal Aviation Administration to provide air traffic controllers with new tools for improving efficiency and reducing delays – all while maintaining safety in more crowded skies.

What's our new cover image?   This image is based on a supercomputer climate simulation that shows two different sources of atmospheric carbon dioxide — fires (biomass burning) and massive urban centers known as megacities.  Scientists are using climate models like this one — called GEOS-5 (Goddard Earth Observing Model  Version 5  created at NASA Goddard) — to better understand how carbon dioxide moves around Earth’s atmosphere and how carbon moves through Earth’s air  land and ocean over time. Rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are driving Earth’s ongoing climate change.  This image is from June 2006. The model is based on real emissions inventory data and is then set to run so that scientists can observe how the greenhouse gas behaves in the atmosphere once it has been emitted.
