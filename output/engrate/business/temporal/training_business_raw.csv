To launch the Puffer Red's ed. 25th Anniversary of the Forum  we partnered with Complex magazine on an in-store retail event to launch their limited edition collaboration Forum.  They were one of 4 retailers who were selected as limited edition partners because they've carried adidas 25 years-since the launch of the Forum.  The other retailers were Moe's (Queens  NY)  Walter's (Atlanta)  and Harput's (San Francisco).  WJLB radio promoted the event  which was hosted by WJLB DJ Bushman with Mo Beatz on the decks.  Chauncey Billups made an appearance and signed some product to give away via a series of Piston's trivia questions.  In addition   Day 26 from MTV's "Making the Band" stopped in as well.,LER,video

adidas would like to thank Lassi Lankinen for her question on April 22nd regarding overseas credit cards with online shopping at www.shopadidas.com  it is very helpful for our future development.  We apologize but unfortunately our ordering system that we use automatically cancels orders placed with foreign credit cards and shipping or billing address based out of the US. Your order took a little longer to trigger cancellation due to the fact your requested shipping address was based in the United States.
