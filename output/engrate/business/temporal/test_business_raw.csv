We need your help  You may have heard that there’s a safety issue with six models of our Top Loader washing machines made between 2010 - 2013. In rare cases  this issue could cause smoke and in some cases fire to come from the machine. We first commenced the recall in April 2013 but there are still thousands of affected machines that are yet to be serviced.  All it takes to fix an affected machine is a quick  free service from one of our qualified technicians.  We need your help to ensure that other Australians – your family  your friends  your neighbours - remain safe and well.  Here’s how you can help. Firstly check your own machine. Get your parents to check their machines. Get your mates to check their machines. Get your neighbours to check their machines. Get anyone you know who has a Samsung Top Loader to check their machines.  What do you need to do!  Check if you have one of the impacted models – the model name is on the back of the machine.  The impacted models are: SW75V9WIP/XSA SW80SPWIP/XSA SW65V9WIP/XSA WA85GWGIP/XSA SW70SPWIP/XSA WA85GWWIP/XSA  If you have one of the affected models you need to get in touch with our Product Safety team.  You can call them on 1800 239 655  8am – 8pm  7 days or visit our website and lodge you details on our dedicated product safety page http://bit.ly/1HQTdkl,HER,photo

The all-new BMW 7 Series is the world’s first series-produced car that owners will be able to manoeuvre in or out of forward-parking spaces or garages without anyone at the wheel. The Remote Control Parking function allows the driver to conveniently hop out of the vehicle before parking it. The driver activates the remote-controlled parking function from outside the vehicle via the BMW display key. The entire parking procedure is monitored by Park Distance Control (PDC)  the Parking assistant and the Surround View sensors. In order to use the remote-controlled parking function  the vehicle has to be straight and centered  facing the parking space or garage. During the parking procedure the driver can bring the vehicle to a controlled stop if necessary. Once parked  the engine can be switched off via the key. And when it's time to move on  the engine can also be restarted via the key. #drivingluxury,HER,photo

The BMW i8 is a pioneer of its time; and there's no question that the right setting can add even more magic to the world's most progressive sports car. Michael Astarael Gao (https://www.facebook.com/gcseed) would certainly agree  and here are some of the pictures he took of his BMW i8 on an early June morning in Canada. BMW i _________ BMW i8 plug-in hybrid BMW eDrive: energy consumption (combined): 11 9 kWh/100 km Fuel consumption (combined): 2 1 l/100 km  CO2 emissions (combined): 49 g/km. Fuel consumption is determined in accordance with the ECE driving cycle (93/116/EC)  made up of approximately one-third urban traffic and two-thirds extra-urban driving (based on the distance covered).

Another story about a special relationship between a BMW and its owner: Love knows no age. When the 19-year-old student Matyáš Homola (https://instagram.com/matyashomola/) bought his first car  it was obviously a hard decision as to what model to choose. But despite the fact he has always been into motorsports  he didn't opt for a new car. He is now the proud owner of a 1978 BMW 3 Series  so his car is two times older than him. Lovingly  he named his 3 Series „Colette“ and takes great care in maintaining the classic soul of the car - he even has plans for exhibitions and some rally competitions. We are quite sure  this couple will have a great future together. #BMWstories #legends,HER,photo

When you are driving a BMW you are driving more than a car. You are driving the optimum driving pleasure  one that bonds you to both the road and your car unlike any other. This statement couldn't be more true for Samaa Aburomi from New Jersey. Don't believe us  here are her own words!  "I know people say it's wrong to love material things however  I'm head over heels for my BMW. If loving my BMW is wrong  I don't want to ever be right. For me  it's more than just a car. I get real pleasure from simply just driving my car. I can truthfully say that my BMW is my first true love. I'm never getting rid of it."  Use the hashtag #BMWstories to share your story.
