Here’s a favorite post of ours from the past: NASA astronaut Karen Nyberg  Russian Federal Space Agency cosmonaut Fyodor Yurchikhin and European Space Agency astronaut Luca Parmitano joined their Expedition 36 crewmates when the hatches between the Soyuz TMA-09M spacecraft and the International Space Station officially opened at 12:14 a.m. EDT. Expedition 36 Commander Pavel Vinogradov and Flight Engineer Alexander Misurkin of the Russian Federal Space Agency and Flight Engineer Chris Cassidy of NASA  who arrived at the station on March 28  welcomed the new crew members aboard their orbital home.  Nyberg  Yurchikhin and Parmitano's arrival restored the station's crew complement to six. They will continue scientific research aboard the space station. Expedition 36 will continue to take advantage of the orbital lab's unique microgravity environment and expand the scope of research. The crew will perform experiments that cover human research  biological and physical sciences  technology development and Earth observations. The crew also will engage in educational activities. During their stay aboard the space station  the crew will be welcome cargo resupply spacecraft from Japan  Europe and the United States. They also will perform and support five spacewalks (two U.S. and three Russian).  Vinogradov  Misurkin and Cassidy will return home in September. At that time Yurchikhin will become commander of Expedition 37. Nyberg  Yurchikhin and Parmitano will return to Earth in November. #ThrowbackThursday ,HER,photo

Three new Expedition 40 crew members were welcomed aboard the International Space Station when the hatches between their Soyuz spacecraft and the station were opened at 11:52 p.m. EDT Wednesday.  NASA astronaut Reid Wiseman  Soyuz Commander and cosmonaut Max Suraev of Roscosmos  the Russian Federal Space Agency and European Space Agency astronaut Alexander Gerst are slated to spend 166 days aboard the orbiting complex.  Commander Steve Swanson of NASA and Flight Engineers Oleg Artemyev and Alexander Skvortsov of Roscosmos  who have been aboard the orbiting complex since March 27  warmly greeted the newly arrived flight engineers. Afterward  all six crew members moved into the Zvezda service module so the station’s three newest residents could receive congratulatory calls from family members and VIPs gathered at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.  Wiseman  Suraev and Gerst launched from Baikonur at 3:57 p.m. (1:57 a.m. Thursday  Kazakh time) to begin a four-orbit chase to catch up with the station.  At the time of launch the station was soaring at an altitude of 260 statute miles  just south of Karaganda  Kazakhstan  having passed directly over the Baikonur launch site just two minutes and one second earlier.  The Soyuz docked automatically to the Earth-facing port of the station’s Rassvet Mini-Research Module-1 at 9:44 p.m. as the complex was flying at an altitude of  262 miles and off the coast of northern Peru.

Document of the Week  National Advisory Committee For Aeronautics (NACA) Resolution on the Subject of Space  Adopted January 16  1958.   Following the launch of first two Soviet Sputniks (in October and November 1957) the NACA created the Special Committee on Space Technology.  This committee was led by H. Guyford Stever  then associate dean of engineering at MIT.   The Special Committee's first written product was "A National Research Program for Space Technology " a staff study completed on January 14  1958.  The study characterized "the Soviet.....bid for world supremacy" as "a most serious challenge to the United States and the Western world " and called for "an energetic program for research and development for the conquest of space." The study also recommended that such a program follow "the pattern .... already developed by the NACA and the military services" and exemplified in the X-15 program  where "the scientific research [would] be the responsibility of a national civilian agency working in close cooperation with the applied research and development groups required for weapon-systems development by the military." This study was adopted by the NACA Executive Committee two days later  reappearing in a "Resolution on the Subject of Space Flight." The text of that resolution is shown in the 4 images below.

Documents of the Week:   Fact Sheet [December 1958] Office of Technical Liaison  Office of Chief Signal Officer  Department of the Army  Room BD1024  The Pentagon. [Launch of Project SCORE] And  excerpt from Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States  Dwight D. Eisenhower  1960-61  p.865.  Project SCORE (Signal Communications by Orbiting Relay Equipment)  was developed by the Department of Defense  Advanced Research Projects Agency (not by NASA). The resulting satellite  an 85-foot long Atlas 10-B missile  broadcast the first human voice from space  a tape of holiday greetings from President Eisenhower. When it was launched on December 18  it was one of the best kept secrets of the young space age. Fewer than 100 people knew that it was headed for orbit. Eisenhower’s Christmas message delivered by the satellite on December 19  1958 was selected as one of the “culturally  historically  or aesthetically significant recordings” to be included in the National Recording Registry at the Library of Congress in 2012.    The attached documents are a report on the project by the Chief Signal Officer of the U.S. Army  and the text of President Eisenhower's taped message that was broadcast on the satellite.

Document of the Week:  National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) Committee on Aerodynamics Meeting Minutes (excerpt)  Date: October 30  1947  Two weeks after Captain Charles Yeager had flown through Mach 1  breaking the “sound barrier”  the NACA committee responsible for high-speed flight research met. The NACA was interested in systematic research on high speed flight - not on setting arbitrary speed records. The Aerodynamics Committee was concerned that Army and Navy pilots on loan to the NACA for flight research programs might ignore the research program in the interest of setting new speed records. The Committee was concerned enough about this to send a message to the test pilots.,LER,photo
Document of the Week:  Memo from: Joel Baker  Engineer Test Pilot To: Chief of Research  Langley Field  Re: Operation of XS-1  October 25  1946  The United States Army Air Forces had wanted the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) to conduct the test flight program for the XS-1  the nation's first attempt at a rocket-propelled supersonic aircraft. (The name was later shortened to X-1.) However  the runways at the Langley Research Center were too short to safely land the XS-1. Engineers and other Langley personnel set up shop at the Muroc Army Air Field in California and conducted the tests there. This test group was the genesis of the NACA High Speed Flight Station  now NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center  and the XS-1 flights were the first NACA test program at the site. This letter details the results of the tests and the pilots’ evaluation of the XS-1 as an airplane (they weren't very impressed).,LER,photo
Space Shuttle Atlantis launched from Kennedy Space Center at 11:01 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time on August 2  1991.

On August 25  1989  (25 years ago today)  the Voyager 2 spacecraft had her final planetary encounter in our solar system.  Whizzing 4 950 kilometers (3 000 miles) over Neptune's north pole Voyager 2 became the first (and  so far  only) spacecraft to make a close fly by of this icy blue planet.  In fact  this pass was the closest that Voyager 2 had come to a planet since leaving the surface of the Earth on August 20  1977.    5 hours after the closest approach to Neptune  Voyager 2 passed 40 000 kilometers (25 000 miles) from Neptune's largest moon  Triton - returning spectacular imagery.  (see picture)  Voyager 2 also imaged the faint ring system around Neptune and a number of other smaller moons orbiting the big blue planet.,HER,photo
On September 17  1976  the first Space Shuttle Orbiter  which NASA had originally planed to name Space Shuttle Constitution  was rolled out of Rockwell's Air Force Plant 42  Site 1 in Palmdale  California. It was no coincidence; for on this date in 1787  the United States Constitution was signed  marking the beginning of our nation as we know it. In the US we celebrate this day as Constitution Day.  Another reason to choose the name Constitution for the first orbiter was to honor the USS Constitution - also known as "Old Ironsides."  Launched in 1797  Constitution was one of six original frigates authorized by the Naval Act of 1794. She is a wooden-hulled  three-masted heavy Navy frigate  and she is the oldest commissioned naval vessel afloat - currently home-based in Boston  MA.  However  fans of the popular TV show Star Trek thought the first shuttle should have a different name.  They started a write-in campaign urging the White House to name the first Shuttle Enterprise. President Gerald Ford eventually did so  honoring the fictional “Starship Enterprise.” Ironically  Enterprise was the only Shuttle not to have flown in space. As seen in this photo  the cast members of the original Star Trek series were on hand for the unveiling of the new Space Shuttle on this day in 1976.   After confirming the flight characteristics of the orbiter design in a series of Approach and Landing Tests and being used for a variety of other test and display purposes  Enterprise was turned over to the Smithsonian in 1985.  In 2012 Enterprise was transferred to the Intrepid Sea  Air and Space Museum  where she is now permanently displayed.

On September 23  1975  the final powered flight of the X-24B was piloted by NASA Research Pilot Bill Dana. The X-24B was an experimental research vehicle designed to test the possibilities of accurate  unpowered  re-entry vehicle landings. The X-24B represented the culmination of research done on a long line of wingless lifting bodies tested at NASA’s Flight Research Center (FRC) (now Armstrong Flight Research Center) between 1963 and 1975. The information gained from this research eventually led to the Space Shuttle’s design. The X-24B  as seen in the picture below  roughly resembles the Space Shuttle design with a flat underbelly and rounded top.   Top speed reached by the X-24B was 1 164 mph (Mach 1.75) by Air Force Major Mike Love on Oct. 25  1974. The highest altitude reached was 74 100 feet by NASA Research Pilot John Manke on May 22  1975. The X-24B was the final aircraft to fly in the lifting body research program.

On August 5  1969  NASA’s Mariner 7 spacecraft made a flyby of the planet Mars. Its closest approach was 3 430 kilometers  or about 2 131 miles.

ESA/Hubble Flashback: Hubble snaps images of a nebula within a cluster. Tag & share!  The unique planetary nebula NGC 2818 is nested inside the open star cluster NGC 2818A. Both the cluster and the nebula reside over 10 000 light-years away  in the southern constellation Pyxis (the Compass).  NGC 2818 is one of very few planetary nebulae in our galaxy located within an open cluster. Open clusters  in general  are loosely bound and they disperse over hundreds of millions of years. Stars that form planetary nebulae typically live for billions of years. Hence  it is rare that an open cluster survives long enough for one of its members to form a planetary nebula. This open cluster is particularly ancient  estimated to be nearly one billion years old.  Read more at: http://spacetelescope.org/images/ann0901a/  Credit:,HER,photo

ESA/Hubble Flashback: Hubble scores a perfect ten. Tag & share!  The NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope is back in business. Just a couple of days after the orbiting observatory was brought back online  Hubble aimed its prime working camera  the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2)  at a particularly intriguing target  a pair of gravitationally interacting galaxies called Arp 147.  The two galaxies happen to be oriented so that they appear to mark the number 10. The left-most galaxy  or the "one" in this image  is relatively undisturbed  apart from a smooth ring of starlight. It appears nearly edge-on to our line of sight. The right-most galaxy  the "zero" of the pair  exhibits a clumpy  blue ring of intense star formation.

The 'Ghost Head Nebula' is one of a chain of star-forming regions lying south of the 30 Doradus nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Two bright regions (the 'eyes of the ghost')  named A1 (left) and A2 (right)  are very hot  glowing 'blobs' of hydrogen and oxygen. The bubble in A1 is produced by the hot  intense radiation and powerful stellar wind from a single massive star. A2 has a more complex appearance due to the presence of more dust  and it contains several hidden  massive stars. The massive stars in A1 and A2 must have formed within the last 10 000 years since their natal gas shrouds are not yet disrupted by the powerful radiation of the newly born stars.

ESA/Hubble Flashback: Gravitationally lensed quasar HE 1104-1805. Tag & share!  This picture shows a quasar that has been gravitationally lensed by a galaxy in the foreground  which can be seen as a faint shape around the two bright images of the quasar.  Observations of one of the images show variations in colour over time. This is caused by stars within the lens galaxy passing through the path of the light from the quasar  magnifying the light from different parts of the quasar’s accretion disc as they move. This has allowed a team of scientists to reconstruct the colour and temperature profile of the accretion disc with unprecedented precision. The level of detail involved is equivalent to being able to study individual grains of sand on the surface of the Moon while standing on Earth.

ESA/Hubble Flashback: The Hourglass Nebula. Tag & share!  This is an image of MyCn18  a young planetary nebula located about 8 000 light-years away  taken with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).  This Hubble image reveals the true shape of MyCn18 to be an hourglass with an intricate pattern of 'etchings' in its walls. This picture has been composed from three separate images taken in the light of ionized nitrogen (represented by red)  hydrogen (green)  and doubly-ionized oxygen (blue).  The results are of great interest because they shed new light on the poorly understood ejection of stellar matter which accompanies the slow death of Sun-like stars. In previous ground-based images  MyCn18 appears to be a pair of large outer rings with a smaller central one  but the fine details cannot be seen.

ESA/Hubble Flashback: Hubble Finds Mature Galaxy Masquerading as Toddler. Tag & share!  The NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope quashed the possibility that what was previously believed to be a toddler galaxy in the nearby universe may actually be considered an adult. Called I Zwicky 18  this galaxy has a youthful appearance that resembles galaxies typically found only in the early universe. Hubble has now found faint  older stars within this galaxy  suggesting that the galaxy may have formed at the same time as most other galaxies.  I Zwicky 18 is classified as a dwarf irregular galaxy and is much smaller than our Milky Way Galaxy. The concentrated bluish-white knots embedded in the heart of the galaxy are two major starburst regions where stars are forming at a furious rate. The wispy blue filaments surrounding the central starburst regions are bubbles of gas that have been blown away by stellar winds and supernovae explosions from a previous generation of hot  young stars. This gas is now heated by intense ultraviolet radiation unleashed by hot  young stars.  Read more at: http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/heic0716a/  Credit: NASA  ESA  and A.

Astronomers have used the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope to study the young open star cluster IC 1590  which is found within the star formation region NGC 281 — nicknamed the Pacman Nebula due to its resemblance to the famous arcade game character. This image only shows the central part of the nebula  where the brightest stars at the core of the cluster are found  with part of the Pacman’s hungry mouth visible as the dark region below.  But Pacman isn’t gobbling up these stars. Instead  the nebula’s gas and dust are being used as raw ingredients to make new stars.

ESA/Hubble Flashback: Hubble Captures a “Lucky” Galaxy Alignment. Tag & share!  An interesting galaxy has been circled in this NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image. The galaxy — one of a group of galaxies called Luminous Red Galaxies — has an unusually large mass  containing about ten times the mass of the Milky Way. However  it’s actually the blue horseshoe shape that circumscribes the red galaxy that is the real prize in this image.  This blue horseshoe is a distant galaxy that has been magnified and warped into a nearly complete ring by the strong gravitational pull of the massive foreground Luminous Red Galaxy. To see such a so-called Einstein Ring required the fortunate alignment of the foreground and background galaxies  making this object’s nickname “the Cosmic Horseshoe” particularly apt.

ESA/Hubble Flashback: Seeing Quadruple  Tag & share!  This NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope picture may trick you into thinking that the galaxy in it — known as UZC J224030.2+032131 — has not one but five different nuclei. In fact  the core of the galaxy is only the faint and diffuse object seen at the centre of the cross-like structure formed by the other four dots  which are images of a distant quasar located in the background of the galaxy.  The picture shows a famous cosmic mirage known as the Einstein Cross  and is a direct visual confirmation of the theory of general relativity. It is one of the best examples of the phenomenon of gravitational lensing — the bending of light by gravity as predicted by Einstein in the early 20th century. In this case  the galaxy’s powerful gravity acts as a lens that bends and amplifies the light from the quasar behind it  producing four images of the distant object.

ESA/Hubble Flashback: Flocculent spiral NGC 2841. Tag & share!  Star formation is one of the most important processes in shaping the Universe; it plays a pivotal role in the evolution of galaxies and it is also in the earliest stages of star formation that planetary systems first appear.  Yet there is still much that astronomers don’t understand  such as how do the properties of stellar nurseries vary according to the composition and density of gas present  and what triggers star formation in the first place? The driving force behind star formation is particularly unclear for a type of galaxy called a flocculent spiral  such as NGC 2841 shown here  which features short spiral arms rather than prominent and well-defined galactic limbs.

ESA/Hubble Flashback: Nearby Dust Clouds in the Milky Way. Tag & share!  The yearly ritual of spring cleaning clears a house of dust as well as dust "bunnies"  those pesky dust balls that frolic under beds and behind furniture. NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope has photographed similar dense knots of dust and gas in our Milky Way Galaxy. This cosmic dust  however  is not a nuisance. It is a concentration of elements that are responsible for the formation of stars in our galaxy and throughout the universe.  These opaque  dark knots of gas and dust are called Bok globules  and they are absorbing light in the center of the nearby emission nebula and star-forming region  NGC 281. The globules are named after astronomer Bart Bok  who proposed their existence in the 1940's.

ESA/Hubble Flashback: A Poster-Size Image of the Beautiful Barred Spiral Galaxy NGC 1300. Tag & share!  One of the largest Hubble Space Telescope images ever made of a complete galaxy is being unveiled today at the American Astronomical Society meeting in San Diego  Calif.  The Hubble telescope captured a display of starlight  glowing gas  and silhouetted dark clouds of interstellar dust in this 4-foot-by-8-foot image of the barred spiral galaxy NGC 1300. NGC 1300 is considered to be prototypical of barred spiral galaxies. Barred spirals differ from normal spiral galaxies in that the arms of the galaxy do not spiral all the way into the center  but are connected to the two ends of a straight bar of stars containing the nucleus at its center.

ESA/Hubble Flashback: Young stars sculpt gas with powerful outflows. Tag & Share!  This Hubble Space Telescope view shows one of the most dynamic and intricately detailed star-forming regions in space  located 210 000 light-years away in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC)  a satellite galaxy of our Milky Way. At the centre of the region is a brilliant star cluster called NGC 346. A dramatic structure of arched  ragged filaments with a distinct ridge surrounds the cluster.  A torrent of radiation from the hot stars in the cluster NGC 346  at the centre of this Hubble image  eats into denser areas around it  creating a fantasy sculpture of dust and gas. The dark  intricately beaded edge of the ridge  seen in silhouette  is particularly dramatic. It contains several small dust globules that point back towards the central cluster  like windsocks caught in a gale.

ESA/Hubble Flashback: A star formation laboratory  Galaxy NGC 4214  pictured here in an image from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope’s newest camera  is an ideal location to study star formation and evolution. Dominating much of the galaxy is a huge glowing cloud of hydrogen gas in which new stars are being born. A heart-shaped hollow — possibly galaxy NGC 4214’s most eye-catching feature — can be seen at the centre of this. Inside this cavity lies a large cluster of massive  young stars ranging in temperature from 10 000 to 50 000 degrees Celsius. Their strong stellar winds are responsible for the creation of this bubble. These features have the effect of stemming any further star formation due to the subsequent lack of gas.

ESA/Hubble Flashback: Debris Ring Around a Star: Unannotated   The top view  taken by NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope  is the first visible-light image of a dust ring around the nearby  bright young star Fomalhaut (HD 216956). The image offers the strongest evidence yet that an unruly planet may be tugging on the dusty belt. Part of the ring [at left] is outside the telescope's view. The ring is tilted obliquely to our line of sight.  The center of the ring is about 1.4 billion miles (15 astronomical units) away from the star. The dot near the ring's center marks the star's location. Astronomers believe that an unseen planet moving in an elliptical orbit is reshaping the ring.

ESA/Hubble Flashback: Star on a Hubble diet  The star cluster Pismis 24 lies in the core of the large emission nebula NGC 6357 that extends one degree on the sky in the direction of the Scorpius constellation. Part of the nebula is ionised by the youngest (bluest) heavy stars in Pismis 24. The intense ultraviolet radiation from the blazing stars heats the gas surrounding the cluster and creates a bubble in NGC 6357. The presence of these surrounding gas clouds makes probing into the region even harder.  One of the top candidates for the title of "Milky Way stellar heavyweight champion" was  until now  Pismis 24-1  a bright young star that lies in the core of the small open star cluster Pismis 24 (the bright stars in the Hubble image) about 8 000 light-years away from Earth. Pismis 24-1 was thought to have an incredibly large mass of 200 to 300 solar masses. New NASA/ESA Hubble measurements of the star  have  however  resolved Pismis 24-1 into two separate stars  and  in doing so  have "halved" its mass to around 100 solar masses.

10 Things ....  Special Wave at Saturn Edition  Friday (July 19) will be the first time in history Earthlings have had advance notice their picture was being taken from deep space.  1. WHO? You and everyone you know. NASA is asking everyone to stop what they doing and wave toward Saturn on Friday  July 19 between 5:27 and 5:42 p.m. EDT (2:27 to 2:42 p.m. PDT or 21:27 to 21:42 UTC). Take a picture of your Saturn salute and share it on your favorite social media site with the hashtag <b>#WaveAtSaturn</B>.  2. WHAT? Cassini will be able to see the whole Saturn system backlit by the sun on July 19. It's a great science opportunity and it makes a beautiful picture - one that happens to have Earth in the background as well.  3. WHAT WILL YOU SEE? Cassini's image of Earth will be just 1.5 pixels wide  with the illuminated part of Earth less than a pixel  so the resulting mosaic will not actually show people or the continents. But if you are on the sunlit side of Earth at the time - North America and part of the Atlantic Ocean -- you are in the picture.   4. WHERE? For those in the western U.S.  step outside (or stay inside) and wave low on your eastern horizon. Wave southeast in the central and eastern U.S. as Cassini's cameras take a series of pictures over about 15 minutes  5. WHY? Because it's a rare opportunity to image Earth from other outer solar system. It's only been done twice before - and those times everyone didn't have advance notice to wave.  6. HOW? Unlike two previous Cassini eclipse mosaics of the Saturn system in 2006  which captured Earth  and another in 2012  the July 19 image will be the first to capture the Saturn system with Earth in natural color  as human eyes would see it. It also will be the first to capture Earth and its moon with Cassini's highest-resolution camera.  7. FIRST PHOTO The first photo was dark  so the team pushed the colors to bring out details (in a sense creating a false color image).  8. NO ONE TO WAVE The 2006 showed Venus instead of Earth.  9. ALMOST LIKE BEING THERE The July 19 photo will show Earth and the moon in the way you would see them if you were orbiting Saturn.  10. SCIENCE Waving is fun  but the real opportunity is for science. The spacecraft's unique vantage point in Saturn's shadow will provide a special scientific opportunity to look at the planet's rings.

"The most surprising moon visited by Voyager was Jupiter's moon Io. We had no idea that we could have a moon similar in size to our own moon that had two to three hundred active volcanoes going off on it all the time. We only flew past Io a few times during the Voyager encounters  but every time we did fly by there were hundreds of volcanoes erupting on this moon.  The finding of volcanism on Io really changed our idea of what a habitable zone means in the solar system. We thought that the outer solar system was cold  icy and dead. We also thought that a planet or moon could only have liquid water or sufficient warmth if it was "snuggled up" close to a star. However  we found moons that run on tidal energy rather than sunlight in the outer solar system."  --Michelle Thaller: Assistant Director of Science for Communications  NASA Goddard Space Flight Center  More thoughts from Michelle: http://1.usa.gov/17DaVq3,HER,photo

Stargazing tips from our resident expert  Dr. Steve Edberg:   Seeing some of the planets is not too hard if you use the Moon as a guide.  On November 1  the Moon passes by Jupiter  colored white and the brightest “star” near the Moon or anywhere in the sky at that time of night.  Look towards the east around 9:00 p.m. (but you can try earlier in the evening if you want).  On November 11 the Moon will be passing by brilliant Venus  the brightest object in the sky besides the Sun and Moon.  Look at around 6:00 a.m. very low in the east (by coincidence).  Venus may well be easier to see than the Moon.  The next morning on November 12 the Moon will be harder to see but directly below Venus the next morning at about 6:40 a.m.  Golden Saturn will be directly to the Moon’s left (and to the lower left of Venus).  Don’t get confused by the blue star Spica  closer to Venus and to its lower right above the Moon.   At 6:40 p.m. on November 16 back in the western evening sky (soon after sunset) you might be able to find Mars near the Moon. They will be low on the southwestern horizon  with orangish Mars directly left of the Moon.  The same time the next night the Moon will be higher and easier to see and you will find Mars to its lower right.  The other planets are either too faint (Uranus and Neptune)to see or lost in the glare of the Sun (Mercury) in November.,HER,status

Love Letters to Mars Missions:  Many missions came before Mars Science Laboratory  which is only four days away from touchdown on Mars.  Read what these and other scientists have said about the missions that have sparked our imaginations for the last 50 years and vote for your own favorite moments.   http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/50th/index.cfm  “The robotic exploration of Mars is of tremendous importance. Here there are many great missions: from the orbiters and surveyors  to the Viking landers  to the rovers rolling around on the surface of the Red Planet. The Mars missions have been and continue to be extremely important in the search for life.”  --Bill Borucki: Science Principal Investigator for the Kepler Mission (More: http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=2477)  “Pathfinder used innovative air bag technology for the landing  and its rover  Sojourner  was the cute little rover that could -- and it did.”  --Suzanne Dodd: Project Manager  Voyager Interstellar Mission  Jet Propulsion Laboratory (More: http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=2492)  "Spirit and Opportunity have each made amazing discoveries. The Mars Exploration Rovers have told us about the geology and science of Mars. And Opportunity continues to tell us more and more about how the climate has changed on Mars.   Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter observed the landing of Phoenix from its orbital view about the Red Planet. This landing demonstrated the power of having a program of exploration (not just individual missions). Also  the Phoenix observations on the surface of nearly-pure water ice just centimeters beneath the circumpolar surface of Mars further informs us about this planet.  The Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft is the next opportunity we'll have to make discoveries about Mars.”  --Cassie Conley: Planetary Protection Officer  NASA Headquarters (More: http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=2495)   On Viking: “1976: It was so exciting waiting for the twin Viking landers to touch down on the surface of Mars. … This moment was so moving  and symbolic of my generation's perspective on planetary exploration.”  --Bob Pappalardo: Project Scientist  Jet Propulsion Laboratory (More: http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=2472)  “I very often look at the pictures of Mars that are coming back from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) and from the rovers. I enjoy watching the little movie of the dust devils -- the little tornadoes turning around on the deserts of Mars. When I look at that great little video I think: "That is Mars! That is Mars where those tornadoes are and here I am watching them!"  --Michelle Thaller  Assistant Director of Science for Communications  NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (More: http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=2471)  On Viking: “Their images of the Martian surface  with its rocks and gravel  were the very first to tell us that Mars looked a lot like home.”  On MER: “The plucky rover twins and their indefatigable travels across unexpectedly wide regions of Mars have brought a tangible feeling of ‘being there’ to scientists and the public alike.”  --Jeff Cuzzi  Research Scientist  Ames Research Center (More: http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=2470)  On Viking: “There was something about that moment that really furthered my romance with the planets  because once you are there on the surface of another planet  or have a machine there photographing landscapes  it makes it much easier to imagine yourself looking across the Martian landscape with the dust swirling around your ankles. There was just something very evocative about that moment that I will never forget it.”  --David Grinspoon  Curator of Astrobiology  Denver Museum of Nature and Science (More: http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=2469)  “For the past eight years they have become very familiar  almost like friends -- very  very far away friends. The landscapes  especially at Meridiani  are very beautiful to me.”  --Paolo Belluta  Machine Vision Group/Mars Exploration Rover Driver  Jet Propulsion Laboratory (More: http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=2491)   On Mariner 9: “One could also point to Mariner 9 at Mars back in the early 70s when we really got our first view of a non-Earth planet.  I actually  as a teenager  heard Carl Sagan talk about it and I was impressed by this mission. This was before Pioneer  this was before Viking  before everything. This mission made us realize that Mars was an object with a different kind of geology  but that there were some similarities  as well as differences.”  --Fran Bagenal  Professor of Astrophysical and Planetary Sciences  University of Colorado  Boulder Co-Investigator for the New Horizons Mission (More: http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=2457)  “I am super excited for the next phase of Mars exploration. I look at how the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) has changed our view of the surface of Mars and I think that MSL will do something very similar -- in terms of showing us things we couldn't imagine on Mars; making Mars a planet  in our minds  more like the Earth than we currently see it.  At least for me  before MRO  Mars was red and dusty everywhere. Now  we have all these images of a diverse and active planet: beautiful rock formations  dunes  flow features (possible evidence for water just below the surface)  glaciers  and erupted geyser-like features -- so-called "spiders" -- in the north.”  --Steve Vance  Planetary Scientist/Astrobiologist  Jet Propulsion Laboratory (More: http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=2479),HER,photo

Let's Ride!  Cowboy Joe (NACA High-Speed Flight Station test pilot Joseph Walker) and his steed (Bell Aircraft Corporation X-1A) A happy Joe was photographed in 1955 at Edwards  California. The X-1A was flown six times by Bell Aircraft Company pilot Jean "Skip" Ziegler in 1953. Air Force test pilots Maj. Charles "Chuck" Yeager and Maj. Arthur "Kit" Murray made 18 flights between 21 November 1953 and 26 August 1954. The X-1A was then turned over to the NACA. Joe Walker piloted the first NACA flight on 20 July 1955. Walker attemped a second flight on 8 August 1955  but an explosion damaged the aircraft just before launch. Walker  unhurt  climbeed back into the JTB-29A mothership  and the X-1A was jettisoned over the Edwards AFB bombing range.  See: http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=E-1758,LER,photo

Curiosity: How to Boldly Go...  Operating a one-ton rover on the surface of Mars requires more than just a joystick and an experiment. With 10 science instruments  17 cameras  a radioisotope thermoelectric generator and lasers  Curiosity is the largest and most complex rover NASA has sent to Mars. Combined with a 1 way light time of 4 to 20 minutes and a distributed international science and engineering team  it takes a lot of work to operate this mega-rover. The Mars Science Lab's operations team has developed an organization and process that maximizes science return and safety of the spacecraft. These are the voyages of the rover Curiosity  its 2 year mission  to determine the habitability of Gale Crater  to understand the role of water  to study the climate and geology of Mars.

The NASA-improved X-ray fluorescence (XRF) scanners have been particularly well received in museums  where they are used to authenticate artifacts and works of art and assist those who conserve them. The scanner’s ability to detect the elemental composition of an object with a simple  nondestructive scan makes it ideal for analyzing precious  rare  or delicate items. Kaiser estimates that more than 600 museums and universities worldwide now use the device  including such institutions as the National Archives  the Field Museum of Natural History  the Louvre  the National Gallery  and the British Museum.   One reason the device is so popular is that experts in art history or archeology can easily be taught how to use it. “It doesn’t take a chemist to operate it ” says Bruce Kaiser  a scientist and pioneer in XRF technology  “I can teach anyone how to point the scanner  look at the color pattern  and figure out what they’ve got.”   As a practical example of the technology’s impact  Kaiser cites art authentication: “I can make something look yellow  but there are a hundred different ways to make something look yellow. Van Gogh only used one. If a museum is eyeing a newly discovered painting  it might be beautiful  it might have the right style and details  but if the elements in the pigments don’t match what Van Gogh used  then you know it’s not his. And yet the museum was about to spend $2 million on it.”   Read more: http://go.usa.gov/jxad And even more: http://go.usa.gov/jxaF,LER,photo

Slow and steady!  The crawlers are unique in the world  having been built in 1965 to move the massive Saturn V rocket from Kennedy’s Vehicle Assembly Building to Launch Complex 39. After the moon landing and Skylab programs ended  the crawlers continued their work  taking space shuttles to their launch pads for 30 years.  With the shuttle fleet retired in 2011  the crawlers are envisioned as critical elements of future launch operations at Kennedy. One is expected to take commercially operated rockets and spacecraft to the launch pad. The other is being strengthened to handle the Space Launch System (SLS)  a rocket and launch tower combination heavier than even the Saturn V moon rockets the crawlers were designed for. - From: http://go.usa.gov/bJ9V Read more: http://go.usa.gov/bJ95 and search more: http://go.usa.gov/bJXz,LER,photo

'Supermoon' is a situation when the moon is slightly closer to Earth in its orbit than on average  and this effect is most noticeable when it occurs at the same time as a full moon.

Cas A: Optical and X-ray   The aftermath of a cosmic cataclysm  supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (Cas A) is a comfortable 11 000 light-years away. Light from the Cas A supernova  the death explosion of a massive star  first reached Earth just 330 years ago. Still expanding  the explosion's debris cloud spans about 15 light-years near the center of this composite image. The scene combines color data of the starry field and fainter filaments of material at optical energies with image data from the orbiting NuSTAR X-ray telescope. Mapped to false colors  the X-ray data in blue hues trace the fragmented outer boundary of the expanding shock wave  glowing at energies up to 10 000 times the energy of the optical photons.

Early Years at Marshall  Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) offers a great example of how the development of a NASA center created mini melting pots of cultures  from around the country and world   united in pursuing engineering and scientific challenges.     “Graduates of southern universities predominated among new employees in Huntsville  but people came from around the nation. Art Sanderson  who made recruiting trips as part of his responsibilities in the personnel office  recalled that ‘They wanted top-notch engineers and we had a charter to go all over this country to get them.’ [William] Snoddy  a die-hard Crimson Tide fan  said that the diverse origins of his fellow workers became most noticeable during football season. ‘It was really strange to be in Alabama and yet work around people that didn’t care ’ he laughed. ‘They had these weird teams they were cheering for. Some of them were even Yankee teams [from] places I’d never heard of like North Dakota.’” (NASA SP-4313 pp.17-18)  Read more about it at http://go.usa.gov/bwWA and search what Marshall is doing these days at http://go.usa.gov/bwZY.,LER,photo

Looks like Project Morpheus continues on track for ignition at 3 p.m. EDT.   Streaming goes live 20 minutes before #FreeFlight  and can be watched at: http://1.usa.gov/1m8LI8y  Project Morpheus integrates NASA's automated landing and hazard avoidance technology with an engine that runs on liquid oxygen and methane  or "green" propellants  into a fully operational lander that could deliver cargo to asteroids and other planetary surfaces. Morpheus and ALHAT are examples of the partnerships that exist within the agency since seven of the 10 NASA centers have contributed time  energy and resources to both.    During today's 98-second test  Morpheus will ascend from the ground over the flame trench to a maximum altitude of more than 800 feet at a peak speed of 36 mph. Morpheus then will fly forward and downward covering approximately 1 300 feet while performing a 78-foot divert to simulate a hazard avoidance maneuver. The test is being performed with ALHAT operating in an open-loop mode  scanning the hazard field and identifying safe landing sites during flight  but not yet navigating the autonomous Morpheus vehicle.  ,LER,link

The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager extends the capabilities of the SOHO/MDI instrument with continual full-disk coverage at higher spatial resolution and new vector magnetogram capabilities. In other words  HMI provides us with about one terabyte of data a day. giving us insights into sunspots and their magnetic fields.  Read up about the biggest sunspots in Solar Cycle 24.,LER,photo

#Cosmochat  Question: How long did it take to plan and design NASA SDO?  I remember the very early days and it sure take a lot of time to put a space mission together.   Pre-Phase A- 1997 - After the launch of the Solar & Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) in 1995  solar scientists began thinking about what data they were still lacking that was necessary to do the science that they wanted to do. From this needs assessment and based on lessons-learned from the SOHO build  launch and data they began to develop the preliminary ideas for the next Heliophysics strategic mission.  For the SDO  Lockheed Martin  Solar and Astrophysics Laboratory was selected to build and operate the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)  and to build the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI). HMI would be operated and the huge data stream (~4 TB per day) managed at Stanford University  while the University of Colorado  Boulder would build and operate the Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE).  Phase A- 2002- The deliverable at the end of Phase A is System Concept Study report which contains  more specific instrument requirements  a more complete budget.   Phase B- 2003- During Phase B  the preliminary plan is converted into a baseline technical solution - requirements are further defined  schedules are determined  and specifications are prepared to initiate system design and development. The deliverable at the end of the phase is the Preliminary Design review document  which sets out very specific requirements for the build and testing of the instruments down to how many threads a bolt will have  and the exact pressure that will be used to attach said bolt.  Phase C and D- Build  Integration and Testing- 2004 Phase C represents the beginning of the implementation stage. The Phase C deliverable is the Critical Design Review  There is a lot of activity in Phase C including: ·      Procurement of all aspects of the space craft o   Announcements of opportunity go out in 2005 for technical aspects of the space craft.  These announcements unlike the instrument announcements contain of the design and technical specifications required. o   Manpower profile peak- All manners of engineers are modeling  building and testing every aspect of the spacecraft for various factors  operations  ability to withstand space  integration with other spacecraft instruments and bus. o   HMI  EVE and AIA are built onsite at the subcontract locations o   The Testing of all of the parts of the spacecraft in the thermal vacuum chambers and on the vibration tables to ensure that they are space ready. Phase D Deliverable is the pre-ship review  and the completed and launched spacecraft. o     At this point there is a comprehensive audit in which all of the procurements are matched up with budget items and check lists Launch an initial commissioning takes place during phase D.  Phase E- Science mission and Operations- 2010 During Phase E science data is collected and made available to the public for scientific investigations that take place around the world.  The mission is monitored 24 hours a day 7 days a week by the mission operations team at Goddard Space Flight Center.  The instruments are monitored and operated at their respective institutions.  To date SDO has met minimum mission success  meaning it has fulfilled all of the mission goals.

And here is my first video from today's rather huge solar flare. Right at midnight UT time the active region 1429 unleashed a powerful X5.4-class solar flare. X-class flares are the strongest of the flares. They are major events that can trigger planet-wide radio blackouts and long-lasting radiation storms.  It appears that right after the large X5.4 flare another slightly lower  X1 flare (5 times smaller)  occurred. You can clearly see a wave going across the Sun.   We are still gathering data and the Space Weather Forecast Lab will be having updates available soon.   Credit: NASA SDO,LER,video

I work as an electrical system design engineer on the overall system architecture for the Space Launch System (SLS) core stage flight avionics  specifically the Command Telemetry Controller (CTC). It’s an important  unique component  as the central communication portal for our vehicle core stage element.   During the mission  the two CTCs on the vehicle are the primary collectors of data for telemetry downlink.  The CTCs format the data stream from cameras  over a thousand sensors  and the flight computer’s operations. That data stream is directed to the vehicle radios for downlink to ground stations. While the vehicle is on the launch pad  the CTCs are the conduit between ground operations and the flight computers.  In this mode  the CTCs perform a critical safety function.   The biggest challenge of my current work is not only to make this complex electronic box work in a short period of time  but to integrate it with other boxes properly. It’s a fun and challenging job  but you really need to be enthusiastic about what you are doing in order to have such commitment. It’s rewarding work  and I feel patriotic about it because I’m helping provide America the next-generation heavy-lift vehicle that will carry astronauts safely on different missions.   It was always interesting to me to watch the shuttle flights on television when I was young because there are limited Space Programs available in Taiwan.  To be part of the SLS Program satisfies a dream I had when I was a kid  and I’m looking forward to watching the launch with my two daughters some day.  I’d advise anyone who has aspirations to work in space exploration to study hard  do the things you love to do and do not be afraid to make mistakes.,LER,photo

New imagery from the Hubble Space Telescope is revealing details never before seen on Jupiter. Hubble’s new Jupiter maps were used to create this Ultra HD animation still.  These new maps of Jupiter were made from observations performed with NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope. They are the first products to come from a program to study the solar system’s outer planets – Jupiter  Uranus  Neptune and  later  Saturn – each year using Hubble. The observations are designed to capture a broad range of features  including winds  clouds  storms and atmospheric chemistry. These annual studies will help current and future scientists see how these giant worlds change over time.  Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center  the Jet Propulsion Laboratory  and the University of California at Berkeley produced two global maps of Jupiter from the observations  which were made using Hubble’s high-performance Wide Field Camera 3.  The two maps represent nearly back-to-back rotations of the planet  making it possible to determine the speeds of Jupiter’s winds. Already  the images have revealed a rare wave just north of the planet’s equator and a unique filament-like feature in the core of the Great Red Spot that had not been seen previously.  In addition  the new images confirm that the Great Red Spot continues to shrink and become more circular  as it has been doing for years. The long axis of this characteristic storm is about 150 miles (240 kilometers) shorter now than it was in 2014. Recently  the storm had been shrinking at a faster-than-usual rate  but the latest change is consistent with the long-term trend.

We're fewer at the dinner table on the International Space Station tonight as our three friends await to return to Earth.   But when we were nine people aboard the space station  it's a bit of a full house. It's been a solid  busy week since Andy  Sergei and Aidyn joined the rest of us. It's not every day you get to work with such a unique crew comprised of good people from five different countries: Russia  USA  Denmark  Japan and Kazakhstan.  At the end of the day  the dinner table acts as a unifier  a place of community. Sharing a meal gives us a chance to put aside work and catch up with one another. While nutrition is important to us physically - maintaining our health and mitigating the negative effects of microgravity on our bodies - mealtime also is important to us psychologically.  Dining together can radically shift perspectives  blurring boundaries just as looking down on Earth from our vantage point  especially  when dinner partners are from all different corners of the world. But also mealtime lets us build a sense of camaraderie.  Andy  Aidyn and Gennady - whom I launched to the International Space Station with nearly six months ago - will begin their journey home today. I will miss those guys. They are good friends to break bread with.  Eat simply  and eat together. #YearInSpace  Watch this video and others during my year in space on YouTube > https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM-p4l2OPH_oX6tFrjKT-9A,HER,video

Flashback Friday to last Friday when my Soyuz crew mates and I took a mini space vacation to move our spacecraft for the visitors that arrived at the International Space Station today!  After a little more than five months of our stay  we left our orbital home for a 20-minute get away to move our spacecraft. We undocked our Soyuz that brought us to the space station back in late March from the Poisk module of the International Space Station  and we reparked it at the orbiting laboratory’s Zvezda service module where it now resides.  Moving the Soyuz spacecraft cleared the Poisk module for the arrival of our new Expedition 45 crew member Sergei Volkov  and visiting crew members Andreas (Andy) Mogensen and Aidyn Aimbetov.  It's the first time in nearly two years since nine crew members are aboard the station simultaneously. It's a full house.  Andy and Aidyn  a Kazakh cosmonaut I just met for the first time  will return to Earth with Padalka in about a week on Sept. 12.  Misha and I will stay for the remainder of a year and return to Earth - March 2016 - on the newly arrived Soyuz.  #YearInSpace,HER,video

Meteorites have been found all across Antarctica. It’s not that they fall only there; they fall randomly all over the world. The ice-covered continent is just an easy place to find them.   For this reason  researchers have traveled there annually for more than three decades to recover meteorites. The Antarctic Search for Meteorites (ANSMET) program is an inexpensive yet guaranteed way to recover meteorites from the Moon  Mars  and asteroids. These rocks are critical to our understanding of the history of the solar system  providing essential "ground-truth" for our study of the asteroids  planets  and other bodies of our solar system.   Jointly supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and NASA  the field work is led by Dr. Ralph P. Harvey at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. Two teams of researchers left for the Antarctic in mid-November to begin this year’s hunt for meteorites. NASA astronaut Stan Love  making his second trip to Antarctica for ANSMET  is on the Systematic Search Team  which will go to Grosvenor Mountains to search the ice fields where meteorites are known to exist. The other team  called the Reconnaissance Team  will go first to the Robison Glacier area and then to Amundsen Glacier. Their task is to identify regions that may harbor meteorites for future exploration in more depth.   http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/home/antarctic_expedition.html,HER,link

Expedition 33 crew members Suni Williams  Yuri Malenchenko and Aki Hoshide are preparing to undock from the International Space Station aboard their Soyuz TMA-05M spacecraft at 5:26 p.m. EST. NASA Television airing live coverage of undocking beginning at 5 p.m.  http://www.nasa.gov/ntv,HER,status
Expedition 33 Commander Suni Williams ceremonially handed over command of the International Space Station on Saturday to fellow NASA astronaut Kevin Ford on the eve of her departure from the complex along with Aki Hoshide of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and Russian Soyuz Commander Yuri Malenchenko.   Ford  who has served as an Expedition 33 flight engineer since arriving at the station Oct. 25  will become commander of Expedition 34 at the time the Soyuz TMA-05M carrying Williams  Hoshide and Malenchenko undocks from the station Sunday at 5:26 p.m. EST for a landing in the steppe of Kazakhstan several hours later. Their return will wrap up 127 days in space since their launch from Kazakhstan on July 15  including 125 days spent aboard the station.   NASA Television will provide coverage throughout Sunday of the Expedition 33 crew’s departure and landing.   http://www.nasa.gov/ntv,HER,link
Expedition 33 Commander Suni Williams and Flight Engineer Aki Hoshide wrapped up a 6-hour  38-minute spacewalk at 3:07 p.m. EDT Thursday.   During the spacewalk which began at 8:29 a.m.  Williams and Hoshide ventured out to the port side of the International Space Station’s truss to configure the 2B solar array power channel’s photovoltaic thermal control system (PVTCS) to support ground-based troubleshooting of an ammonia leak.   The spacewalking duo isolated the photovoltaic radiator on the P6 truss from the PVTCS  shutting off the flow of ammonia in and out of it and rerouting the ammonia flow through a spare radiator so the PVTCS can continue operation. Over the following weeks and months  flight controllers at Mission Control Houston will monitor telemetry to see if the leak continues.   If rerouting the ammonia through the spare radiator stops the leak  mission managers will evaluate whether to leave the fix as-is or replace the photovoltaic radiator on a future spacewalk. If the leak continues  additional troubleshooting will be required.   Williams now has a total of 50 hours  40 minutes of spacewalking time over seven spacewalks. Thursday's spacewalk puts her fifth on the all time list of cumulative spacewalking time. She holds the record for total cumulative spacewalk time by a female astronaut. This was the third spacewalk for Hoshide  who now totals 21 hours and 23 minutes. He holds the record for total cumulative spacewalk time by a Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency astronaut.   This was the 166th spacewalk in support of station assembly  totaling 1 049 hours and 1 minute -- the equivalent of 44 days.   Wednesday night  thrusters on the ISS Progress 48 cargo ship at the Pirs Docking Compartment were used to raise the station’s altitude in a debris avoidance maneuver to steer clear of a small fragment of debris from the Iridium 33 satellite. Only one set of thrusters on a single manifold was used to execute the reboost at 7:08 p.m. EDT instead of the planned both sets of thrusters on two manifolds  resulting in a slightly reduced altitude change. The single manifold selection was the result of a software configuration  but the burn lasted 10 minutes in duration and was automatically terminated by thruster cut off limits.   Despite the fact that the maneuver achieved only about 72 percent of the planned altitude change  the goal of maneuvering away from the debris was accomplished and no additional maneuver is required.   The reboost increased the station’s altitude by 0.18 statute miles at apogee and 0.49 statute miles at perigee. The station is now orbiting at an altitude of 261.3 x 252.3 statute miles.   http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/living/index.html,HER,link
NASA Television will provide live coverage of the launch and planned same-day rendezvous and docking of a Russian Progress spacecraft from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan to the International Space Station. Coverage begins at 3:15 a.m. EDT. Launch of ISS Progress 49 is planned for 3:41 a.m. (1:41 p.m. Kazakhstan time).  The cargo craft is loaded with 2 050 pounds of propellant  104 pounds of oxygen and air  926 pounds of water and 2 738 pounds of spare parts and experiment hardware for a total of 2.9 tons of food  fuel and equipment to be delivered to the six crew members on the orbital laboratory.  Progress 49 is scheduled to dock later this morning  to the Zvezda service module at 9:40 a.m. EDT. NASA TV coverage of the docking begins at 9 a.m.   Expedition 33 Commander Sunita Williams of NASA and her five crewmates  including NASA astronaut Kevin Ford  will monitor key events during Progress 49's rendezvous and docking.   Russian flight controllers  who executed a single-day launch to docking rendezvous with the Progress 48 craft in August  are gathering data that may be applied for a similar single-day operation for manned Soyuz missions to the station beginning in 2013. They retain the option to revert to a normal two-day rendezvous if developments require. If that occurs  the craft will dock Friday  Nov. 2.

NASA 905  the shuttle carrier aircraft (SCA)  and space shuttle Endeavour scheduled to land at Ellington Field at 10:45 am CDT. The SCA crew will initiate a flyover of various areas of Houston  including downtown  before heading to the Clear Lake area. Public viewing has been extended to 9 p.m. CDT  since the aircraft will remain in Houston for one night rather than two.

After evaluating the weather  managers are planning a Space Shuttle Endeavour Houston stopover on Wednesday  Sept. 19  weather permitting  with departure for California on Thursday  Sept. 20.   Endeavour will be available for public viewing Sept. 19 until 7 p.m. Endeavour will depart Ellington at sunrise Sept. 20 to continue on its way to Los Angeles for permanent display.   On Wednesday  the SCA/Endeavour combo is planned to fly approximately 1 500 feet above various areas of Houston  Clear Lake and Galveston - including JSC -- between about 9 and 10:30 a.m. as it arrives in Houston from the Kennedy Space Center (KSC). Endeavour's Landing at Ellington is set for about 10:45 a.m. The specific route and timing of Endeavour's flight will depend on weather and operational constraints.   NASA also will provide updates on Endeavour's cross-country flight via social media using the hashtags #SpotTheShuttle and #OV105. You can follow who sees Endeavour  and post your sighting  in real time at: http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23spottheshuttle   Stay tuned to this website for updates regarding Endeavour's stop in Houston:   http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/home/endeavour_visit.html,HER,link
Endeavour and the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft are ready to go  but the weather is not. The cold front has slowed and now is not expected to clear Houston in time for a safe arrival Monday at Ellington. So for safety of the vehicle in transit  the plan now shifts one day with a Houston/Ellington stopover including one night with departure for California near sunrise Wednesday.,HER,link

Everything is set at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan for today’s launch of the ISS Progress 48 cargo ship to the International Space Station. Loaded with 1 962 pounds of propellant  110 pounds of oxygen and air  925 pounds of water and 2 817 pounds of supplies  spare parts and experiment hardware  the unpiloted Russian resupply craft is scheduled to lift off from the launch pad at Baikonur at 3:35 p.m. EDT (1:35 a.m. Thursday  Baikonur time) on a novel four-orbit  six-hour expedited transit to the station.   With this launch  Russian officials are testing a modified rendezvous plan designed to reduce the typical two-day flight to the station. If applied to the crewed Soyuz vehicles  this would increase crew comfort and provide for additional contingency time at the end of the spacecraft’s mission.   If all goes as planned  docking by the Progress to the Pirs docking compartment will occur at 9:24 p.m. Russian flight controllers retain the option to revert to a two-day rendezvous if something unexpected occurs in the first three hours  or two orbits  of the mission. In that case  docking would take place late Friday afternoon.   NASA Television coverage of the launch begins at 3:15 p.m.   http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/living/index.html,HER,link

Just as important as the spacecraft NASA sends to explore the solar system is the network of transceivers here at home that let us communicate with them. The new “Uplink-Downlink” game on The Space Place is a fun way to see how it works. The spacecraft are so far away  they might as well be stationary in the sky as Earth turns below. Three different antennas (dish-type radio telescopes) of the Deep Space Network (DSN) pass by one at a time below as Earth turns. Your job in the game is to aim the moving antenna at a spacecraft  transmit a command  then receive 100% of the data sent back from as many as five spacecraft before the game is over. Play “DSN Uplink-Downlink.”,LER,link
Explore the whole solar system!  Next year  2011  is the Year of the Solar System  and we are getting a head start at The Space Place. “Solar System Explorer” is a super-game containing several mini-games. Pick a planet. Or a comet. Or an asteroid. Zoom in and poke around. If it’s a planet with moons  zoom in on one of them and explore even more. And if a spacecraft is already there  or headed there  play a mini-game to help the spacecraft with its mission of exploration. Earn achievements by reading about solar system objects and by playing the games. More mini-games are coming soon. See how high you can push your scores. Post them on your Facebook page.

Clouded out this year? You can still see Geminids! Go to http://fireballs.ndc.nasa.gov and click on the 20121214 or 20121213 links at the left  which will bring up data on the Geminids recorded on those nights.Click on a thumbnail to play the movie of the meteor (requires XVid codec),LER,link
The NASA fireball camera at the Tellus Museum in Cartersville  Georgia caught these nearly simultaneous fireballs at 5:44 AM EDT on May 6. The first is a faint streak just a bit above and to the right of the center of the image; the second - which is much brighter- immediately follows off to the right at the top edge of the clouds. These were not automatically picked up in our other cameras  so we do not have trajectories and cannot definitively identify them as eta Aquarids. However  an overlay of the star field (link below) suggests that they probably are  as the meteors appear to originate from close to the meteor shower radiant (the plus sign labeled ETA).  http://fireballs.ndc.nasa.gov/special/eAQR_2012/dbl_eta_Aqr.jpg,LER,video
The NASA all sky meteor cameras detected 7 Eta Aquarid fireballs last night  6 of them between 3:45 and 4:30 a.m. PDT - a span of only 45 minutes! In this video  an Eta streaks at 152 000 mph above Las Cruces  New Mexico. At such speeds  the half-ounce piece of Halley's Comet lasts only a second before meeting a fiery demise 53 miles above Earth's surface.,LER,video

Update on Lyrid balloon flight  After a 3 hour journey  the meteor payload descended safely via parachute. However  it landed in a remote  hard to reach area of the White Mountains  so it will take time (days) for the recovery team to formulate a plan and get to it.  This is the first time the balloon team has had a payload land in such a tough area. Murphy's Law strikes again!,LER,status
There are more awesome pictures of the balloon (carrying a camera looking for meteors) on NASA Marshall's flickr account. Check it out! http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasamarshall/,LER,link

An update on the balloon cam. "The payload includes the NASA low-light video camera  two GPS trackers  two Hero2 GoPro Cameras and a cryogenic thermometer. We are receiving GPS data from the payload. The balloon is currently ascending over the Sierra Nevada range near Bishop  CA. Launched at 11:53 p.m. PDT. "Coordinates as of 12:09 am. PDT: Latitude=37.31692  Longitude=-118.59526",LER,status

The NASA camera at New Mexico State University captured this -3 magnitude Lyrid as it cut an arc across the sky at 2:26 AM local time.,LER,video
The NASA fireball cameras in New Mexico picked up our first 3 Lyrids last night! They had peak magnitudes of -1.5  -3  and -3 (Mars/Jupiter brightness)  and burned up between 83 and 91 km altitude (51.6 and 56.6 miles in U.S. units); average speed was 46.3 km/sec  or 103 600 mph. You can easily identify the 3 Lyrids in this orbit plot by the similarity of their orbits.,LER,photo

In this photo  Ed Shade  an Engineer at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt  Md. is putting final touches on thermal blankets in a vacuum chamber called the Space Environment Simulator  or SES that is being used to test components of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope.  Shade is laying blanketing on the wires on the floor to keep the heat they create from contaminating the other parts of the testbed. Those blankets are made of aluminized kapton  a polymer film that remains stable over a wide range of temperatures.  Just as blankets insulate people from cold  these golden-colored thermal blankets help prevent heat from seeping into the vacuum chamber that will drop temperatures to mimic those of deep space.  Blankets are also wrapped around pieces of equipment to protect them when they go into the SES. Components of the Webb will ultimately experience the cold of space in their operational orbit over 1 million miles from Earth and are tested in a deep freeze to ensure they will function properly.  The cables and cords seen in the photo are actually ground support equipment that include the Optical Telescope Simulator (OSIM)  for the James Webb Space Telescope. The cables and cords are part of the thermal controls and monitoring that will go on 24 hours a day for the next three months. The entire structure is monitored for thermal fluctuations.  The most powerful space telescope ever built  Webb is the successor to NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. Webb's four instruments will reveal how the universe evolved from the Big Bang to the formation of our solar system. Webb is a joint project of NASA  the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency.   http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/webb-telescope-test-insulating-from-heat-and-cold/#.Ui-KXby3KkF  Credit: Text  Rob Gutro.

Using infrared data from the Subaru Telescope in Hawaii  an international team of astronomers has imaged a giant planet around the bright star GJ 504. Several times the mass of Jupiter and similar in size  the new world  dubbed GJ 504b  is the lowest-mass planet ever detected around a star like the sun using direct imaging techniques.  "If we could travel to this giant planet  we would see a world still glowing from the heat of its formation with a color reminiscent of a dark cherry blossom  a dull magenta " said Michael McElwain  a member of the discovery team at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt  Md. He also adds that  "Studying these systems is a little like seeing our own planetary system in its youth."  http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/astronomers-image-lowest-mass-exoplanet-around-a-sun-like-star/#.UgOyIlO3KkH  Besides observing planetary atmospheres  the infrared James Webb Space Telescope will also carry coronographs to enable photography of exoplanets near bright stars (if they are big and bright and far from the star).

NASA Spitzer - mapping cosmic carbon across the universe! http://www.nasa.gov/topics/universe/features/evolution-of-cosmic-carbon-pah.html  About the image: For the first time  scientists are able to automatically interpret previously unknown infrared emissions from space that come from surprisingly complex organic molecules  called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)  which are abundant and important across the universe. They use spectra of infrared radiation to identify unknown substances in space. These spectra are as good as fingerprints for identification purposes. Analyzing the PAH bands represents a powerful new astronomical tool to trace the evolution of cosmic carbon and  at the same time  probe conditions across the universe.

Pluto's newly discovered moons have been officially named! http://www.iau.org/public_press/news/detail/iau1303/ The James Webb Space Telescope will be able to study the surface chemistry of Pluto  its moons  and many other bodies that lie in the distant Kuiper Belt.  About the image: This discovery image  taken by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope  shows five moons orbiting the distant  icy dwarf planet Pluto. The darker stripe in the centre of the image is because the picture is constructed from a long exposure designed to capture the comparatively faint satellites of Nix  Hydra  Kerberos and Styx  and a shorter exposure to capture Pluto and Charon  which are much brighter. Kerberos has an estimated diameter of 13 to 34 kilometres  and Styx is thought to be irregular in shape and 10 to 25 kilometres across. Credit: NASA  ESA and M. Showalter (SETI Institute),HER,photo

It is located approximately 10 million light-years away in the Cepheus constellation. This image was captured as part of the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxy Survey (SINGS) Legacy Project using the telescope's Infrared Array Camera (IRAC).  The "glowing" red emission reveals regions in the galaxy that are actively forming new stars. The blue dots sprinkled along this image are Milky Way stars along this line of sight.  The SINGS image is a four channel false color composite  where blue indicates emission at 3.6 microns  green corresponds to 4.5 microns  and red to 5.8 and 8.0 microns. The contribution from starlight (measured at 3.6 microns) in this picture has been subtracted from the 5.8 and 8 micron images to enhance the visibility of the dust features."

Practice Makes Perfect With Webb Telescope Mirror Placement  NASA engineers and scientists have been making practice runs to ensure the placement of primary mirror segments on the James Webb Space Telescope go perfectly when the flight equipment is ready. NASA issued a video and photos showing the practice run in the giant clean room at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt  Md.  The video explains and shows how a grey/silver robotic "arm" is used to install the surrogate mirrors onto a test copy of a structure called the telescope "backplane." The surrogate mirror segment is the same mass and hexagonal shape as an actual flight mirror. The test is practice for the placement of the actual flight mirror segments onto the flight telescope structure at a later date.

A Webb in a Golden Cage  This photograph shows support structures wrapped in gold thermal blankets that look like a golden cage. The structure is housed within the vacuum chamber called the Space Environment Simulator  or SES. The SES is located at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt  Md.  where components of the James Webb Space Telescope are being tested to withstand the extreme temperatures of space.  The entire structure is a system of supports and thermal control devices for the series of thermal tests. Visible in the photo is the lower GESHA (Ground Environmental SES Hardware Assembly).The box in the center photo is a group of four LN2 (liquid nitrogen) panels that are designed to keep it at around 100 kelvins. The panels surround the primary mirror of the OTE (Optical Telescope Element) Simulator or OSIM.  When NASA's Webb telescope launches in 2018  it will fly a million miles from Earth and enable scientists on Earth to see the most detailed pictures of the universe.

Infrared light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum - but just like visible light covers a range of different wavelengths (or colors as we see them)  infrared covers a range from near to mid to far infrared.    To illustrate that different infrared wavelengths can give us very different views of an object  here is a look at the Whirlpool galaxy.  (P.S. The James Webb Space Telescope has near and mid-infrared instruments  and combined with a 6.5 meter diameter mirror  will give us spectacular imagery.),HER,photo
How much gold is used to coat Webb's mirrors?  About a golf ball's worth!  Here's the calculation. The thickness of gold coating = 100 x 10^-9 meters (1000 angstroms). Surface area = 25 m^2. Using these numbers plus the density of gold at room temperature (19.3 x 10^-6 g/m^3)  the coating is calculated to use 48.25g of gold  about equal to a golf ball. (A golf ball weighs 45.9 grams.)

We recently answered this question about the timeline after the James Webb Space Telescope launches.  So we added it to our FAQ: http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/faq.html#howdeploy  It's a little bit technical  but here is what happens:  In the first hour: Webb will separate from the Ariane V launch vehicle a half hour after launch and we will deploy the solar array immediately afterward. We will also release several systems that were locked for launch.  In the first day: Two hours after launch we will deploy the high gain antenna. Twelve hours after launch there will be the first trajectory correction maneuver.      In the first week: The second trajectory correction maneuver will take place at 2.5 days after launch. We will start the sequence of major deployment just after that. The first deployments are the fore and aft sunshield pallets  followed by the release of remaining sub-system launch locks. The next deployment is the telescope which is lifted off the spacecraft bus by the deployable tower assembly. The full sunshield deployment can then be initiated. At 6 days we deploy the secondary mirror  followed by the side wings of the primary mirror.  In the first month: As the telescope cools down  we will turn on the warm electronics and initialize the flight software. At the end of the first month  we will do the mid-course correction to ensure that Webb will achieve its final orbit at the second Lagrange point (L2). During the first month the telescope cools to near its operating temperature  but the ISIM is heated to prevent condensation on the instruments.      In the second month: At 33 days after launch we will turn on and operate the Fine Guidance Sensor  then NIRCam and NIRSpec. The first NIRCam image will be of a crowded star field to make sure that light gets through the telescope into the instruments. Since the primary mirror segments will not yet be aligned  the picture will still be out of focus. At 44 days after launch we will begin the process of adjusting the primary mirror segments  first identifying each mirror segment with its image of a star in the camera. We will also focus the secondary mirror.  In the third month: From 60 to 90 days after launch we will align the primary mirror segments so that they can work together as a single optical surface. We will also turn on and operate the MIRI. By the end of the third month we will be able to take the first science-quality images. Also by this time  Webb will complete its initial orbit around L2.  In the fourth through the sixth month: At about 85 days after launch we will have completed the optimization of the telescope image in the NIRCam. Over the next month and a half we will optimize the image for the other instruments. We will test and calibrate all of the instrument capabilities by observing representative science targets.  After six months: Webb will conduct routine science operations.,HER,photo
Here's an answer to a recently asked question. Why are we not building the James Webb Space Telescope on the International Space Station?  In the very earliest stages of feasibility studies NASA examined the possibility of on-orbit assembly for what was then called the next generation space telescope or NGST.  At that time  and still today  the ISS does not have the capability to assemble precision optical structures.  Additionally  the environment around the ISS is not suitable for the exposed optics that JWST has and would have had the possibility to damage or contaminate the optics.  The deployment of Webb happens far above Low Earth Orbit and the debris that resides there.  Finally  if the ISS were used as a stopping point for the observatory we would have needed a second rocket to launch it to its final destination at L2.  The observatory would have to be designed  with much more mass to withstand this “second launch” leaving less mass for the mirrors and science instruments.,HER,photo

The image (on the left) has been posted everywhere today  but we couldn't resist posting it too  because it's so beautiful.  It shows galaxy M106 and was made by renowned astro-photographer Robert Gendler  who took data from the Hubble Space Telescope archive and combined it with his own ground-based observations.    We thought it was interesting to compare it to the image on the right  which is infrared data from Spitzer and X-ray data from Chandra.    Each wavelength gives a different view of the structure of this galaxy.   As Phil Plait notes  "...those red frills  streamers of gas at odd angles to the rest of the galaxy  one each on opposite sides of the galaxy’s core. These are called its anomalous arms  because they don’t line up well at all with M106’s more obvious spiral arms. The red color is a giveaway that we’re seeing gas being warmed by an outside source; hydrogen glows at that color when excited. So what’s the engine behind that?  It turns out  that gas is being zapped by twin blasts of energy coming from material being voraciously consumed by the galaxy’s supermassive central black hole."  Here's a NASA feature on the Gendler's image http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/m106.html  and Phil Plait's blog about the galaxy: http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2013/02/05/spiral_galaxy_m106_a_galaxy_zapped_by_its_own_black_hole.html  Credit (left): NASA  ESA  the Hubble Heritage Team (STScI/AURA)  and R.

"The year brought forth the delivery of two types of flight mirrors  the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI)  the Fine Guidance Sensor and Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (FGS/NIRISS)  and the completion of the center section of the primary mirror backplane. The Webb project modified the historic Chamber A at NASA's Johnson Space Center  Houston  Texas  to enable the Webb telescope’s optics and instrument systems to be tested. In addition to the telescope and test chambers coming together  spinoff technology from the Webb has already been used in industries to improve people's lives.

Another image of our golden secondary mirror!  A Clear Reflection on the Webb Telescope's Secondary Mirror  The sole secondary mirror and another primary mirror that will fly aboard NASA's James Webb Space Telescope arrived at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt  Md. on Nov. 5  2012. In this photo  technicians are inspecting the secondary mirror using flashlights. Reflections of one of the technicians and the roof of the giant clean room that houses the mirror are seen on the mirror's surface.  Unlike the 18 hexagonal primary mirror segments that make up the biggest mirror on the Webb telescope  the secondary mirror is perfectly rounded. The mirror is also convex  so the reflective surface bulges toward a light source. It looks much like a curved mirror that you'll see on the wall near the exit of a parking garage that lets motorists see around a corner.  The mirror is made of beryllium  which was selected for its stiffness  light weight and stability at cryogenic temperatures. Bare beryllium is not very reflective of near-infrared light  so each mirror is coated with gold. The microscopic gold coating enables the secondary mirror to efficiently reflect infrared light (which is what the Webb telescope's cameras see). The quality of the secondary mirror surface is so good that the final convex surface at cold temperatures does not deviate from the design by more than a few millionths of a millimeter - or about one ten thousandth the diameter of a human hair.  Previously on Sept. 17  2012  two other primary mirror segments arrived at NASA Goddard and are currently being stored in the giant clean room on campus. Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. of Boulder  Colo. manufactured the mirrors  packed  and shipped them to NASA Goddard.  The most powerful space telescope ever built  the Webb telescope will provide images of the first galaxies ever formed  and explore planets around distant stars. It is a joint project of NASA  the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency.

Today's image - our beautiful  golden flight secondary mirror!  Webb Telescope's Secondary Mirror Looks Like a Giant Sun  The round  gold coated secondary mirror that will fly aboard NASA's James Webb Space Telescope looks like a giant sun in this photo where technicians at NASA were securing it to a platform. What appears to be a track circling the mirror looks like the orbit a planet would take around the sun. The rounded shipping canister that the housed the mirror actually fit on that rounded "track."  Unlike the 18 hexagonal primary mirror segments that make up the biggest mirror on the Webb telescope  the secondary mirror is perfectly rounded. The mirror is also convex  so the reflective surface bulges toward a light source. It looks much like a curved mirror that you'll see on the wall near the exit of a parking garage that lets motorists see around a corner. This mirror is coated with a microscopic layer of gold to enable it to efficiently reflect infrared light (which is what the Webb telescope's cameras see).  "The thickness of the gold coating on the mirrors is only 100 nanometers thick  or a tenth of a micron  which is 1/10 000th of a millimeter " said Paul Geithner  Deputy Project Manager - Technical for the Webb telescope at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt  Md. "A human hair is roughly 1000 times thicker."  The mirror arrived at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt  Md. on Nov. 5  2012. The mirror previously resided at Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. of Boulder  Colo. who manufactured it.  The Webb telescope is the world’s next-generation space observatory and successor to the Hubble Space Telescope. The most powerful space telescope ever built  the Webb telescope will provide images of the first galaxies ever formed  and explore planets around distant stars.

Over time  the storm has been stretched into the white band seen in the mid northern (upper) latitudes. This view  taken on March 12  2011  shows the late stages of the storm. It was taken using the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on the Hubble Space Telescope  with color data taken from earlier images of a previous storm by the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2). Three moons are visible above Saturn: Dione on the left  and Enceladus and Tethys on the right. Another speck at lower right is not a moon.

We were recently asked how long the James Webb Space Telescope would take to get to its future home at the 2nd Lagrange point.  Here's the answer.  Webb's solar panel is deployed about 1/2 hour after launch to provide power for the mission. The rest of the deployments take place in the next 4 days en route to L2. Webb will arrive in the vicinity of L2 in 30 days and will get into final orbit by 90 days.,HER,photo

New photo feature!  Taking COCOA Cryo  Testing of the James Webb Space Telescope's Center of Curvature Optical Assembly  or COCOA  recently was completed in the X-ray and Cryogenic Test Facility at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville  Ala. The optical assembly was operated in a vacuum at both room temperature and cryogenic -- or deep cold -- temperatures to certify its performance before it is used to test the performance of Webb’s 21.3 foot primary mirror. COCOA's operation and performance must be verified alone before it can be used to test Webb under conditions that the observatory will experience in space.  The Webb telescope includes 18 six-sided mirror segments  which work together to form one large  21.3-foot mirror.  COCOA was built by ITT Exelis of Rochester  N.Y.  and its subcontractor Micro Instruments in Rochester  N.Y.  The James Webb Space Telescope is the world’s next-generation space observatory and successor to the Hubble Space Telescope. The most powerful space telescope ever built  the Webb telescope will provide images of the first galaxies ever formed  and will explore planets around distant stars. It is a joint project of NASA  the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency.   http://www.nasa.gov/topics/technology/features/cocoa.html  Credit: NASA Marshall,HER,photo

NASA's Cleanroom Receives the Webb Mirrors  The first two mirrors that will fly aboard NASA's James Webb Space Telescope arrived at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt  Md. and were wheeled into NASA's giant clean room in this photo.   Each of the two mirrors are in their own shipping canister. The canisters will be opened  and the mirrors will be removed and checked. The mirrors await assembly onto the telescope structure.  The mirrors were manufactured  packed and shipped by Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. of Boulder  Colo.    The powerful primary mirrors of the James Webb Space Telescope will be able to detect the light from distant galaxies.  The Webb telescope has 21 mirrors  with 18 primary mirror segments working together as one large 21.3-foot (6.5-meter) primary mirror. The mirror segments are made of beryllium  which was selected for its stiffness  light weight and stability at cryogenic temperatures. Bare beryllium is not very reflective of near-infrared light  so each mirror is coated with about 0.12 ounce of gold.  The Webb telescope is the world’s next-generation space observatory and successor to the Hubble Space Telescope. The most powerful space telescope ever built  the Webb telescope will provide images of the first galaxies ever formed  and explore planets around distant stars.

The Webb Telescope's 'Golden Spider':   What looks like a giant golden spider weaving a web of cables and cords  is actually ground support equipment  including the Optical Telescope Simulator (OSIM)  for the James Webb Space Telescope. OSIM's job is to generate a beam of light just like the one that the real telescope optics will feed into the actual flight instruments. Because the real flight instruments will be used to test the real flight telescope  their alignment and performance first have to be verified by using the OSIM. Engineers are thoroughly checking out OSIM now in preparation for using it to test the flight science instruments later.

Here's another image for our "Infrared is beautiful" theme. This image of a nebula actually combines infrared data from Spitzer with data from Hubble and Chandra. Here's a full caption for you:  "This composite of 30 Doradus  aka the Tarantula Nebula  contains data from Chandra (blue)  Hubble (green)  and Spitzer (red). Located in the Large Magellanic Cloud  the Tarantula Nebula is one of the largest star-forming regions close to the Milky Way. Chandra's X-rays detect gas that has been heated to millions of degrees by stellar winds and supernovas. This high-energy stellar activity creates shock fronts  which are similar to sonic booms. Hubble reveals the light from massive stars at various stages of star birth  while Spitzer shows where the relatively cooler gas and dust lie."

A hundred years ago  scientists did not know that stars are powered by nuclear fusion  and 50 years ago they did not know that stars are continually forming in the Universe.  Researchers still do not know the details of how clouds of gas and dust collapse to form stars  or why most stars form in groups  or exactly how planetary systems form. Webb's superior imaging and spectroscopy capabilities will allow us to study stars as they are forming in their dusty cocoons. It will also be able to image disks around stars and study organic molecules that are important for life to develop.

Close cousins?  Comparison between Earth and Kepler-452b and their host stars  Scientists using data from NASA's Kepler mission have confirmed the first near-Earth-size planet orbiting in the habitable zone of a sun-like star. The habitable zone is the region around a star where temperatures are just right for water to exist in its liquid form.  The artistic concept compares Earth (left) to the new planet  called Kepler-452b  which is about 60 percent larger. The illustration represents one possible appearance for Kepler-452b -- scientists do not know whether the planet has oceans and continents like Earth.  Both planets orbit a G2-type star of about the same temperature; however  the star hosting Kepler-452b is 6 billion years old  1.5 billion years older than our sun. As stars age  they become larger  hotter and brighter  as represented in the illustration. Kepler-452b's star appears a bit larger and brighter.  Image credit: NASA Ames/JPL-Caltech/T. Pyle & W.

Over the holidays at the end of 1992  Lloyd Robinson  the CCD guru at UCO Lick in those days  had just retired and offered to set up a CCD system in the clean room in Santa Cruz to see what could be learned.  This star plate was a key component in that original setup.    When Jon Jenkins (Co-Investigator and Analysis Lead for Kepler) first set eyes on this plate in June  2010  he recognized it immediately  even though he had never seen it before. This was because one of his first tasks for the mission was the analysis of an untold number of images from a variety of tests using this plate. These tests were invaluable in discovering all sorts of ways for test setups to go wrong  from sagging light bulb filaments to liquid nitrogen fills. Based on what was learned  more sophisticated laboratory test systems were developed using a variety of other star plates. This painstaking laboratory work culminated in the very successful Kepler Test Demonstration (KTD)  which was instrumental in selling the Kepler Mission to NASA.

Johannes Kepler 439th birthday is coming [December  27]  and we're here planning the best way to celebrate the event. One of the ideas we had already outlined was to establish a human link between the astronomer and the mission named after him (yes  that's us...).  This could be achieved by finding a direct descendant.  A step further towards this goal was taken due to Heidi Comstock’s comment on a previous status update: “Does anyone have an accurate Johannes Kepler genealogy leading to present day via any Kepler branch?”  To deliver a gift from the mission to a descendant of the astronomer on the occasion of his birthday. This is where we are aiming at. Start searching!

The exoplanet upsilon Andromeda b is thought to be tidally locked so that the same hemisphere always faces the star it orbits.  However  astronomers reported today that the planet's surface appears to be brightest about 80 degrees away from the star-facing hemisphere.  This unexpected result is based on 5 days (about the time it takes for ups And b to make one orbit) of data taken with the Spitzer Space Telescope.  It'll be interesting to see if this behavior persists!  That might have to happen with different instruments.  These data were taken before Spitzer ran out of cryogen.,LER,link

Although Deimos and Phobos  Mars' moons  were not discovered until 1877  Swift wrote in 1720  in Gulliver's Travels  that the inhabitants of Laputa had made important astronomical observations including the two satellites of Mars  one orbiting with a period 10 hours and the other with a period of 21 hours. All sorts of theories appeared to explain the amazing coincidence. That Mars should have two satellites was an old idea  which Kepler had expressed in 1610 and others had elaborated further. But guessing the periods and distances of Deimos and Phobos to within 30% is a less likely coincidence. Will we ever know how?,LER,link

[Know more] The habitable zone is the distance from a star where one can have liquid water on the surface of a planet. If a planet is too close to its parent star  it will be too hot and water would have evaporated. If a planet is too far from a star it is too cold and water is frozen. Stars come in a wide variety of sizes  masses and temperatures. Stars that are smaller  cooler and lower mass than the Sun (M-dwarfs) have their habitable zone much closer to the star than the Sun (G-dwarf). Stars that are larger  hotter and more massive than the Sun (A-dwarfs) have their habitable zone much farther out from the star.,LER,link

Astronomers Find Dark Matter Even Darker  Astronomers using observations from NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope and Chandra X-ray Observatory have found that dark matter interacts with itself even less than previously thought by researchers. This finding narrows down the options for what this mysterious substance might be.  This collage shows images of six different galaxy clusters taken with NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope and Chandra X-ray Observatory. The clusters were observed in a study of how dark matter in clusters of galaxies behaves when the clusters collide. Seventy-two large cluster collisions were studied in total.  Using visible-light images from Hubble  the team was able to map the post-collision distribution of stars and also of the dark matter (colored in blue)  which was traced through its gravitational lensing effects on background light. Chandra was used to see the X-ray emission from impacted gas (pink).  The team determined that dark matter interacts with itself and everything else even less than previously thought.  The clusters shown here are  from left to right and top to bottom: MACS J0416.1–2403  MACS J0152.5-2852  MACS J0717.5+3745  Abell 370  Abell 2744  and ZwCl 1358+62.

NASA’s Hubble Observations Suggest Underground Ocean on Jupiter’s Largest Moon  NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope has the best evidence yet for an underground saltwater ocean on Ganymede  Jupiter’s largest moon. The subterranean ocean is thought to have more water than all the water on Earth’s surface.  Identifying liquid water is crucial in the search for habitable worlds beyond Earth and for the search of life as we know it.  “This discovery marks a significant milestone  highlighting what only Hubble can accomplish ” said John Grunsfeld  assistant administrator of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters  Washington. “In its 25 years in orbit  Hubble has made many scientific discoveries in our own solar system. A deep ocean under the icy crust of Ganymede opens up further exciting possibilities for life beyond Earth.”  Ganymede is the largest moon in our solar system and the only moon with its own magnetic field. The magnetic field causes aurorae  which are ribbons of glowing  hot electrified gas  in regions circling the north and south poles of the moon. Because Ganymede is close to Jupiter  it is also embedded in Jupiter’s magnetic field. When Jupiter’s magnetic field changes  the aurorae on Ganymede also change  “rocking” back and forth.  By watching the rocking motion of the two aurorae  scientists were able to determine that a large amount of saltwater exists beneath Ganymede’s crust affecting its magnetic field.

Though the universe is full of such colliding galaxies that are distorted in a gravitational taffy-pull  NGC 7714 is particularly striking for the seeming fluidity of the stars along a vast arc. The near-collision between the galaxies happened at least 100 million years ago.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2015/04,HER,photo
Picture Post: This is a near-infrared view of yesterday's new Hubble image of the Eagle Nebula's "Pillars of Creation."

Latest News: The largest #Hubble image ever assembled  this sweeping view of a portion of the Andromeda galaxy is the sharpest large composite image ever taken of our galactic next-door neighbor. Though the galaxy is over 2 million light-years away  the Hubble telescope is powerful enough to resolve individual stars. And  there are lots of stars in this image — over 100 million  with some of them in thousands of star clusters seen embedded in the disk.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2015/02/  #aas225,HER,photo
Latest News: #Hubble launches its 25th anniversary celebration with new look at iconic “Pillars of Creation” image of the Eagle Nebula. The famous image was first released in 1995. This more-detailed depiction  captured by an instrument installed on the telescope in 2009  includes streamers of gas floating away from the columns and a jet-like feature that may have been ejected from a newborn star.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2015/01/  #aas225,HER,photo
Latest News: Astronomers using #NASA's #Hubble Space Telescope have completed the largest and most sensitive visible-light imaging survey of dusty debris disks around other stars. These dusty disks  likely created by collisions between leftover objects from planet formation  were imaged around stars as young as 10 million years old and as mature as more than 1 billion years old.  Once thought to be simply pancake-like structures  the unexpected diversity and complexity of these dusty debris structures strongly suggest they are being gravitationally affected by unseen planets orbiting the star. Alternatively  these effects could result from the stars' passing through interstellar space.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2014/44/,HER,photo
Latest News: Astronomers have found an unlikely object in an improbable place: a monster black hole lurking inside one of the tiniest galaxies known. The dwarf galaxy containing the black hole  as illustrated in this artist's concept  is the densest galaxy ever seen  cramming 140 million stars within a diameter of about 300 light-years (just 1/500th of our Milky Way galaxy's diameter). However  the black hole inside the galaxy is five times the mass of the black hole at the center of our Milky Way. This suggests that the dwarf galaxy may actually be the stripped remnant of a larger galaxy that was torn apart during a close encounter with a more massive galaxy. The finding implies that there are many other compact galaxies in the universe that contain supermassive black holes. http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2014/41,HER,photo

Happy 24th anniversary to the #Hubble Space Telescope! This colorful mosaic of a small portion of the Monkey Head Nebula unveils a collection of carved knots of gas and dust silhouetted against glowing gas.

This light-year-long knot of interstellar gas and dust resembles a caterpillar on its way to a feast. But the meat of the story is not only what this cosmic caterpillar eats for lunch  but also what's eating it. Harsh winds from extremely bright stars are blasting ultraviolet radiation at this "wanna-be" star and sculpting the gas and dust into its long shape.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2013/35/,HER,photo
Latest News: What looks like a celestial hummingbird is really the result of a collision between a spiral and an elliptical galaxy 326 million light- years away. The flat disk of the spiral NGC 2936 is warped into the profile of a bird by the gravitational tug of the companion NGC 2937. The object was first cataloged as a "peculiar galaxy" by Halton Arp in the 1960s. This interacting galaxy duo is collectively called Arp 142.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2013/23/,HER,photo

Picture Post: This image is from a seven-day-long survey conducted in 2006 called the Sagittarius Window Eclipsing Extrasolar Planet Search (SWEEPS). Hubble peered at and obtained information for 180 000 stars in the crowded central bulge of our galaxy  26 000 light-years away. The survey was intended to find hot Jupiter-class planets that orbit very close to their stars. But the SWEEPS team also uncovered 42 oddball blue stars among the bulge population with brightness and temperatures typical for stars much younger than ordinary bulge stars.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/star/2011/16/,HER,photo
Latest News: New observations by #Hubble reveal a new twist on the Ring Nebula. The images show a more complex structure than astronomers once thought.  "The nebula is not like a bagel  but rather  it's like a jelly doughnut  because it's filled with material in the middle " said C. Robert O'Dell of Vanderbilt University in Nashville  Tenn. "With Hubble's detail  we see a completely different shape than what's been thought about historically for this classic nebula. The new Hubble observations show the nebula in much clearer detail  and we see things are not as simple as we previously thought."  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2013/13/,HER,photo
Picture Post: These Hubble snapshots capture merging galaxies at various stages in their collision. Astronomers estimate that only one out of one thousand galaxies in the nearby universe is in the act of colliding. However  galaxy mergers were much more common long ago when they were closer together  because the expanding universe was smaller.   For all their violence  galactic smash-ups take place at a glacial rate by human standards - timescales on the order of several hundred million years.   http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2008/16/,HER,photo
Latest News: Hubble has found the building blocks for Earth-sized planets in an unlikely place  the atmospheres of a pair of burned-out stars called white dwarfs. The dwarfs are being polluted by asteroid-like debris falling onto them. This discovery suggests that rocky planet assembly is common in stars. The image is an artist's interpretation of a white dwarf accreting rocky debris.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2013/18/,HER,photo
Picture Post: An eerie pillar of star birth in the Carina Nebula rises from a sea of greenish-colored clouds. Nestled inside this dense structure are fledgling stars. They cannot be seen in this image because they are hidden by a wall of gas and dust. Although the stars themselves are invisible  one of them is providing evidence of its existence. Thin puffs of material can be seen traveling to the left and to the right of a dark notch in the center of the pillar. The matter is part of a jet produced by a young star. Farther away  on the left  the jet is visible as a grouping of small  wispy clouds. A few small clouds are visible at a similar distance on the right side of the jet. Astronomers estimate that the jet is moving at speeds of up to 850 000 miles an hour. The jet's total length is about 10 light-years.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/solar%20system/2009/25/image/h/,HER,photo

Latest News: Hubble images of a vast debris disk encircling the nearby star Fomalhaut  and of a mysterious planet circling it  may provide forensic evidence of a titanic planetary disruption in the system. Astronomers are surprised to find that the debris belt is wider than previously known  spanning a gulf of space from 14 billion miles to nearly 20 billion miles from the star. Even more surprisingly  the latest Hubble images indicate that the planet follows an unusual elliptical orbit on a potentially destructive path through the vast dust ring.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2013/01/,HER,photo

Welcome to a Week of Hubble Art on Facebook. Each day we're posting an artist's illustration that depicts a discovery from one of Hubble's news releases. Enjoy!  This planet  estimated to be at least seven times Jupiter's mass  was originally discovered in images taken with the Keck and Gemini North telescopes in 2007 and 2008. It is the outermost of three massive planets known to orbit the dusty young star HR 8799  which is 130 light-years away. Astronomers combing though years of archived Hubble data were able to identify this planet  which went undiscovered in Hubble images taken in 1998.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2009/15/full/,HER,photo

Picture Post: Stephan's Quintet  also known as Hickson Compact Group 92  is a group of five galaxies. The name  however  is a bit of a misnomer. Studies have shown that group member NGC 7320  at upper left  is actually a foreground galaxy about seven times closer to Earth than the rest of the group.  Three of the galaxies have distorted shapes  elongated spiral arms  and long  gaseous tidal tails containing myriad star clusters  proof of their close encounters. These interactions have sparked a frenzy of star birth in the central pair of galaxies. This drama is being played out against a rich backdrop of faraway galaxies.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2009/2009/25/image/x/,HER,photo

Latest News: Two very different galaxies drift through space together in a peculiar galaxy pair called Arp 116.  Arp 116 is composed of a giant elliptical galaxy known as Messier 60 (or M60) and a much smaller spiral galaxy  NGC 4647.  M60 is the third brightest galaxy in the Virgo cluster of galaxies  a collection of more than 1 300 galaxies. M60 has a diameter of 120 000 light-years  and a mass of about one trillion times that of the Sun. A huge black hole of 4.5 billion solar masses lies at its center  one of the most massive black holes ever found.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2012/38/image/a/,HER,photo

The bending of light by a lens or by the atmosphere is an example of refraction  and is due to the change of the speed of light as it moves from one medium to another  such as from air to glass  or through air which is gradually changing in density. This behavior is an example of "the principle of least action " or in the special case of light  "the principle of least time " which means that the path taken by a ray of light is the path that can be traversed in the least time. http://hte.si.edu/light.html  #HTEscience,LER,photo

Dryden pilot Neil Armstrong is seen here next to the X-15 ship #1 (56-6670) after a research flight.  Armstrong made his first X-15 flight on November 30  1960  in the #1 X-15. He made his second flight on December 9  1960  in the same aircraft. This was the first X-15 flight to use the ball nose  which provided accurate measurement of air speed and flow angle at supersonic and hypersonic speeds. The servo-actuated ball nose can be seen in this photo in front of Armstrong's right hand.  The X-15 employed a non-standard landing gear. It had a nose gear with two tires  but the main landing consisted of skids mounted at the rear of the vehicle. In the photo  the left skid is visible  as are marks on the lakebed from both skids. Because of the skids  the rocket-powered aircraft could only land on a dry lakebed  not on a concrete runway.  1960 NASA Photo / NASA photo  #NASAArmstrong #ThisisArmstrong,HER,photo
This #ThrowbackThursday is for all of you Trekkies out there! Pictured here are Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry and some of the principle television cast in front of the Space Shuttle Enterprise at the dedication ceremony on September 17th  1976.  Enterprise was originally planned to be named Constitution and unveiled on Constitution Day (September 17th). However  a letter-writing campaign by Trekkies to the White House changed that when they asked that the orbiter be named after the Starship Enterprise  featured on the television show Star Trek.   Although the Enterprise never flew in space  it was used to test critical phases of landing and other aspects of shuttle preparations. The shuttle was mounted on top of a modified 747 airliner and released over the dry lakebed at Edwards Air Force Base  California to prove it could glide and land safely.

#FlashbackFriday #fbf  The X-3 Stiletto pictured sitting on the lakebed at Edwards Air Force Base in 1954.    The X-3 had the most unusual pilot entry mode of any X-plane: the seat descended beneath the fuselage like an elevator  and once the pilot was seated  he and the seat rose back into the fuselage for flight.  The X-3 was a single-place jet aircraft with a slender fuselage and a long tapered nose  manufactured by the Douglas Aircraft Company. The X-3's primary mission was to investigate the design features of an aircraft suitable for sustained supersonic speeds  which included the first use of titanium in major airframe components.

We lost contact with STEREO-B (Solar and Terrestrial Relations Observatory) in October 2014. Read about our plan to get it back:  The two #STEREO #spacecraft  launched in October 2006  were originally designed to complete a two-year mission  ending in 2008. But—like many #NASA spacecraft—they lasted much longer. The long lives of the two STEREO spacecraft  now nine years old  have been a boon for scientists studying the sun and its influence throughout the solar system.   The two STEREOs slowly drifted away from Earth as they orbited the sun  one ahead and one behind our home planet  giving scientists constantly-improving views of the sun’s far side  allowing us for the first time to see the whole sun at once.

Macquarie’s Big History Institute offers a different perspective - featuring StarTalk friend and guest host David Grinspoon  A three-day conference at Macquarie University will thrash out #Earth’s latest existential crisis by looking at it from a variety of disciplinary angles — including quantum physics  economics and planetary science — and taking a big history perspective.  The gathering  staged by Macquarie’s Big History Institute  will consider the #Anthropocene — an increasingly popular term for the human-dominated geological epoch — and its struggles with climate change  health and population.  “We teach #history of the #universe ” says the institute’s director  David Christian. “You might think humans simply vanish on that scale. In one sense they do — we’re a recent species on an obscure planet around a very average #star.  “But this story helps you understand how the universe got more and more complex  and what (makes) us humans behave as no species has acted in four billion years. This is a very odd moment  and you cannot really appreciate how odd until you pan right back and place today’s world in this much larger context of a science-based universal history.”  US astrobiologist David Grinspoon  who addresses the conference on Friday  suspects #alien civilisations have faced similar moments. But we’ll never know unless they came out the other side.  If they didn’t  their signature in the cosmic record will have been too fleeting for us to notice. “If we become aware of their presence  they will have been doing this thing we’re attempting to do — living with planet-changing technology — much longer than we have ” he says.  Success will have made them virtually immortal  harnessing their technological capabilities to survive meteor strikes or control the climate to their advantage. “If (alien civilisations) achieved a mature relationship with technology  they should be out there.”  Christian says big history can help humans achieve the same goal  or survive climate change at any rate. “It’s very hard to get an overview of large complex problems that cut across disciplines ” he says.  “But all the big problems of the Anthropocene are exactly like that. You have to understand some economics  some chemistry  some geology to begin to get your brain around them. I don’t think you can understand it just within history or even just within ecology. You need to see how all these disciplines link together.”  Article from The Australian (Photo credit: John Ross) #astrobiology,LER,photo

On Dec. 13–14  1962  Joseph Kittinger and William White  an #astronomer  flew a gondola suspended beneath an 85-meter-diameter Mylar #balloon to a height of 25 000 m over New Mexico. In addition to obtaining telescopic observations from above 95% of Earth's atmosphere  the flight provided valuable data for the development of pressure suits and associated life support systems during a 13-hour stay at the edge of space.  The balloon that supported the Stargazer capsule was a 280-foot diameter sphere of Mylar film; however  at launch only a comparatively small bubble of helium gas occupied the top of the balloon with the remainder of the balloon envelope dangling beneath. As the balloon rose  the gas expanded  filling the balloon until at maximum altitude  it was completely filled and reshaped the envelope into a sphere. The gondola was supported below the balloon on a cable giving a total height at takeoff of approximately 400 feet.  via The Worlds of David Darling  (Images attributed to: www.daviddarling.info and Jack Gruber/USA Today),LER,photo

Cassini spacecraft is monitoring the evolution of a mysterious feature in a large hydrocarbon sea on Titan. The feature covers an area of about 100 square miles (260 square kilometers) in Ligeia Mare  one of the largest seas on Titan. It has now been observed twice by Cassini's radar experiment  but its appearance changed between the two apparitions.  These three images  created from Cassini Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data  show the appearance and evolution of a mysterious feature in Ligeia Mare  one of the largest hydrocarbon seas on Saturn's moon Titan. The views  taken during three different Cassini flybys of Titan  show that this feature was not visible in earlier radar images of the same region and its appearance changed between 2013 and 2014.

CSI Cassini - The case of the F ring moonlet disappearance. Prime suspect: Prometheus!  Case: http://go.nasa.gov/1lRdeNJ Exhibits:  http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA15505  Case in point: Saturn's narrow  chaotic and clumpy F ring. A recent NASA-funded study compared the F ring's appearance in six years of observations by the Cassini mission to its appearance during the Saturn flybys of NASA's Voyager mission  30 years earlier.   The study team found that  while the overall number of clumps in the F ring remained the same  the number of exceptionally bright clumps of material plummeted during that time. While the Voyagers saw two or three bright clumps in any given observation  Cassini spied only two of the features during a six-year period. What physical processes  they wondered  could cause only the brightest of these features to decline sharply? Find out here: http://go.nasa.gov/1lRdeNJ,HER,photo
Pan maintains the Encke Gap in Saturn's A ring by gravitationally nudging the ring particles back into the rings when they stray.

Icy Aquifers on Titan Transform Methane Rainfall - A recent study examined how Titan's methane rainfall would interact with icy materials within underground reservoirs. The formation of materials called clathrates changes the chemical composition of the rainfall runoff that charges these hydrocarbon "aquifers." This process leads to the formation of reservoirs of propane and ethane that may feed into some rivers and lakes.

Titan's building blocks might pre-date Saturn. Nitrogen in the atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan originated in conditions similar to the cold birthplace of the most ancient comets from the Oort cloud. The main implication of this new research is that Titan's building blocks formed early in the solar system's history  in the cold disk of gas and dust that formed the sun.

For Cassini's radio science team  the last flyby of Titan  on May 17  was one of the most scientifically valuable encounters of the spacecraft's current extended mission - using radio signals to explore the physical nature of Titan's vast northern seas and probe the high northern regions of its substantial atmosphere.  The Cassini team hopes to replicate the technical success of that flyby during the T-102 encounter today  during which the spacecraft will attempt similar measurements of Titan. (It's happening right now  btw)  More about the flybys: http://go.nasa.gov/1oFQocY,HER,photo
The next Titan T102 flyby is on Wednesday June 18!  Cassini's Radio Science (RSS) Instrument will carry out a maneuver in which it passes its signal through the atmosphere of Titan and back to the Deep Space Network (DSN) stations on Earth until the signal is fully blocked (occulted) by Titan itself.

Here's a view toward the sunlit side of the rings revealing Atlas emerging from Saturn's shadow.   Wondering about the bright spot in the ring? Is it a jet or a clump?  We asked Cassini scientist Dr. Carl Murray  who replied "I would classify it as a "mini-jet" rather than an example of a "jet" that we sometimes see. They are both the product of collisions of small objects with the core of the F ring. These small objects orbit close to the core and occasionally collide with it. If the relative velocity is large enough then a larger "jet" is produced.  In this image the original "mini-jet" has sheared quite a bit -- if you look closely and change the contrast you can see a faint continuation of the "mini-jet" almost parallel to the core.  This much shear means that the collision probably happened a few days before the image was taken."  Thanks Dr. Carl Murray for the great answer!

Ten years ago today! Phoebe flyby! #Cassini10 Just weeks before Saturn Orbit Insertion  Cassini made its first targeted flyby -- of the moon Phoebe -- on June 11  2004. Cassini passed Phoebe  the largest of Saturn's outer or "irregular" moons  at an altitude of just 1 285 miles (2 068 kilometers). This was the only close flyby of one of the outer moons of Saturn in the entire Cassini mission.   The image on the left side shows Cassini's view on approach to Phoebe  while the right side shows the spacecraft's departing perspective.   Phoebe is thought to be a captured object that does not share a joint origin with Saturn and the inner  "regular" satellites. The prevailing view is that Phoebe might have formed in the Kuiper Belt  far beyond the orbit of Saturn. It might thus be a small cousin of the largest Kuiper Belt object  Pluto.

Happy birthday Giovanni Domenico Cassini  born on this day  June 8  1625 in the comune of Perinaldo in the Most Serene Republic of Genoa  now part of Italy.  Cassini discovered four moons of Saturn - Iapetus (1671)  Rhea (1672)  Tethys (1684)  and Dione (1684). In 1675  he discovered that Saturn's rings are separated into two parts by a gap  which is now called Cassini Division in his honor.  He also was the first director of the Paris Observatory  measured the sun's apparent motion through the sky  and even approximated the distance from the Earth to the Sun. In addition  he used the shadows of Jupiter's moons and shadows on Jupiter's surface to determine the length of Jupiter's day  and he is also credited with discovering Jupiter's Great Red Spot!,HER,photo

NASA Ames Research Center scientists working with Cassini data have developed a new way to understand the atmospheres of exoplanets by using smog-enshrouded Titan as a stand-in.

Another first! Another pale blue dot. Cassini's first-ever image of the pale blue ice-giant planet Uranus in the distance beyond Saturn's rings. (upper left of photo)  The robotic spacecraft briefly turned its gaze away from the ringed beauty of Saturn on April 11  2014  to observe the distant planet  which is the seventh planet from the sun.  This view was acquired by the Cassini narrow-angle camera at a distance of approximately 614 300 miles (988 600 kilometers) from Saturn on April 11  2014. Image scale at Uranus is approximately 16 000 miles (25 700 kilometers) per pixel. Image scale at Saturn's rings is approximately 4 miles (6 kilometers) per pixel. In the image  the disk of Uranus is just barely resolved. The solar phase angle at Uranus  seen from Cassini  is 11.9 degrees.  In addition to its aesthetic appeal  Cassini's view of Uranus also serves a practical purpose. Scientists working on several of Cassini's science investigations expect that they will be able to use images and spectra from these observations to help calibrate their own instruments.,HER,photo

Cassini has detected propylene  a chemical used to make food-storage containers  car bumpers and other consumer products  on Saturn's moon Titan.  This is the first definitive detection of the plastic ingredient on any moon or planet  other than Earth.  More at: http://go.nasa.gov/1eULpiu,HER,photo
Cassini instruments provide complementary information about the structure of Saturn's rings. Narrow and wide angle cameras provide images here much like a digital camera does. Radio and stellar occultations of the rings also provide important information about ring structure  but only along a one-dimensional track through the rings.   This image compares structure of Saturn's rings observed by these two approaches. More info at: http://go.nasa.gov/1606DXh,HER,photo
Although the sun is on the other side of Saturn in this dramatic image  some sunlight scatters through the uppermost part of the atmosphere to reach the Cassini spacecraft's cameras.  Light passing through the atmosphere creates the bright arc seen from the top to the bottom of the image. The presence of the Cassini Division is illustrated in the small bit of scattered light it has allowed through near the bottom of the image. http://go.nasa.gov/1h2eR2I,HER,photo
CASSINI WEEKLY IMAGE: By the Pale Saturn-light  Enceladus's plume is only easily visible when Cassini and the Sun are on opposite sides of Enceladus. So what's lighting up the moon then?   It's light reflected off Saturn. This lighting trick allows the Cassini spacecraft to capture both the back-lit plume and the surface of Enceladus in one shot . . . http://go.nasa.gov/19tz1zE,HER,photo

Titan Flyby T-94: A Fresh Look at Northern Lakes  During T-94  Cassini instruments will acquire images of Punga Mare (a first!) and of the smaller lakes in the surrounding area. These views will be compared to earlier images to provide information about seasonal variations. Cassini will also look at clouds to follow the evolution of the cloud system over the poles  particularly over the north pole to monitor the evolution of the cloud system as Titan approaches summer solstice.

CASSINI WEEKLY IMAGE: Arc Across the Heavens  The sunlit side of Saturn' rings from about 17 degrees above the ringplane.  http://go.nasa.gov/14yWjGV,HER,photo
This stunning false-color view of Saturn's moon Hyperion reveals crisp details across the strange  tumbling moon's surface. Differences in color could represent differences in the composition of surface materials.   The view was obtained during Cassini's very close flyby on Sept. 26  2005. Images taken using infrared  green and ultraviolet spectral filters were combined to create this view. The image scale is 362 meters (1 200 feet) per pixel.

Two Looks at the Turbulent Saturn Storm September 3  2013    Images:  http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/photos/imagedetails/index.cfm?imageId=4883  This set of images shows the turbulent power of a monster Saturn storm. The visible-light image in the back  obtained on Feb. 25  2011  by the imaging camera  shows the turbulent clouds churning across the face of Saturn. The inset infrared image  obtained a day earlier  by Cassini's visual and infrared mapping spectrometer  shows the dredging up of water and ammonia ices from deep in Saturn's atmosphere. This was the first time water ice was detected in Saturn's atmosphere. The storm  first detected by Cassini's radio and plasma wave subsystem in December 2011  churned around the planet in a band around 33 degrees north.,HER,photo
Ligeia Mare  shown here in a false-color image  is one of the many seas and lakes that bejewel Titan's north polar region. Ligeia Mare is filled with liquid hydrocarbons  such as ethane and methane . . . http://go.nasa.gov/1aRuv2q,HER,photo

CASSINI WEEKLY IMAGE: Earhart in the A Ring  Cassini scientists continue their quest to understand the origin and evolution of the newly discovered features observed in Saturn's A ring which have become known as "propellers." In this image  the propeller which scientists have dubbed "Earhart" (at the lower left of the image) has been re-acquired. Scientists hope to understand how the bodies which generate the features -- themselves too small to be seen  yet significantly larger than a typical ring particle -- move around the ring over time.  . . . http://go.nasa.gov/17EHP4K,HER,photo
Since Saturn is tiled on its axis just like Earth is  it has seasons. But where seasons on Earth last three months  on Saturn they last about seven years. These majestic images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope show the rings as their inclination changed from 1996 to 2000. Each year until 2016  Saturn's rings will be increasingly apparent after appearing nearly edge-on in 2009.

CASSINI WEEKLY IMAGE: Going Rogue? Although Epimetheus appears to be orbiting between the A and F rings in this image  it's just an illusion! Epimetheus  which orbits Saturn well outside of the F ring's orbit  is actually on the near side of Saturn to Cassini while the rings seen here are on the far side of the planet. Whew  that's a relief! http://go.nasa.gov/14pbHz6,HER,photo
BLOG: Dance of the Ice Crystals  Since July 19  when Cassini positioned itself in Saturn's shadow and began gathering data from this rare vantage point  ring scientists such as myself have been poring over the streams of data coming back. We're waiting – as you all are -- to see the full mosaic of the Saturn system stitched together by the imaging team  but in the mean time . . . http://go.nasa.gov/15LVzLP,HER,photo
CASSINI WEEKLY IMAGE: Stormy North. The weather forecast for Saturn's north pole: storms. Lots and lots of storms.  Saturn's north polar hexagon contains myriad storms of various sizes  not the least of which is the remarkable and imposing vortex situated over the planet's north pole . . .  http://go.nasa.gov/13ACxsk,HER,photo
This false-color mosaic captures Saturn in nighttime and daytime conditions. The northern hemisphere is about twice as bright as the southern hemisphere. This is because high-level  fine particles are about half as prevalent in the northern hemisphere as in the south. These particles block Saturn's glow more strongly  making Saturn look brighter in the north . . . http://go.nasa.gov/1eh3lz4,HER,photo
Cassini data suggest Saturn's gravity turns Enceladus' jets 'on' and 'off' like adjustable garden hose nozzles . . . http://go.nasa.gov/1ebKWUg  More on Enceladus  . . .  http://go.nasa.gov/nhcbpJ,HER,photo

While we wait for the new mosaic  here is an oldie-but-goodie natural color view of Saturn's dazzling ring system (Feb. 11  2005). This mosaic of six images covers a distance of approximately 62 000 kilometers along the ring plane. That's about 38 525 miles -- almost five times Earth's diameter!

Now that I'm done sending the 323 images for the Saturn mosaic back home  on Friday  July 26  I'll be focusing on Titan and its lakes. Monitoring the Titan lakes is important for tracking if and how they evolve over time and whether they change with the seasons. Are they evaporating and getting smaller  or staying the same  or getting larger?  Good questions. Stay tuned.  http://go.nasa.gov/132kB9x,HER,photo

CASSINI WEEKLY IMAGE: Two Moons Passing in the Night   Mimas and Pandora are drastically different. Although they are both moons of Saturn  Pandora's small size means that it lacks sufficient gravity to pull itself into a round shape like its larger sibling  Mimas. Researchers believe that the elongated shape of Pandora may hold clues to how it and other moons near the rings formed. More at . . . http://go.nasa.gov/11a4DZR,HER,photo

This simulated image of Saturn's rings was created from Cassini's first radio occultation observations of the rings  which began on May 3  2005. The image was constructed from the measured optical depth profiles of the Cassini Division and ring A. It depicts the observed structure at about 10 kilometers (6 miles) in resolution.   Color is used to represent information about ring particle sizes based on the measured effects of the three radio signals. Shades of red indicate regions where there is a lack of particles less than 5 centimeters (about 2 inches) in diameter. Green and blue shades indicate regions where there are particles of sizes smaller than 5 centimeters (2 inches) and 1 centimeter (less than one third of an inch)  respectively.  It depicts the observed structure at about 10 kilometers (6 miles) in resolution.  More at: http://go.nasa.gov/1081WaP,HER,photo

As it swooped past the south pole of Saturn's moon Enceladus on July 14  2005  Cassini acquired high resolution views of this puzzling ice world. From afar  Enceladus exhibits a bizarre mixture of softened craters and complex  fractured terrains.

This colourful scene taken with a fish-eye (fulldome) lens shows the beauty of the Chilean night sky in crisp ultra high definition from Paranal  home to the Very Large Telescope array (VLT). The Milky Way shines brightly above the platform where each of the four 8.2m Unit Telescopes (UTs) can be seen close-up.  The VLTI building can be seen also to the right  which is where the light from each of the individual telescopes is combined  allowing astronomers to see details up to 25 times finer than with the individual telescopes.

ESO Flashback: The GOODS-South field. Feel free to share!  This composite image of the GOODS-South field — the result of an extremely deep survey using two of the four giant 8.2-metre telescopes composing ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT) and a unique custom-built filter — shows some of the faintest galaxies ever seen. It also allows astronomers to determine that 90% of galaxies whose light took 10 billion years to reach us have gone undiscovered.

The colourful sky of the Chilean Atacama Desert at night.  In the background  the quiet beauty of the Atacama sky is enhanced by a orange/yellow aurora-like shimmer  called airglow  which is caused by light-emitting chemical reactions in the atmosphere. Normally  those emissions are not so strong  but the night this image was taken they were unusually bright  producing this special picture.  #ESOultraHD Credit: ESO Astronomy / Babak Tafreshi  ESO Photo Ambassador,HER,photo

The planetary nebula NGC 6781 lies a few thousand light-years away towards the constellation of Aquila (the Eagle) and is approximately two light-years across. Within NGC 6781  shells of gas blown off from the faint  but very hot  central star’s surface expand out into space. These shells shine under the harsh ultraviolet radiation from the progenitor star in intricate and beautiful patterns. The central star will steadily cool down and darken  eventually disappearing from view into cosmic oblivion.

Now You See It  Now You Don't  Now You Do Again  In the early morning hours  the arrival of the winter solstice was marked by a total lunar eclipse lasting three hours  28 minutes. Photographer Sean Smith recorded how it looked over NASA's Langley Research Center.  The last time a total lunar eclipse and the winter solstice coincided and was seen over this part of Virginia  the area was still being settled  nearby Jamestown was recovering from the starving time and the first buildings of Williamsburg were under construction.  It was Dec. 21  1638  The next time a similar occurrance can be seen over North America will be Dec. 21  2094.  A total lunar eclipse occurs when Earth aligns directly between the sun and moon  blocking the suns rays and casting a shadow over the moon. As it moves deeper into the Earth's shadow  the full moon changes color  from gray to orange or deep red. In this case  the moon was in complete shadow for 72 minutes.,HER,photo

The Perseids are Back! Wish upon a star... dozens of times a night! Heading out to cottage country or camping? Be sure to look for the Perseids  one of the most impressive annual meteor showers! Each year  from late July to mid-August  hundreds of meteors rain down on our skies as the Earth passes through the tail of Comet Swift-Tuttle. An increasing number of shooting stars should be visible every night  until the light show culminates August 12-13. During the peak  typically in the darkest hours after midnight  up to 50 to 80 meteors per hour can streak across the sky.  Here are a few tips for meteor hunting: •If possible  head away from city lights  which make it hard to see fainter meteors. To increase your chances of seeing shooting stars  set out in search of dark skies in the countryside.  • Dress warmly. Even though the Perseids occur in the summertime  it is still a good idea to bring warm (even winter) clothes. August nights can be very chilly. • Sit back and relax on a reclining chair or lie down on a blanket. Not only is it much more comfortable to observe the stars lying down  but you'll also see more that way. • Pack a thermos of hot chocolate or coffee—it will come in handy if you start to drift off or get a little chilly!  • If you need to use a flashlight  place a red filter over the bulb (a red balloon will do in a bind). White light is very blinding and may affect your night vision. • Be patient. It might take a while before you see your first shooting star. Don't be quick to give up... It's worth the wait!  And don't forget to make a wish! Photo: Perseids below! Astronaut Ron Garan snapped this shot of a Perseid meteor (the white streak) below the International Space Station (ISS) on August 13  2011.

Postcards from a Comet Steep cliffs  boulders  plains and rocky terrain. These features could be from many places on Earth  but you are actually looking at the surface of a comet. The image was taken from the European Space Agency’s Rosetta spacecraft  which successfully entered into orbit around Comet 67P early this morning after a 10-year trek across the solar system into deep space (more than five times Earth’s distance from the Sun). The spacecraft will continue its cosmic dance around the comet  beaming back imagery and data to find out what the comet is made of. Rosetta will also scout out a landing area and  in November  will lower a probe called Philae down onto the comet’s surface.

Today  the CSA hosted students from the International Space University’s Space Sciences Department to execute an analogue rover mission. On Monday  the students were introduced to planetary science and in-situ resource utilization  and developed a science exploration plan for the mission. They had to decide which instruments to configure on the rover  the route to take  science targets  contingencies and all other aspects of the mission.  The premise of the exercise was that a crew travelling to Mars (the students) had to control a rover on Mars to determine the best landing site for their capsule with the help of a ground team (the instructors who were in a separate room). Communications delays added to the challenge. The objective was to provide an opportunity for ISU students to participate in the definition  planning  and execution of a realistic robotic planetary exploration mission.  This activity was proposed and organized by Neptec  a Canadian space company  and Planetary Scientists Melissa Battler and Mary Kerrigan of Western University’s Centre for Planetary Science and Exploration with the support of the CSA. CSA astronaut David Saint-Jacques was also on hand both days to coach the students and support the instructors.,HER,photo

University students from across Canada – and from Bologna  Italy – spent the last three days at CSA's David Florida Laboratory to take part in the final phase of the Canadian Satellite Design Challenge (CSDC) – the launch environmental testing of the their “cubesat” satellites.  The satellites were submitted to vibration testing  which simulates the vibration experienced during launch. Afterwards  each team then has to perform a functional test of their satellite  to demonstrate that it survived the testing in full working order.  In this second offering of the CSDC  teams from five universities – Victoria  Manitoba  Waterloo  Concordia  and a combined team from the École Polytechnique de Montréal and the University of Bologna – tested their completed cubesat satellites.   The CSDC is a Canada-wide competition for university students to design and build a small operational research satellite. The ultimate goal of this competition is to launch the winning "cubesats" into orbit in order to conduct science research.   The CSDC objectives are to enhance space-related knowledge and capacity at Canadian universities; increase academia-industry co-operation in space-related research and development  and expose participants to the management processes of a large engineering project. The winning team will be announced tonight. Good luck!  Written with content by Geocentrix.ca.,HER,photo

How do we drive Dextre and fly Canadarm2?  Justin Cuplinkas asked us for details on how Canadarm2 and Dextre are operated. Here's the answer from Ed Birchnall  flight controller at the CSA and part of the team that trains flight controllers and astronauts in robotics:   Canadarm2 and Dextre were designed to be operated the same way and there are several different options available. There are two joysticks (or hand-controllers as we call them) at the robotics workstation on the International Space Station. If an astronaut were to fly one of the arms in what we call manual mode  they would use both hand controllers to drive the Canadarm2. The translational hand controller can move the tip (or another point we decide on) up  down  left  right  in and out. The rotational hand-controller can make the robotic arm rotate in pitch  yaw and roll. This is how the astronauts drive Canadarm2 to capture a visiting vehicle like the SpaceX Dragon that is docked right now  or to move an astronaut around on the end of Candarm2 during a spacewalk.  The hand-controllers can also be used to drive the arm one joint at a time or to swing the "elbow" of the arm. Imagine holding on to a door knob and without moving your hand  rotating your elbow.   We can also drive the arms without hand controllers  which is the way it is controlled by the ground at Johnson Space Center and here at the CSA by the mission control team.  We call these "automatic sequences."  We can pick a set of coordinates around the space station where we want the tip of the arm to be and tell it to go there. We can also tell all seven joints which position to go to and they will all drive at the same time to get to their final positions at the same time.  This is our most common way of operating which allows us to do some of the really complex motions of Candarm2 and Dextre.    The same hand-controllers can be used to operate both Canadarm2 and Dextre but they can only drive one arm at a time. Today  the hand...,HER,photo

Today on the International Space Station  Dextre became the first space robot to repair its own system when he removed a faulty camera located on Canadarm2's elbow and relocated it to the mobile base (together  Dextre  Canadarm2 and the mobile base form the Mobile Servicing System  Canada's robotic contribution to the space station).  It took two tries to remove the camera from its mounting on Canadarm2  likely because cold metal tends to be a bit sticky. But Dextre got it out on the third try with a bit of jiggling...and some elbow grease!  The first of two cameras that Dextre will replace in the coming days  this camera produced hazy images--like looking through a foggy window. While it may not be clear enough to help guide Canadarm2's movements  it will be sufficient for providing images from its new location on the mobile base. At the end of the day  Canadarm2 moved Dextre into a park position for the next operations on Tuesday  when Dextre will retrieve a second camera from the Japanese module’s airlock—the first time this has ever been attempted--and place it on the empty slot on Canadarm2's elbow.

Did you find the answer to the question in our previous post? No? Well this "rod" is actually one of eight 1-meter long superbolts that secured the folded Canadarm2 in its launch cradle (the Spacelab Pallet  seen in the photo). CSA astronaut Chris Hadfield and NASA's Scott Parazynski removed the eight bolts before unfolding the arm and installing it on the space station in April 2001. One of these bolts is now on display at our headquarters.    The same pallet was used in 2008 to launch Canada's robotic handyman Dextre.,HER,photo

NASA Astronauts Steve Swanson and Rick Mastracchio (wearing the suit with the red stripes) successfully completed a 1.5 hour spacewalk to replace a failed back up computer (MDM) this morning. The MDM is one of two computers that provide telemetry and command for various external systems  including the Mobile Transporter that carries Dextre and Canadarm2.   CSA Astronaut Jeremy Hansen did a great job as Ground IV  guiding the spacewalkers through procedures from NASA's Mission Control Center in Houston  Texas. It was the first time that a Canadian played this important role from the ground. Jeremy can be seen top left on the second picture.  An all-Canadian robotics team (ROBO) was also on console at CSA to configure Dextre's cameras to watch part of the spacewalk.   The spacewalk went quickly and smoothly and Swanson was even able to perform a get-ahead task by cutting a dangling lanyard that prevented Dextre from finishing a demo task last June. This 179th spacewalk in support of the assembly and maintenance of the ISS was Mastracchio's 9th spacewalk and Swanson's 5th.

A Canadian First! CSA Astronaut Jeremy Hansen will have a front row seat during next week’s contingency spacewalk to replace a failed backup computer on the International Space Station (ISS). Sitting by the Capcom at NASA’s Mission Control Center  he will be acting as Ground IV  or Intravehicular crewmember  supporting NASA’s Rick Mastracchio and Steve Swanson and helping them with procedures during the spacewalk.   While Marc Garneau  Julie Payette and Chris Hadfield have acted as IV in the past from inside the ISS  it will be the first time a Canadian astronaut is trusted with the role of “spacewalk choreographer” from the ground.  The 2 5-hour spacewalk is set for Wednesday  April 23  unless SpaceX scrubs its launch attempt today  in which case the excursion will move up earlier to Easter Sunday  April 20. In preparation for the spacewalk  Jeremy took part in countless team meetings this week to plan  develop procedures and anticipate everything that could go wrong. In this picture from April 16  he uses a spacesuit simulator to practice emergencies.  Read more about the spacewalk: http://ow.ly/vUEGO,HER,photo

Welding in space?  David (@Ri_kiri) sent us the following question via the CSA's Twitter account (@csa_asc):  "Is welding possible in space? I'm assuming it would be too great a safety risk to do outside of robotics." Here's the answer from Marie-Josée Potvin  CSA engineer in structural dynamics: "We can't weld the way we do on Earth because the heat doesn't dissipate the same way  since there is no air to cool down a surface. In other situations  if a hot surface is exposed to deep space  it would lose its heat much faster than on Earth.  However  welding can happen in other fashions.  When two pieces made of the same material are in contact in a vacuum (such as in space)  the atoms will migrate and the two pieces of material will actually stick together. Some theories predict that that lunar dust submitted to microwaves could melt and become solid. Other methods of welding using a narrow heat distribution  such as with a laser  might also be possible.",HER,status

Today is #WorldCancerDay.  Space is a hazardous environment to live and work in  especially when it comes to radiation. Originating from violent storms on the Sun and galactic cosmic rays  this natural radiation can pose a serious health risk for astronauts on long-duration space missions like those on the International Space Station where radiation levels are hundreds of times higher than the levels on Earth.  The CSA's support of radiation research will not only lead to major advancements for future human exploration of space  but also in our knowledge of the health risks of radiation  such as cancer  neurological damage and degenerative tissue disease.

MEDIA: Statement by the President of the Canadian Space Agency on the 15th Anniversary of the International Space Station "Fifteen years ago today  Canada became one of the five partners in the most complex scientific and technological endeavours ever undertaken—the International Space Station. The launch of the first element of the space station—a Russian module appropriately named "Zarya " or "dawn"— on November 20  1998 marked the beginning of a new international collaboration that demonstrates daily how countries can work together to achieve peaceful objectives.  The cutting-edge science conducted aboard this unique orbiting science lab touches a variety of fields of research vital to life on Earth: ageing  cardiology  neurology  materials science  and learning the effects of radiation on the human body.  Canadian ingenuity literally built the space station with Canadarm2. Our talented engineers developed cutting-edge technology critical to the station's daily operations. Today  Dextre  the station's resident robotic "handyman" conducts routine maintenance jobs that frees up crew time for science. Canadian astronauts have travelled to  worked on and commanded the orbiting laboratory in eight separate missions. And countless future Canadian space scientists and engineers—and the next-generation of Canadian astronauts—have been inspired by seeing our country's achievements.  On behalf of the Canadian Space Agency  I congratulate all the women and men around the globe that are part of this monumental accomplishment for our collective future."  http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/media/news_releases/2013/1120.asp,HER,photo
The International Space Station Turns 15 today! Celebrate with us! Russia’s Zarya  the first module of the International Space Station  was launched on this day in 1998. Appropriately named "Dawn " Zarya marked the daybreak of one of the most complex scientific and technological endeavours ever undertaken.

On this day in 1995  CSA Astronaut Col. Chris Hadfield launched aboard Shuttle Atlantis on his first of three spaceflights. During Mission STS-74  he used the Shuttle's Canadarm to install a docking module to the Russian space station Mir. The Canadian-built Advanced Space Vision System was also used to perform this assembly task. http://ow.ly/qKK5z,HER,photo
Chris Hadfield  retired Canadian astronaut and former Commander of the International Space Station  presents the Bank of Canada's Governor  Stephen S. Poloz  with the $5 note that he flew to the space station earlier this year.  The Bank of Canada also launched a $10 note at an event held simultaneously at Vancouver’s train station. As those of us at the CSA watched the event linking the symbols of Canada's past and current ingenuity  we were reminded of this prophetic quote from John H. Chapman  father of the Canadian Space Program: "In the second century of Confederation  the fabric of Canadian society will be held together by strands in space just as strongly as railway and telegraphy held together the scattered provinces in the last century." We  in the space program  are humbled and honoured  and so very  very proud. And we hope Canadians are  too.  http://ow.ly/i/3EKvh,HER,link

The Perseids are Back! Wish upon a star…dozens of times a night! Heading out to cottage country or camping?  Be sure to look for the Perseids  one of the most impressive annual meteor showers! Each year  from late July to mid-August  hundreds of meteors rain down on our skies as the Earth passes through the tail of Comet Swift-Tuttle. An increasing number of shooting stars should be visible every night  until the light show culminates on the nights of August 11-13. During the peak  typically in the darkest hours after midnight  up to 50 to 80 meteors per hour can streak across the sky.  Here are a few tips for meteor hunting: - If possible  head away from city lights  which make it hard to see fainter meteors. To increase your chances of seeing shooting stars  set out in search of dark skies in the countryside.  - Dress warmly. Even though the Perseids occur in the summertime  it is still a good idea to bring warm (even winter) clothes. August nights can be very chilly. - Sit back and relax on a reclining chair or lie down on a blanket. Not only is it much more comfortable to observe the stars lying down  but you’ll also see more that way. - Pack a thermos of hot chocolate or coffee—it will come in handy if you start to drift off or get a little chilly!  - If you need to use a flashlight  place a red filter over the bulb (a red balloon will do in a bind). White light is very blinding and may affect your night vision. - Be patient. It might take a while before you see your first shooting star. Don’t be quick to give up... It’s worth the wait.  And don’t forget to make a wish! Photo: Perseids below! Astronaut Ron Garan snapped this shot of a Perseid meteor (the white streak) below the International Space Station on August 13  2011.

Space in a Suitcase: Astronaut Jeremy Hansen’s Roving Mission! Today  Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen will remotely pilot a prototype of a lunar rover at the Canadian Space Agency’s analogue terrain to kick off the “Space in a Suitcase” technology demonstration. The goal of the project is to determine the best  most intuitive ways for an astronaut to command a helper rover from a base on the surface of the Moon. As its name hints  Space in a Suitcase is a portable rover command kit that will enable Jeremy to operate any of the CSA’s rovers from anywhere in the world. Using on-board cameras and data  he’ll guide the rover through a series of obstacles with a slight communications delay (varying between 1-3 seconds) and very limited bandwidth (try 100 kbps!) to simulate the real-time communications challenges between the Earth and the Moon.  And  to make the simulation even more realistic  we won’t even let him peek at the terrain until his mission is complete! Stay tuned this week for updates and photos of Jeremy’s newest mission!

How Chris Hadfield Exercises Back to Health by Natalie Hirsch  Canadian Space Agency Exercise Specialist  Most of the muscles that control posture on earth go on vacation for the duration of a space mission  except during 2 hours of in-flight exercise per day  and upon return to earth need to work every waking minute to support the body.  These conditions leave astronauts feeling fatigued  stiff  sore and unstable upon return to earth. (Consider that astronauts do not sit down while in space so even their tailbones hurt while they get used to sitting again on Earth.)   Fortunately  our bodies are amazing machines that continually adapt to our surroundings and the discomfort experienced upon return to earth is temporary and part of the normal response of a healthy human body getting used to a significantly different environment.  The time to adapt to a new environment varies between astronauts: genetics  fitness  age  duration in space  exercise in space and upon return to earth can all play a role in how long it takes to return to being a healthy & fit earthling.  The overall goal of the post-flight reconditioning program is to assist an astronaut in returning to his pre-flight physical fitness - ensuring that he (or she) is just as sprightly after a stint in microgravity as he was before launch. This includes making sure his balance  agility  muscular endurance  strength and power  flexibility  cardiovascular fitness and bone density are similar to when he left earth.  Reconditioning:  Week 1 The first week of reconditioning included a movement assessment to identify how the returning astronaut performs basic movements (balancing  stepping  squatting  and lunging) and exercises to practice these movements.   The focus of the first few days of reconditioning was on balance  coordination and locomotion - getting used to controlling body in gravity - and cardiovascular fitness.    More on why and how astronauts exercise in space: http://ow.ly/lbB2r,HER,photo
Fourth update on Chris Hadfield’s condition   by Raffi Kuyumjian  CSA’s Chief Medical Officer and Hadfield’s Flight Surgeon  The weekend schedule will allow Chris some "active rest". His walk continues to improve despite some lingering dizziness and soreness in his back muscles  which are slowly getting used to working again in keeping the back straight and upright against gravity after 5 months of complete rest... Somewhat similar to having spent 24/7 in bed without moving for 5 months and then suddenly having to get up and walk!  Today a session of science data collection on Manual Control testing for coordination and reaction times using a motion flight simulator and car simulator amongst others: showing clear signs of improvement compared to 3 days ago when he completed the same tests! After the usual 2-hour daily reconditioning session  a few interview sessions will complete the day for Chris.    Photo: Manual Control testing using a Motion Flight Simulator. May 18  2013.

Choice quotes from Col. Chris Hadfield during his news conference (paraphrased):  "On the ISS  when you have 30 seconds free  you go do something else!"  "It's a whole new normal  my body was perfectly happy living in space... My body is catching up with the change."  "We're learning about the fundamental nature of matter because the ISS exists."  "People followed me because there is poetry and purpose in what is happening on the ISS."  "I'm not a person who looks back and wishes that my past was my present."  "In the gym yesterday  it felt like someone was squeezing me down into the floor  felt like it was so unfair!"  "Zero gravity is like a superpower!"  "We are working hard to make the most out of the taxpayer's dollar and make the ISS a fabric of the lives of Canadians."   "I don't have a callouses on the bottom of my feet yet  I'm walking around like an infant."  "CSA's Microflow tested to show how space tech can help remote communities with things like blood testing."  "We're also inspiring our youth to do something that barely seems possible."  On his landing: "We could smell spring  the charred spacecraft  growing grass wafting through the open door."  "In 2001  ISS was barely functional  only 1 lab  it was just getting going. The reason we put Canadarm2 on was to build ISS."  "The number of people following is a measure of the number of people who shared the experience."  "My advice: turn yourself into what you want to become step by step as a demonstration of personal will."  On his favourite photo he took in space: "Most proud of the pic of the Sun over Indian ocean  noctilucent clouds  revealing how our upper atmosphere works.",HER,status

Robotic Refueling Mission: Day 2  Dextre worked throughout the night on the Robotics Refueling Mission (RRM)  removing two small caps on the NASA-provided module. The second task of the night  unfastening tiny screws  proceeded slowly but successfully. It took several tries for Dextre to use the safety cap tool to pick up the torque set adapter (i.e. a space screwdriver!)  but the sixth time was a charm! Dextre then used the adapter to remove two screws  the first of which was a test screw enclosed inside a special cage to ensure it could not be dropped. Dextre manipulated both the caged and uncaged screws correctly.  While robots are able to work tirelessly  the human ground control crews will take a break over the weekend! RRM operations will resume on Monday. Stay tuned as Dextre checks off more unprecedented tasks on his job list  including the first time a space robot will manipulate thermal blankets.

The Robotic Refueling Mission (RRM): Day 1  Last night  Dextre was on duty doing precision work for RRM  successfully replacing a safety cap in its receptacle—a typical task that a robot would do if dispatched to repair a failing satellite in space.   On Day 2  operations will continue this afternoon and into the night as Dextre uses his delicate sense of touch to remove tiny screws on the RRM module using custom-built power tools provided by NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. Ever dropped a screw while removing it? Then imagine Dextre  a 3.7-metre tall robot  balancing on the end of Canadarm2 (which is as long as a bus)  unfastening teensy screws that simply must not be dropped. Ground control teams at NASA’s Johnson Space Center  Goddard and the CSA will be working closely together to ensure that operations proceed smoothly in this challenging test for the space station’s resident handyman.

Canadian astronomers reveal surprising new portrait of the Early Universe  Planck space mission sheds light on the Universe's age  evolution and composition Longueuil  Quebec  March 21  2013 – The Planck Space Telescope has produced by far the best map ever made of the most ancient light in the Universe  showing that it is slightly older than previously thought  expanding more slowly and that there is more matter than known before.  Planck includes contributions from the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The CSA funds two Canadian research teams that are part of the Planck science collaboration  and who helped develop both of Planck's complementary science instruments  the High Frequency Instrument (HFI) and the Low Frequency Instrument (LFI). Professors J. Richard Bond of the University of Toronto (Director of Cosmology and Gravity at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research) and Douglas Scott of the University of British Columbia lead the Canadian Planck team  which includes members from the University of Alberta  Université Laval and McGill University.   Canadian astronomers are members of the international team unveiling Planck's results in Paris today. Led by the European Space Agency  the Planck Space Telescope has been surveying the sky since launched in 2009. The telescope's incredible accuracy allows it to pinpoint faint  minute patterns—differences in light and temperature that correspond to slightly different densities in the matter left over from the Big Bang. The data being released today are from the first 15 months of the mission  and show a map of the Universe when it was just 380 000 years old.   Planck's data confirm and refine previous models of how astronomers believe the Universe originated and evolved  but with intriguing new details. The Planck team has calculated that the Universe is 13.82 billion years old—100 million years older than earlier estimates. Planck has revealed that the Universe is expanding significantly slower than the...,HER,photo

Happy 5th Birthday  Dextre! Dextre  the Canadian-built robotic handyman on board the International Space Station  was launched on board the Space Shuttle Endeavour on March 11  2008. Since then  Dextre has given a helping hand (two  to be precise!) to the crew by taking care of a variety of routine maintenance jobs outside the station. Dextre has moved cargo transport containers  replaced failed electrical parts  unpacked visiting spacecraft and became the first robot ever to refuel a mock satellite in space.

Secrets of the Starry Summer Night - What to see this August   • The Perseid Meteor Showers: Each year  the Earth passes through the tail of Comet Swift-Tuttle  causing shooting stars as tiny particles streak through Earth’s atmosphere. This year  the peak is expected on the night of August 12  with dozens of meteors expected each hour. Look to the northeast after midnight  and keep your list of wishes on hand.  • The International Space Station: The second brightest object in the night sky after the full Moon  the Station can be seen with the naked eye. It looks much like an aircraft  minus the blinking lights. To see the Station  visit http://heavens-above.com and enter the name of your hometown. When you see the Station glide by overhead  think of the Canada wordmark waving proudly on Canadarm2 and Dextre  the Canadian Space Agency robots hard at work on board. Canadian astronaut Col. Chris Hadfield will join them when he blasts off to the Station in December 2012 for a six-month mission that will make him the first Canadian Commander of the orbiting science lab.  • The Northern Lights: The aurora borealis are frequent in Canada’s North  but they can also be seen in southern parts of the country during periods of intense solar activity.

RRM: Dextre’s Duty Log for Day 3  Dextre capped off three days of success for the Robotic Refueling Mission (RRM) on June 21  2012. Using the Multifunction Tool built by NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center  Dextre used an adapter to perform a series of intricate ops beneath the RRM ambient cap  including using a plunger inside the tool to simulate breaking the seal on a fuel tank—an essential step in refueling a real satellite (the fuel tank on most satellites is sealed up prior to launch  since they are usually not designed to be repaired). One of the goals of RRM is to demonstrate how robots could perform the tasks necessary for refueling and servicing a satellite in space.   After completing work on the plug and ambient cap  Dextre then picked up another adapter for the Multifunction Tool (similar to a multi-bit screwdriver—Dextre switched adapters throughout the three days much like a handyman changes the tips for a screwdriver). Dextre succeeded in fitting the adapter on a tertiary cap on the RRM module  a task which required minute precision  and which is even difficult for human hands. Afterwards  Dextre stowed the multifunction tool and its adapter in the RRM tool bay and conducted some tests on a nozzle tool that will be used during the next phase of RRM  when Dextre will simulate refueling the RRM mock satellite.

Where in the Universe is this?   It’s time once again for the Where In The Universe Challenge. Hard to believe we’ve done thirty of these already  and our readers are getting really good at this. The goal of the WITU challenge is to test your skills and visual knowledge of our universe. Guess where this image is from  and give yourself extra points if you can guess which spacecraft is responsible for the image. Mull over the image  make your guess and post a comment if you’re brave enough. Check back tomorrow at this same post to find the answer and see how you did. Good luck!  Ready for the answer?  Again  nice job everyone! Yes  this is the surface of Venus  taken by the Venera 9 lander before it quickly succumbed to the heat and pressure of the planet. From June to October 1975  the Russian space probe Venera 9 became the first craft to orbit  land on  and photograph Venus. Venera 9 consisted of two main parts that separated in orbit  an orbiter and a lander. The 5 070-pound (2 300-kilogram) orbiter relayed communication and photographed the planet in ultraviolet light. The lander entered the Venusian atmosphere using a series of parachutes and employed a special panoramic photometer to produce 180-degree panoramic photos of the surface of the planet.  Great job  everyone! Come back again for next week’s WITU Challenge.,LER,photo

Make a Deal for Land on the Moon  Whether its asteroid prospecting  mining interests  or space tourism  a lot of industries are taking aim at space exploration.

Here’s another “Where In The Universe” challenge  and in keeping with the Mission:Impossible theme from the previous post  your mission  should you choose to accept  is to identify where in the universe this image was taken. Give yourself extra points if you can name the spacecraft responsible for the image. Does everyone have their watches synchronized and secret decoder image detectors ready? It’s fairly certain this website will not self destruct in five seconds  so take your time looking at the image.  This is an image of a dune field on Mars in Wirtz Crater  and yes  the white material is actually frost on the dunes. It was taken by the HiRISE Camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. I came across this image while searching for more evidence of frost on Mars  other than what the Phoenix and Viking Landers had imaged. Just to make sure I wasn’t seeing things  I checked in with Nathan Bridges from JPL and the HiRISE Team about this image. He explains  “The white material is frost  composed of water and/or carbon dioxide. When this image was taken  it was winter in this part of Mars and it gets cold enough for water to condense out of the atmosphere and even for the atmosphere itself to freeze (the atmosphere is made of CO2) The color is approximately what you would see on Mars  but is enhanced to bring out detail.”  This image was taken on January 7  2007 at about 3:50 in the afternoon  Mars local time  as HiRISE was 254 km (158.7 miles) above Mars’ surface. Wirtz Crater is located at -48 degrees latitude and 334.6 degrees longitude east.  For more information about this image  or to get higher resolution versions of the entire image swath  check out HiRISE’s website.  Congrats to Bruce Thompson - you got it right in one!,LER,photo

On this day:  23 September 1846  Neptune was first observed by Berlin Observatory astronomer Johann Gottfried Galle (DE)  very near to the locations independently predicted by astronomers John Couch Adams (UK) and Urbain Joseph Le Verrier (FR).   Adams and Le Verrier had made their calculations based on the positions of Jupiter  Saturn and Uranus. An international dispute arose between the English and French (though not  apparently between Adams and Le Verrier personally) over priority and the right to name the new planet; they are now jointly credited with Neptune's discovery.   Subsequent observations have shown that the orbits calculated by Adams and Le Verrier diverge from Neptune's actual orbit fairly quickly. Had the search for the planet taken place a few years earlier or later it would not have been found anywhere near the predicted location (Image:NASA/JPL),HER,photo
Discovered this day in 1789  this is Mimas  a moon of Saturn  imaged by the international Cassini mission on 13 February 2010  from a distance of 70 000 km from Mimas.
