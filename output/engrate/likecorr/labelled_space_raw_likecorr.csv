Dear Lance   When I was a kid  you could take apart most things in the house with a screwdriver.  Inside  you’d see gears and pulleys and motors and occasionally a circuit board.  Back then  it was easy to take things apart.  But it was much harder to put things back together again.  Which meant that practically every home had a bin of discarded mechanical parts that you could play with --- and possibly invent something new.  Today  not so much.  But since you’ve already attempted to make an electric generator  clearly your basement is well-supplied.   Labs are fun places  but of course  they can also be dangerous -- especially if you’re exploring unfamiliar objects and ideas.  When you run out of supplies in your basement  this catalog: www.scientificsonline.com  and this one: www.hand2mind.com  and this one: www.fatbraintoys.com are loaded with sciencey stuff to play with  long into adulthood.  And anytime things get too dangerous  or if you just want to take a break from inventing stuff  yes  there’s always 13 episodes of Cosmos to watch.  In the meantime  here’s a short list of things the world needs invented.  Maybe you can get started on them right away:  a real hoverboard; a refrigerator door that dispenses soft ice cream instead of ice & water; warp drives; and of course...politicians who know science.  As always  keep looking up. -Neil deGrasse Tyson  New York City  P.S. My mother tells me that when I was born she almost named me “Lance”.,HER,photo
Dear Facebook Universe   In case you didn't know  the actual Sun (as a Jack-o-Lantern) wishes everyone on Earth a Happy Halloween. (via @NASASunEarth)  -NDTyson,HER,photo
Dear Facebook Universe   At the request of the White House  I offer reflections on the attached image of our home  released today  July 20  2015  forty-six years to the day after the first bootprints were left on the Moon.  =========  Earth. Not mounted on a stand  with color-coded state and national boundaries  as schoolroom globes are prone to display. Instead  we see our world as only a cosmic perspective can provide: Blue Oceans -- Dry Land -- White Clouds -- Polar Ice. A Sun-lit planet  teeming with life  framed in darkness.  In 1972  when NASA’s Apollo 17 astronauts first captured an entire hemisphere of our planet  we were treated to such a view. The Blue Marble  it was called. The Space Program’s unprecedented images of Earth compelled us all to think deeply about our dependence on nature and the fate of our civilization.  Of course  at the time  we had other distractions. Between 1968 and 1972  the United States would experience some of its most turbulent years in memory  simultaneously enduring a hot war in Southeast Asia  a Cold War with the Soviet Union  the Civil Rights Movement  campus unrest  and assassinations. Yet that’s precisely when we voyaged to the Moon  paused  looked back  and discovered Earth for the first time.  The year 1970 would celebrate the first Earth Day. In that same year  the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) were formed with strong bipartisan support. In 1972  the pesticide DDT was banned and the Clean Water Act was passed. And one year later  the Endangered Species Act would be enacted  the catalytic converter would be introduced  and unleaded automotive emission standards would be set. A stunning admission that we’re all in this together  with a common future on a shared planet.  Regrettably  we still live in a turbulent world. But we now have at our disposal  not simply a photograph of our home to reflect upon  but continual data of our rotating planet  captured 13 times per day  by the robotic Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR)  a specially designed space camera & telescope  launched and positioned a million miles from Earth.  We will now be able to measure and track Sun-induced space weather as well as global climactic trends in ozone levels  aerosols  vegetation  volcanic ash  and Earth reflectivity  all in high resolution; just the kind of data our civilization needs to make informed cultural  political  and scientific decisions that affect our future.  Occasions such as this offer renewed confidence that we may ultimately become responsible shepherds of our own fate  and the fate of that fragile home we call Earth.

FYI:  Today  June 30  2015  was also Asteroid Day.  -NDTyson,HER,photo
Dear Facebook Universe   Today marks the 26th time a Leap Second will be added to the calendar.  In the second half of the 20th century  we started tracking time via atomic clocks  which happen to be more accurate and precise than the rotating Earth itself — our technology was better at keeping time than our planet was.  This crossover allowed us to notice that Earth’s rotation rate is  in fact  slowing down.  The primary culprit here is the Moon  whose tidal forces on Earth create friction between the sloshing oceans and our north-south coastlines.  In response  the Moon’s orbit is spiraling away from Earth at a rate of about 2-inches (4cm) per year.  Such is the layout of this cosmic ballet — choreographed by the forces of gravity.  Several other factors also influence Earth’s rotation  but can serve to either slow us down or speed us up. In all cases it involves the re-distribution of mass on Earth’s surface  changing our planets rotation properties.  These includes the freezing and melting of glaciers  mass migrations of animals  the buildup of new dams  and earthquakes.   Three ways to accommodate this fact: 1) Ignore it altogether.  2) Redefine the length of the Second  as necessary  to keep the total number of seconds the same  no matter the length of the day.  Or 3) intermittently add “leap” seconds to compensate.  If we did (1) then eventually  clock time will not make sense relative to what the Sun is doing.  If we did (2) then all the measurements that now depend on the precise definition of the second would be cast into flux.  So we choose option (3).  Beginning in 1972  on June 30 or December 31 (or both) we’ve added 25 leap seconds  as necessary.  Today is such a day.  Beginning in 1972  on June 30 or December 31 or both  we’ve added 25 leap seconds  as necessary.  Today is such a day.  Leap Seconds appear in the final minute of the last hour of today  Greenwich Time.  For the Eastern Time Zone (North America) this corresponds to 7:59 PM.  That minute will have 61 seconds in it.  Something I’ve celebrated each time with a very tiny bottle of champagne.  Whatever you do  don’t waste it.  As always  Keep looking up.  -Neil deGrasse Tyson  New York City  NOTE: June 30  2015. 5:30pm ET:  Added a paragraph (for completeness) and corrected the rate of Moon's recession  from 5 inches to 2 inches per year.,HER,status

I offer my thanks and appreciation to all who have helped make it a success. And I can say without hesitation that we've only just begun.  -NDTyson,HER,status
******GMO: follow-follow-up***** August 6th  2014  Interesting to see the range of reaction to my GMO remarks. One blog proclaimed "Tyson tells Liberals to Chill Out". When in fact I never mentioned anything about politics or political affiliations at all. Other blogs proclaimed that I supported GMOs  asking if I was paid by Monsanto. And in other places  the reaction could only be described as virulent.  I maintain the sense  thrust  and meaning of my comments.  In fact -- apart from my "chill out" quip in the video  which clearly deserved further explanation -- I didn't really vote one way or another on GMOs. You want to distinguish how genes are modified? Okay  then label everything  and create two subcategories of GMO. One that indicates laboratory and one that indicates agriculture. I said this explicitly in my Facebook post.  Furthermore  I never said GMOs were safer or more dangerous. I implied that if you think GMO-laboratory is **inherently** more dangerous to human life than GMO-agriculture you are simply wrong. They both can be bad for the environment. They both can be less healthy. They both can disrupt the local flora and fauna. But both methods wield an awesome power to improve food in every way that matters to humans: yields  appearance  vitamin content  sweetness  resistance to insects  resistance to weather extremes  and so forth.  As in all new foods  transgenic or otherwise  they should be tested for safety. [how many times do I need to say that?] And they should be tested for their effect on the environment. If the regulatory system is failing at this then it should be modified. And if the tests indicate a risk to the health of some humans and a benefit to others  then this should appear on the labeling. By the way  we already do this for peanuts  to protect people from peanut allergies. But there's no talk of banning them.  I note  of course  that we don't do this for wheat - a fully domesticated  genetically modified food. Yet many people suffer from wheat (gluten) allergies. Meanwhile foods that contain gluten display no explicit warnings at all. You just know that you're not supposed to buy and eat that baguette if you suffer from this condition.  Imagine if today  scientists showed you the Aurochs Wild Ox  and said -- "Give us time. In just a few years  we will genetically modify this wild animal  turning it into a different sub species whose sole purpose is to provide vast quantities of milk for humans to drink. They will produce 10x as much milk as did the original animal. But they will require vast grasslands to sustain. And some of you will get sick because you won't be able to digest the lactose. But no need to label this fact. People will just figure this out on their own. The rest of you will be fine. We'll call the result a Holstein Milk Cow."  What would anti GMO-laboratory people say this story? Would they embrace it or reject it? Of course  over the past 10 000 years  this is exactly what we've done to that Ox - or whatever is the agreed-upon origin of the domesticated Cow. Call it GMO-agriculture. If you reject GMOs you fundamentally reject it all.  Finally  I found it odd that people presumed I was taking sides. As an educator  my priority is to make sure people are informed -- accurately and honestly. For the purposes of general enlightenment  but especially before drawing policy or legislation that could affect us all.  I have nothing more to add. Or to subtract. On to other topics for me.  -Neil deGrasse Tyson,HER,status

Document of the Week  National Advisory Committee For Aeronautics (NACA) Resolution on the Subject of Space  Adopted January 16  1958.   Following the launch of first two Soviet Sputniks (in October and November 1957) the NACA created the Special Committee on Space Technology.  This committee was led by H. Guyford Stever  then associate dean of engineering at MIT.   The Special Committee's first written product was "A National Research Program for Space Technology " a staff study completed on January 14  1958.  The study characterized "the Soviet.....bid for world supremacy" as "a most serious challenge to the United States and the Western world " and called for "an energetic program for research and development for the conquest of space." The study also recommended that such a program follow "the pattern .... already developed by the NACA and the military services" and exemplified in the X-15 program  where "the scientific research [would] be the responsibility of a national civilian agency working in close cooperation with the applied research and development groups required for weapon-systems development by the military." This study was adopted by the NACA Executive Committee two days later  reappearing in a "Resolution on the Subject of Space Flight." The text of that resolution is shown in the 4 images below.

NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and the University of Alabama Huntsville (UAH) will host a symposium at the UAH campus in Huntsville  Alabama on March 16-17  2017  focusing upon the theme of NASA in the “Long” Civil Rights Movement. The symposium seeks to stimulate and bring together interdisciplinary scholarship addressing both the role and experience of NASA during this transformative period in American history. The sponsors welcome papers addressing the Civil Rights experience across NASA and that explore the experiences of African Americans  women  immigrants  and other politically/socially marginalized groups. The symposium also seeks papers examining NASA’s role in the modernization of the American South and the larger impact of the Cold War on the course of the Civil Rights Movement. The deadline for submitting a paper proposal is July 31  2016. Decisions about acceptance will be made by September 1  2016.

Document of the Week:  National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) Committee on Aerodynamics Meeting Minutes (excerpt)  Date: October 30  1947  Two weeks after Captain Charles Yeager had flown through Mach 1  breaking the “sound barrier”  the NACA committee responsible for high-speed flight research met. The NACA was interested in systematic research on high speed flight - not on setting arbitrary speed records. The Aerodynamics Committee was concerned that Army and Navy pilots on loan to the NACA for flight research programs might ignore the research program in the interest of setting new speed records. The Committee was concerned enough about this to send a message to the test pilots.,LER,photo
Space Shuttle Atlantis launched from Kennedy Space Center at 11:01 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time on August 2  1991. During this mission  the five-person STS-43 crew launched TDRS-5 (Tracking and Data Relay Satellite-5)  a communications satellite  into geosynchronous orbit. STS-43 lasted nearly nine days  during which the crew traveled 3.7 million miles.  Learn more about STS-43: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/archives/sts-43.html,HER,photo
On August 25  1989  (25 years ago today)  the Voyager 2 spacecraft had her final planetary encounter in our solar system.  Whizzing 4 950 kilometers (3 000 miles) over Neptune's north pole Voyager 2 became the first (and  so far  only) spacecraft to make a close fly by of this icy blue planet.  In fact  this pass was the closest that Voyager 2 had come to a planet since leaving the surface of the Earth on August 20  1977.    5 hours after the closest approach to Neptune  Voyager 2 passed 40 000 kilometers (25 000 miles) from Neptune's largest moon  Triton - returning spectacular imagery.  (see picture)  Voyager 2 also imaged the faint ring system around Neptune and a number of other smaller moons orbiting the big blue planet.,HER,photo
On September 17  1976  the first Space Shuttle Orbiter  which NASA had originally planed to name Space Shuttle Constitution  was rolled out of Rockwell's Air Force Plant 42  Site 1 in Palmdale  California. It was no coincidence; for on this date in 1787  the United States Constitution was signed  marking the beginning of our nation as we know it. In the US we celebrate this day as Constitution Day.  Another reason to choose the name Constitution for the first orbiter was to honor the USS Constitution - also known as "Old Ironsides."  Launched in 1797  Constitution was one of six original frigates authorized by the Naval Act of 1794. She is a wooden-hulled  three-masted heavy Navy frigate  and she is the oldest commissioned naval vessel afloat - currently home-based in Boston  MA.  However  fans of the popular TV show Star Trek thought the first shuttle should have a different name.  They started a write-in campaign urging the White House to name the first Shuttle Enterprise. President Gerald Ford eventually did so  honoring the fictional “Starship Enterprise.” Ironically  Enterprise was the only Shuttle not to have flown in space. As seen in this photo  the cast members of the original Star Trek series were on hand for the unveiling of the new Space Shuttle on this day in 1976.   After confirming the flight characteristics of the orbiter design in a series of Approach and Landing Tests and being used for a variety of other test and display purposes  Enterprise was turned over to the Smithsonian in 1985.  In 2012 Enterprise was transferred to the Intrepid Sea  Air and Space Museum  where she is now permanently displayed.

On September 23  1975  the final powered flight of the X-24B was piloted by NASA Research Pilot Bill Dana. The X-24B was an experimental research vehicle designed to test the possibilities of accurate  unpowered  re-entry vehicle landings. The X-24B represented the culmination of research done on a long line of wingless lifting bodies tested at NASA’s Flight Research Center (FRC) (now Armstrong Flight Research Center) between 1963 and 1975. The information gained from this research eventually led to the Space Shuttle’s design. The X-24B  as seen in the picture below  roughly resembles the Space Shuttle design with a flat underbelly and rounded top.   Top speed reached by the X-24B was 1 164 mph (Mach 1.75) by Air Force Major Mike Love on Oct. 25  1974. The highest altitude reached was 74 100 feet by NASA Research Pilot John Manke on May 22  1975. The X-24B was the final aircraft to fly in the lifting body research program.

On May 18  1969  Apollo 10 launched. This was the “dress rehearsal” for the first Moon landing later that year  designed to refine flight procedures for the actual landing. The crew completed almost all aspects of a lunar landing  even flying the lunar module (called Snoopy) nine miles from the Moon and transmitting the first live color TV pictures of its surface. Apollo 10 helped ensure the success of the legendary Apollo 11 flight in July of 1969.   Learn more about Apollo 10: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/missions/apollo10.html,HER,photo

ESA/Hubble Flashback: Hubble snaps images of a nebula within a cluster. Tag & share!  The unique planetary nebula NGC 2818 is nested inside the open star cluster NGC 2818A. Both the cluster and the nebula reside over 10 000 light-years away  in the southern constellation Pyxis (the Compass).  NGC 2818 is one of very few planetary nebulae in our galaxy located within an open cluster. Open clusters  in general  are loosely bound and they disperse over hundreds of millions of years. Stars that form planetary nebulae typically live for billions of years. Hence  it is rare that an open cluster survives long enough for one of its members to form a planetary nebula. This open cluster is particularly ancient  estimated to be nearly one billion years old.  Read more at: http://spacetelescope.org/images/ann0901a/  Credit:,HER,photo

ESA/Hubble Flashback: Hubble scores a perfect ten. Tag & share!  The NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope is back in business. Just a couple of days after the orbiting observatory was brought back online  Hubble aimed its prime working camera  the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2)  at a particularly intriguing target  a pair of gravitationally interacting galaxies called Arp 147.  The two galaxies happen to be oriented so that they appear to mark the number 10. The left-most galaxy  or the "one" in this image  is relatively undisturbed  apart from a smooth ring of starlight. It appears nearly edge-on to our line of sight. The right-most galaxy  the "zero" of the pair  exhibits a clumpy  blue ring of intense star formation.

Two bright regions (the 'eyes of the ghost')  named A1 (left) and A2 (right)  are very hot  glowing 'blobs' of hydrogen and oxygen. The bubble in A1 is produced by the hot  intense radiation and powerful stellar wind from a single massive star. A2 has a more complex appearance due to the presence of more dust  and it contains several hidden  massive stars. The massive stars in A1 and A2 must have formed within the last 10 000 years since their natal gas shrouds are not yet disrupted by the powerful radiation of the newly born stars.

ESA/Hubble Flashback: Hubble view of NGC 3314. Tag & share!   The NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope has produced an incredibly detailed image of a pair of overlapping galaxies called NGC 3314. While the two galaxies look as if they are in the midst of a collision  this is in fact a trick of perspective: the two are in chance alignment from our vantage point.

ESA/Hubble Flashback: The Hourglass Nebula. Tag & share!  This is an image of MyCn18  a young planetary nebula located about 8 000 light-years away  taken with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).  This Hubble image reveals the true shape of MyCn18 to be an hourglass with an intricate pattern of 'etchings' in its walls. This picture has been composed from three separate images taken in the light of ionized nitrogen (represented by red)  hydrogen (green)  and doubly-ionized oxygen (blue).  The results are of great interest because they shed new light on the poorly understood ejection of stellar matter which accompanies the slow death of Sun-like stars. In previous ground-based images  MyCn18 appears to be a pair of large outer rings with a smaller central one  but the fine details cannot be seen.

ESA/Hubble Flashback: Flocculent spiral NGC 2841. Tag & share!  Star formation is one of the most important processes in shaping the Universe; it plays a pivotal role in the evolution of galaxies and it is also in the earliest stages of star formation that planetary systems first appear.  Yet there is still much that astronomers don’t understand  such as how do the properties of stellar nurseries vary according to the composition and density of gas present  and what triggers star formation in the first place? The driving force behind star formation is particularly unclear for a type of galaxy called a flocculent spiral  such as NGC 2841 shown here  which features short spiral arms rather than prominent and well-defined galactic limbs.

ESA/Hubble Flashback: View of “Mystic Mountain”. Tag & share!  This craggy fantasy mountaintop enshrouded by wispy clouds looks like a bizarre landscape from Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings. The NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image  which is even more dramatic than fiction  captures the chaotic activity atop a pillar of gas and dust  three light-years tall  which is being eaten away by the brilliant light from nearby bright stars. The pillar is also being assaulted from within  as infant stars buried inside it fire off jets of gas that can be seen streaming from towering peaks.

ESA/Hubble Flashback: Pillars of Creation. Tag & share!  These columns that resemble stalagmites protruding from the floor of a cavern columns are in fact cool interstellar hydrogen gas and dust that act as incubators for new stars. Inside them and on their surface astronomers have found knots or globules of denser gas. These are called EGGs (acronym for "Evaporating Gaseous Globules"). Inside at least some of the EGGs stars being formed.  Undersea coral? Enchanted castles? Space serpents? These eerie  dark pillar-like structures are actually columns of cool interstellar hydrogen gas and dust that are also incubators for new stars. The pillars protrude from the interior wall of a dark molecular cloud like stalagmites from the floor of a cavern.

ESA/Hubble Flashback: Out of this whirl: The Whirlpool Galaxy (M51) and companion galaxy. Tag & share!  The graceful  winding arms of the majestic spiral galaxy M51 (NGC 5194) appear like a grand spiral staircase sweeping through space. They are actually long lanes of stars and gas laced with dust.  This sharpest-ever image  taken in January 2005 with the Advanced Camera for Surveys aboard the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope  illustrates a spiral galaxy's grand design  from its curving spiral arms  where young stars reside  to its yellowish central core  a home of older stars. The galaxy is nicknamed the Whirlpool because of its swirling structure.  Read more at: http://spacetelescope.org/images/heic0506a/  Credit:,HER,photo

The Crab is arguably the single most interesting object  as well as one of the most studied  in all of astronomy. The image is the largest image ever taken with Hubble's WFPC2 workhorse camera.  The Crab Nebula is one of the most intricately structured and highly dynamical objects ever observed. The new Hubble image of the Crab was assembled from 24 individual exposures taken with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope and is the highest resolution image of the entire Crab Nebula ever made.

ESA/Hubble Flashback: Young stars sculpt gas with powerful outflows. Tag & Share!  This Hubble Space Telescope view shows one of the most dynamic and intricately detailed star-forming regions in space  located 210 000 light-years away in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC)  a satellite galaxy of our Milky Way. At the centre of the region is a brilliant star cluster called NGC 346. A dramatic structure of arched  ragged filaments with a distinct ridge surrounds the cluster.  A torrent of radiation from the hot stars in the cluster NGC 346  at the centre of this Hubble image  eats into denser areas around it  creating a fantasy sculpture of dust and gas. The dark  intricately beaded edge of the ridge  seen in silhouette  is particularly dramatic. It contains several small dust globules that point back towards the central cluster  like windsocks caught in a gale.

The X-1A was flown six times by Bell Aircraft Company pilot Jean "Skip" Ziegler in 1953. Air Force test pilots Maj. Charles "Chuck" Yeager and Maj. Arthur "Kit" Murray made 18 flights between 21 November 1953 and 26 August 1954. The X-1A was then turned over to the NACA. Joe Walker piloted the first NACA flight on 20 July 1955. Walker attemped a second flight on 8 August 1955  but an explosion damaged the aircraft just before launch. Walker  unhurt  climbeed back into the JTB-29A mothership  and the X-1A was jettisoned over the Edwards AFB bombing range.  See: http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=E-1758,LER,photo

The NASA-improved X-ray fluorescence (XRF) scanners have been particularly well received in museums  where they are used to authenticate artifacts and works of art and assist those who conserve them. The scanner’s ability to detect the elemental composition of an object with a simple  nondestructive scan makes it ideal for analyzing precious  rare  or delicate items. Kaiser estimates that more than 600 museums and universities worldwide now use the device  including such institutions as the National Archives  the Field Museum of Natural History  the Louvre  the National Gallery  and the British Museum.   One reason the device is so popular is that experts in art history or archeology can easily be taught how to use it. “It doesn’t take a chemist to operate it ” says Bruce Kaiser  a scientist and pioneer in XRF technology  “I can teach anyone how to point the scanner  look at the color pattern  and figure out what they’ve got.”   As a practical example of the technology’s impact  Kaiser cites art authentication: “I can make something look yellow  but there are a hundred different ways to make something look yellow. Van Gogh only used one. If a museum is eyeing a newly discovered painting  it might be beautiful  it might have the right style and details  but if the elements in the pigments don’t match what Van Gogh used  then you know it’s not his. And yet the museum was about to spend $2 million on it.”   Read more: http://go.usa.gov/jxad And even more: http://go.usa.gov/jxaF,LER,photo

Slow and steady!  The crawlers are unique in the world  having been built in 1965 to move the massive Saturn V rocket from Kennedy’s Vehicle Assembly Building to Launch Complex 39. After the moon landing and Skylab programs ended  the crawlers continued their work  taking space shuttles to their launch pads for 30 years.  With the shuttle fleet retired in 2011  the crawlers are envisioned as critical elements of future launch operations at Kennedy. One is expected to take commercially operated rockets and spacecraft to the launch pad.

Early Years at Marshall  Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) offers a great example of how the development of a NASA center created mini melting pots of cultures  from around the country and world   united in pursuing engineering and scientific challenges.     “Graduates of southern universities predominated among new employees in Huntsville  but people came from around the nation. Art Sanderson  who made recruiting trips as part of his responsibilities in the personnel office  recalled that ‘They wanted top-notch engineers and we had a charter to go all over this country to get them.’ [William] Snoddy  a die-hard Crimson Tide fan  said that the diverse origins of his fellow workers became most noticeable during football season. ‘It was really strange to be in Alabama and yet work around people that didn’t care ’ he laughed. ‘They had these weird teams they were cheering for.

Launching Balloons to Study Space Weather  In Antarctica in January  2013 – the summer at the South Pole – scientists released 20 balloons  each eight stories tall  into the air to help answer an enduring space weather question: when the giant radiation belts surrounding Earth lose material  where do the extra particles actually go?  This NASA-funded mission is called BARREL  for Balloon Array for Radiation belt Relativistic Electron Losses.  See more http://go.usa.gov/baRG,LER,photo
"Dressing for Altitude U.S. Aviation Pressure Suits–Wiley Post to Space Shuttle"  By Dennis R. Jenkins Anybody who has watched many movies or television shows has seen them—the ubiquitous silver suits worn by pilots as they explore the unknown. They are called pressure suits  and one can trace their lineage to Wiley Post or  perhaps  a bit earlier.  There are two kinds of pressure suits: partial pressure and full pressure. David Clark  the man  once pointed out that these were not very good names  but they are the ones that stuck.   More...http://go.usa.gov/bcMe,LER,photo

Astronauts aboard the International Space Station took this photograph of Florida in October 2014. The peninsula is highly recognizable even at night  especially when looking roughly north  as our map-trained brains expect.  Illuminated areas give a strong sense of the size of cities. The brightest continuous patch of lights is the Miami-Fort Lauderdale metropolitan area  the largest urban area in the southeastern U.S. and home to 5.6 million people. The next largest area is the Tampa Bay region (2.8 million people) on the Gulf Coast of the peninsula. Orlando  located in the middle  has a somewhat smaller footprint (2.3 million). A nearly straight line of cities runs nearly 560 kilometers (350 miles) along the Atlantic coast from Jacksonville  Florida  to Wilmington  North Carolina.  South of Orlando  the center and southern portions of the peninsula are as dark as the Atlantic Ocean  vividly illustrating the almost population-free Everglades wetland. The lights of Cocoa Beach trace the curved lines of Cape Canaveral and the Kennedy Space Center  an area well known to astronauts. Dim lights of the Florida Keys extend the arc of the Atlantic coast to the corner of the image. The small cluster of lights far offshore is Freeport on Grand Bahama Island (image right). The faint blue areas throughout the image are clouds lit by moonlight.  #ISS #Earth #Florida,HER,photo

Streaming is now LIVE!! For Project Morpheus free flight.  Ignition still targeted for 3pm. ,LER,link
Looks like Project Morpheus continues on track for ignition at 3 p.m. EDT.   Streaming goes live 20 minutes before #FreeFlight  and can be watched at: http://1.usa.gov/1m8LI8y  Project Morpheus integrates NASA's automated landing and hazard avoidance technology with an engine that runs on liquid oxygen and methane  or "green" propellants  into a fully operational lander that could deliver cargo to asteroids and other planetary surfaces. Morpheus and ALHAT are examples of the partnerships that exist within the agency since seven of the 10 NASA centers have contributed time  energy and resources to both.    During today's 98-second test  Morpheus will ascend from the ground over the flame trench to a maximum altitude of more than 800 feet at a peak speed of 36 mph. Morpheus then will fly forward and downward covering approximately 1 300 feet while performing a 78-foot divert to simulate a hazard avoidance maneuver. The test is being performed with ALHAT operating in an open-loop mode  scanning the hazard field and identifying safe landing sites during flight  but not yet navigating the autonomous Morpheus vehicle.  ,LER,link

Earlier today  in McGregor  Texas  SpaceX conducted a test flight of a three engine version of the F9R test vehicle (successor to Grasshopper). During the flight  an anomaly was detected in the vehicle and the flight termination system automatically terminated the mission.  Throughout the test and subsequent flight termination  the vehicle remained in the designated flight area. There were no injuries or near injuries. An FAA representative was present at all times.    With research and development projects  detecting vehicle anomalies during the testing is the purpose of the program. Today’s test was particularly complex   pushing the limits of the vehicle further than any previous test.  As is our practice  the company will be reviewing the flight record details to learn more about the performance of the vehicle prior to our next test.    SpaceX will provide another update when the flight data has been fully analyzed.,HER,status

Dragon V2’s revolutionary launch escape system  the first of its kind  will provide escape capability from the time the crew enters the vehicle all the way to orbit. Powered by SpaceX’s new SuperDraco engines  the system will enable Dragon V2 to land anywhere on Earth with the accuracy of a helicopter.  The 8 SuperDracos will produce up to 120 000 pounds of axial thrust  and can be deep throttled during propulsive landing and restarted multiple times if necessary.  And also – they’re 3D printed in Inconel. When Dragon V2 flies  it will be the first time that a printed rocket engine sees flight.,HER,photo

During tomorrow’s CRS-3 launch to station  SpaceX will attempt to recover Falcon 9’s first stage. This test is not a primary mission objective and has a low probability of success (30-40%)  but we hope to gather as much data as possible to support future testing.  After stage separation  when Dragon is well on its way to the ISS  the first stage will attempt to execute a reentry burn and then a landing burn over the Atlantic Ocean. Falcon 9 is carrying four landing legs  which will deploy partway into the landing burn. Eventually  SpaceX hopes to land the first stage on land.

Today is Perihelion -  Earth is closest to the Sun.  At 06:36 UT on January 4 Earth was only approx. 91.40 million miles (or 147.09 million km) from the Sun.   Why is that? Well  Earth is not in a circular orbit around the Sun. It actually is an elliptical orbit and around January 4th each year  we are at the spot closest to the Sun. And around July 4th we are at the furthest distance from the Sun. The difference is a good 3 million miles or 5 million km. A big distance in numbers but nothing major at the scale of the Universe.   And just because Earth is closest to the Sun today  you actually barely notice an increase in temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere. It's in the order of 1 or 2 degrees celsius only.   How about the Southern Hemisphere where it is currently summer? Does this closest approach to the Sun increase the temperatures down there there? Also not really since there is more ocean in the Southern Hemisphere and water is a great heat sink; cooling temperatures in the summer.   As we are traveling around the Sun at approx. 20 miles or 30 km per second  everyday increases or decreases our distance to the Sun. Until July 4 we are now moving further away again...

The most dominant feature on the Sun the past week has been quite a large  dark coronal hole (November 30 – December 4  2014).   Coronal hole are areas where the Sun’s magnetic field is open ended and where high–speed solar wind streams particles into space.  The area appears darker there because there is less material being imaged in this wavelength of extreme ultraviolet light.  At its widest point  the hole extends more than 50 times the size of Earth.    Credit: NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory (Little SDO),HER,video

A couple of days ago I posted a still image of the large active region AR2192 in the 171 angstroms view. You could see the coronal loops so very well.   Here is now a movie from October 26 covering about 50 hours. Look how this region continues to rotate towards the western limb of the Sun and at the same time also producing solar flares.   What's really beautiful is the interaction of all the coronal loops. Coronal loops are found around sunspots and in active regions. These structures are associated with the closed magnetic field lines that connect magnetic regions on the solar surface. Many coronal loops last for days or weeks  but most change quite rapidly.  Maybe it's just me  but I could look at this all day long! Well  I actually am... 24/7!   Credit: NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory (Little SDO),HER,video
A suite of NASA's Sun-gazing spacecraft have spotted an unusual series of eruptions in which a series of fast puffs forced the slow ejection of a massive burst of solar material from the Sun's atmosphere. The eruptions took place over a period of three days  starting on Jan. 17  2013. Nathalia Alzate  a solar scientist at the University of Aberystwyth in Wales  presented findings on what caused the puffs at the 2014 Royal Astronomical Society's National Astronomy Meeting in Portsmouth  England.  The sun's outermost atmosphere  the corona  is made of magnetized solar material  called plasma  that has a temperature of millions of degrees and extends millions of miles into space. On January 17  the joint European Space Agency and NASA's Solar and Heliospheric Observatory  or SOHO  spacecraft observed puffs emanating from the base of the corona and rapidly exploding outwards into interplanetary space. The puffs occurred roughly once every three hours. After about 12 hours  a much larger eruption of material began  apparently eased out by the smaller-scale explosions.  By looking at high-resolution images taken by NASA's NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory (Little SDO)  or SDO  and NASA's Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory  or STEREO  over the same time period and in different wavelengths  Alzate and her colleagues could focus on the cause of the puffs and the interaction between the small and large-scale eruptions.  "Looking at the corona in extreme ultraviolet light we see the source of the puffs is a series of energetic jets and related flares " said Alzate. "The jets are localized  catastrophic releases of energy that spew material out from the sun into space. These rapid changes in the magnetic field cause flares  which release a huge amount of energy in a very short time in the form of super-heated plasma  high-energy radiation and radio bursts. The big  slow structure is reluctant to erupt  and does not begin to smoothly propagate outwards until several jets have occurred."  Because the events were observed by multiple spacecraft  each viewing the sun from a different perspective  Alzate and her colleagues were able to resolve the three-dimensional configuration of the eruptions. This allowed them to estimate the forces acting on the slow eruption and discuss possible mechanisms for the interaction between the slow and fast phenomena.  "We still need to understand whether there are shock waves  formed by the jets  passing through and driving the slow eruption " said Alzate. "Or whether magnetic reconfiguration is driving the jets allowing the larger  slow structure to slowly erupt. Thanks to recent advances in observation and in image processing techniques we can throw light on the way jets can lead to small and fast  or large and slow  eruptions from the Sun."  Image info:  This combination of three wavelengths of light from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory shows one of the multiple jets that led to a series of slow coronal puffs on January 17  2013.

HMI (Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager) is one of the three instrument I am carrying. The HMI scientists have put together a Facebook site  HMI Science Nuggets  and a website describing more of their findings.  The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager extends the capabilities of the SOHO/MDI instrument with continual full-disk coverage at higher spatial resolution and new vector magnetogram capabilities. In other words  HMI provides us with about one terabyte of data a day. giving us insights into sunspots and their magnetic fields.  Read up about the biggest sunspots in Solar Cycle 24.,LER,photo

#Cosmochat  Question: How long did it take to plan and design NASA SDO?  I remember the very early days and it sure take a lot of time to put a space mission together.   Pre-Phase A- 1997 - After the launch of the Solar & Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) in 1995  solar scientists began thinking about what data they were still lacking that was necessary to do the science that they wanted to do. From this needs assessment and based on lessons-learned from the SOHO build  launch and data they began to develop the preliminary ideas for the next Heliophysics strategic mission.  For the SDO  Lockheed Martin  Solar and Astrophysics Laboratory was selected to build and operate the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)  and to build the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI). HMI would be operated and the huge data stream (~4 TB per day) managed at Stanford University  while the University of Colorado  Boulder would build and operate the Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE).  Phase A- 2002- The deliverable at the end of Phase A is System Concept Study report which contains  more specific instrument requirements  a more complete budget.   Phase B- 2003- During Phase B  the preliminary plan is converted into a baseline technical solution - requirements are further defined  schedules are determined  and specifications are prepared to initiate system design and development. The deliverable at the end of the phase is the Preliminary Design review document  which sets out very specific requirements for the build and testing of the instruments down to how many threads a bolt will have  and the exact pressure that will be used to attach said bolt.  Phase C and D- Build  Integration and Testing- 2004 Phase C represents the beginning of the implementation stage. The Phase C deliverable is the Critical Design Review  There is a lot of activity in Phase C including: ·      Procurement of all aspects of the space craft o   Announcements of opportunity go out in 2005 for technical aspects of the space craft.  These announcements unlike the instrument announcements contain of the design and technical specifications required. o   Manpower profile peak- All manners of engineers are modeling  building and testing every aspect of the spacecraft for various factors  operations  ability to withstand space  integration with other spacecraft instruments and bus. o   HMI  EVE and AIA are built onsite at the subcontract locations o   The Testing of all of the parts of the spacecraft in the thermal vacuum chambers and on the vibration tables to ensure that they are space ready. Phase D Deliverable is the pre-ship review  and the completed and launched spacecraft. o     At this point there is a comprehensive audit in which all of the procurements are matched up with budget items and check lists Launch an initial commissioning takes place during phase D.  Phase E- Science mission and Operations- 2010 During Phase E science data is collected and made available to the public for scientific investigations that take place around the world.  The mission is monitored 24 hours a day 7 days a week by the mission operations team at Goddard Space Flight Center.  The instruments are monitored and operated at their respective institutions.  To date SDO has met minimum mission success  meaning it has fulfilled all of the mission goals.  It has taken over 100 million images of the sun and served 4500 terabytes of data.  http://sdoisgo.blogspot.com/2013/06/how-long-did-it-take-to-plan-and-design.html,LER,photo

Yesterday  sky watchers around the NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville  Alabama  witnessed something amazing: A complex network of luminous arcs and rings surrounded the afternoon sun. "I've never seen anything quite like it " says eyewitness Bill Cooke  head of NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office. Solar physicist David Hathaway snapped this picture of the display.   The apparition is almost certainly connected to hurricane Sandy. The core of the storm swept well north of Alabama  but Sandy's outer bands did pass over the area  leaving behind a thin haze of ice crystals in cirrus clouds. Sunlight shining through the crystals produced an unusually rich variety of ice halos.  Credit: NASA/MSFC David Hathaway / Spaceweather.com,HER,photo

And here is my first video from today's rather huge solar flare. Right at midnight UT time the active region 1429 unleashed a powerful X5.4-class solar flare. X-class flares are the strongest of the flares. They are major events that can trigger planet-wide radio blackouts and long-lasting radiation storms.  It appears that right after the large X5.4 flare another slightly lower  X1 flare (5 times smaller)  occurred. You can clearly see a wave going across the Sun.   We are still gathering data and the Space Weather Forecast Lab will be having updates available soon.   Credit: NASA SDO,LER,video

Thank you Discovery News for listening two Sun/Solar stories in your Space Story of 2011. I truly think that the Epic Solar Flare story is worth watching and voting for. But I must admit  the other stories are as great! Go vote and have fun. ,LER,link
It's almost a little sad when you think about it: Originally as part of a much larger object  Comet Lovejoy has existed for billions of years  since the formation of the solar system. It has outlived countless species on Earth. Indeed  it existed before life on Earth! And now it will almost certainly be completely destroyed within 72hrs. That is a long time spent doing very litte  to have such a short remaining time doing so much. But while it may have gone through most of its existence unnoticed  the same can certainly not be said now as increasing numbers of astronomers and enthusiasts alike are following its spectacular demise. For ground-based observers  the comet is now all but lost in the blinding glare of the Sun. But for Sun-watching spacecraft such as SOHO and STEREO  it is an incresingly easy target to view  and that is exactly what we are doing.

A special treat today. Let's take a backstage look at how ESA Astronaut André Kuipers has been preparing for his mission to the International Space Station.   ESA astronaut André Kuipers will be making his second flight to the International Space Station later this year  where he'll embark upon a six-month stay in orbit.  The Dutch astronaut spent many months training internationally for the mission learning the intricacies of a much larger station to which ESA's Columbus module has been added since his last visit in 2004.  This video shows training in Europe  Russia and Japan for what will be ESA's 4th long duration mission.  Credit: European Space Agency,LER,video
SOHO Greats! - More Looks Under the "Covers" with SOHO/MDI  Two active regions and their subsurface structures are the main characters of another "inside story" from the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) instrument on SOHO. Active region 9393 (first set of sunspots) was studied in detail by a group led by Alexander Kosovichev at Stanford. Using data from the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) instrument on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft to infer the sub-surface structure beneath the region  the team found that such regions are comprised of many small magnetic structures that rise quickly from deep within the Sun.  Active region 9114 (second set of sunspots) was studied by another team led by Junwei Zhao  also of Stanford  using SOHO MDI to explore the structure beneath a sunspot to understand why they sometimes start rotating. Zhao's team discovered that there was a strong plasma vortex beneath the rotating sunspot and that the magnetic fields lacing the sunspot appeared to be twisted beneath the surface.  credit: SOHO/NASA/ESA,LER,video

I work as an electrical system design engineer on the overall system architecture for the Space Launch System (SLS) core stage flight avionics  specifically the Command Telemetry Controller (CTC). It’s an important  unique component  as the central communication portal for our vehicle core stage element.   During the mission  the two CTCs on the vehicle are the primary collectors of data for telemetry downlink.  The CTCs format the data stream from cameras  over a thousand sensors  and the flight computer’s operations. That data stream is directed to the vehicle radios for downlink to ground stations. While the vehicle is on the launch pad  the CTCs are the conduit between ground operations and the flight computers.  In this mode  the CTCs perform a critical safety function.   The biggest challenge of my current work is not only to make this complex electronic box work in a short period of time  but to integrate it with other boxes properly. It’s a fun and challenging job  but you really need to be enthusiastic about what you are doing in order to have such commitment. It’s rewarding work  and I feel patriotic about it because I’m helping provide America the next-generation heavy-lift vehicle that will carry astronauts safely on different missions.   It was always interesting to me to watch the shuttle flights on television when I was young because there are limited Space Programs available in Taiwan.  To be part of the SLS Program satisfies a dream I had when I was a kid  and I’m looking forward to watching the launch with my two daughters some day.  I’d advise anyone who has aspirations to work in space exploration to study hard  do the things you love to do and do not be afraid to make mistakes.,LER,photo

Man of Steel  ISRO bids a sombre farewell to its iconic leader  Dr. K. Radhakrishnan  who superannuated today. An efficient engineer  magnificent manager  an impeccable institution builder; and an inspiring leader – Dr. Radhakrishnan triumphantly led ISRO through many historic milestones in the last five years being at the helm of affairs.   He was conferred with Padma- Bhushan  the third highest Civilian Award in India  in 2014. A Distinguished Alumnus Awardee of both IIT Kharagpur and IIM Bangalore – he was recognised with several distinctions. Being in the top ten scientific personalities in 2014 by Nature Science Journal  The Allan D Emil Award of International Astronautical Federation are some of glimpses of his international recognition.   After completing his graduation in Electrical Engineering from Kerala University  he joined Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) in 1971 and rose through the ranks  in brisk pace. He was handpicked by Prof. Satish Dhawan – the then Chairman of ISRO  to control and monitor the Budget and Economic Analysis activities at ISRO Head Quarters. By then he had completed his post graduation from the Indian Institute of Management  Bangalore. He bloomed to full glory at ISRO during 1981-2000 – in a period when he occupied several coveted positions like Project Director for establishment of Regional Remote Sensing Centers  Director of Budget and Economic Analyses  Program Director for National Natural Resource Management Systems and Mission Director of Integrated Mission of Sustainable Development and Deputy Director at the National Remote Sensing Agency (NRSA)  Hyderabad. Meanwhile he also completed his PhD from Indian Institute of Technology  Kharagpur.   During 2000-2005 he had a small stint at Ministry of Earth Science – where he established the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) and India’s Tsunami Warning Centre.   He came back to ISRO as Director of NRSA and went on to become the Director of VSSC  his alma-mater at ISRO. After delivering five consecutive successful PSLV missions including the PSLV-C11 that lofted Chandrayaan-1 and leading several crucial technology development at VSSC – he took over the reins of Indian Space Programme in November 2009; and the rest are matters of legend.   With the 12 successful PSLV missions  the successful GSLV with indigenous cryogenic stage  the Mars Orbiter Mission  the LVM-3 experimental flight with CARE module  the Six INSAT/GSAT satellites  three navigation Satellites and Six Earth Observation satellites (including RISAT-1  the first microwave imaging satellite)  Dr. Radhakrishnan is leaving  ISRO at its most glorified pedestal ever.   Team ISRO is determined –to strive harder to match the standard that he set and of course carry the organization to much higher level from here.   Sir  it has really been an honour for all of us to be a part of your team - wishing you the very best for all your future endeavours!,HER,photo

ISRO's LVM 3 X flight is planned on December 18  2014.  Experimental flight of LVM-3 will carry active Solid boosters (S200s)  Liquid core stage (L110) and a passive Cryogenic stage (C25).  The primary objective of this experimental flight is to validate the complex atmospheric ascent regime of this all new launcher  especially the aerodynamic and control features that cannot be conclusively tested on ground.  In this sub-orbital flight  the launcher would climb to an altitude of about 125 km. Taking advantage of this opportunity  a CARE (Crew-module Atmospheric Re-entry Experiment) Module is planned to be injected at this altitude. This module has been realized to validate a number of technologies developed under ISRO’s “Critical Technologies for Human Spaceflight Programme”. This Module is planned to be recovered from the Bay of Bengal after the splash down.,HER,photo

When two black holes collide  they release massive amounts of energy in the form of gravitational waves that last a fraction of a second and can be "heard" throughout the universe - if you have the right instruments.   Today we learned that the #LIGO project heard the telltale chirp of black holes colliding  fulfilling Einstein's General Theory of Relativity.   NASA's LISA mission will look for direct evidence of gravitational waves. http://go.nasa.gov/23ZbqoE  This video illustrates what that collision might look like.,HER,video

Today  Feb.  11  2015 marks five years in space for NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory  or SDO  which provides incredibly detailed images of the Earth-facing side of the sun 24 hours a day. Capturing an image almost once per second  SDO has provided an unprecedentedly clear picture of how massive explosions on the sun grow and erupt ever since its launch in 2010. More: http://go.nasa.gov/1FyHz91  In honor of SDO's fifth anniversary  NASA has released a video showcasing highlights from the last five years of sun watching. The first is a time lapse of the past five years. Different colors represent different wavelengths of extreme ultraviolet light  ultraviolet light  and visible light  which in turn correspond to solar material at different temperatures.,HER,video
Curly-Q Filament Blast A solar filament erupted in the shape of a twisted arch over a three-hour period (Feb. 4  2015) with most of it falling back into the Sun.

However  seeing three moons transiting the face of Jupiter at the same time is rare. This time-lapse video  which compresses 42 minutes' duration  shows the progression of the moons Io (right)  Callisto (center)  and Europa (left). The moons' orbital velocities are proportionally slower with increasing distance from the planet.  Credit: NASA  ESA  and the Hubble Heritage Team and G. Bacon (STScI/AURA),HER,video
The far side of the moon  like the side we can see from Earth  goes through a complete cycle of phases. But unlike the side we can see  the terrain of the far side is quite different. Learn more: http://go.nasa.gov/1KcDj1C & www.nasa.gov/lro  The far side of the moon lacks the large dark spots  called maria  that make up the familiar Man in the Moon on the near side. Instead  craters of all sizes crowd together over the entire far side. The far side is also home to one of the largest and oldest impact features in the solar system  the South Pole-Aitken basin  visible here as a slightly darker bruise covering the bottom third of the disk.  The far side was first seen in a handful of grainy images returned by the Soviet Luna 3 probe  which swung around the Moon in October  1959. The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter  or LRO  was launched fifty years later  and since then it has returned hundreds of terabytes of data  allowing LRO scientists to create extremely detailed and accurate maps of the far side. Those maps were used to create the imagery seen here.  More on Facebook here: httpsa//httpsa//www.facebook.com/LunarReconnaissanceOrbiteraaahttpsa//www.facebook.com/,HER,video
On the Edge of Mercury  In this image  Mercury's horizon cuts a striking edge against the stark blackness of space. On the right  sunlight harshly brings the landscape into relief while on the left  the surface is shrouded in the darkness of night.  This image was acquired as part of MDIS's limb imaging campaign. Once per week  MDIS captures images of Mercury's limb  with an emphasis on imaging the southern hemisphere limb. These limb images provide information about Mercury's shape and complement measurements of topography made by the Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA) of Mercury's northern hemisphere.  The MESSENGER spacecraft is the first ever to orbit the planet Mercury  and the spacecraft's seven scientific instruments and radio science investigation are unraveling the history and evolution of the Solar System's innermost planet. In the mission's more than three years of orbital operations  MESSENGER has acquired over 250 000 images and extensive other data sets. MESSENGER is capable of continuing orbital operations until early 2015.  Credit: NASA/Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory/Carnegie Institution of Washington,HER,photo

Preliminary data show that all four payloads worked as planned and the trimethyl aluminum  or TMA  vapor trails were seen at the various land-based observation sites in Alaska. A fifth rocket carrying the Auroral Spatial Structures Probe remains ready on the launch pad. The launch window for this experiment runs through Jan. 27.,HER,photo
Zoom into the Andromeda galaxy  The largest NASA Hubble Space Telescope image ever assembled  this sweeping view of a portion of the Andromeda galaxy (M31) is the sharpest large composite image ever taken of our galactic neighbor. Though the galaxy is over 2 million light-years away  the Hubble telescope is powerful enough to resolve individual stars in a 61 000-light-year-long section of the galaxy's pancake-shaped disk. It's like photographing a beach and resolving individual grains of sand. And  there are lots of stars in this sweeping view — over 100 million  with some of them in thousands of star clusters seen embedded in the disk. This ambitious photographic cartography of the Andromeda galaxy represents a new benchmark for precision studies of large spiral galaxies which dominate the universe's population of over 100 billion galaxies. Never before have astronomers been able to see individual stars over a major portion of an external spiral galaxy. Most of the stars in the universe live inside such majestic star cities  and this is the first data that reveal populations of stars in context to their home galaxy.  Credit: NASA  ESA  and G. Bacon (STScI),HER,video
Hubble Goes High Def to Revisit the Iconic 'Pillars of Creation'  Although NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope has taken many breathtaking images of the universe  one snapshot stands out from the rest: the iconic view of the so-called “Pillars of Creation.” The jaw-dropping photo  taken in 1995  revealed never-before-seen details of three giant columns of cold gas bathed in the scorching ultraviolet light from a cluster of young  massive stars in a small region of the Eagle Nebula  or M16.  Though such butte-like features are common in star-forming regions  the M16 structures are by far the most photogenic and evocative. The Hubble image is so popular that it has appeared in movies and television shows  on T-shirts and pillows  and even on a postage stamp.  And now  in celebration of its upcoming 25th anniversary in April  Hubble has revisited the famous pillars  providing astronomers with a sharper and wider view. As a bonus  the pillars have been photographed in near-infrared light  as well as visible light. The infrared view transforms the pillars into eerie  wispy silhouettes seen against a background of myriad stars. That’s because the infrared light penetrates much of the gas and dust  except for the densest regions of the pillars. Newborn stars can be seen hidden away inside the pillars. The new images are being unveiled at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Seattle.  Read more: http://1.usa.gov/1vZEEzf,HER,photo

Five hundred million years after the sun was born  Jupiter’s massive gravity disrupts countless asteroids and comets.  These hammer down on the inner planets.  Did this impact deliver water and organics? The key ingredients to life?   The Origins Spectral Interpretation Resource Identification Security -- Regolith Explorer spacecraft (OSIRIS-REx) will travel to a near-Earth asteroid  called Bennu  and bring a sample back to Earth for study. The mission will help scientists investigate how planets formed and how life began  as well as improve our understanding of asteroids that could impact Earth.  OSIRIS-REx is scheduled for launch in late 2016. As planned  the spacecraft will reach its asteroid target in 2018 and return a sample to Earth in 2023.

'Ghost Light' from Dead Galaxies encountered by Hubble  NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope has picked up the faint  ghostly glow of stars ejected from ancient galaxies that were gravitationally ripped apart several billion years ago. The mayhem happened 4 billion light-years away  inside an immense collection of nearly 500 galaxies nicknamed “Pandora’s Cluster ” also known as Abell 2744.  The scattered stars are no longer bound to any one galaxy  and drift freely between galaxies in the cluster. By observing the light from the orphaned stars  Hubble astronomers have assembled forensic evidence that suggests as many as six galaxies were torn to pieces inside the cluster over a stretch of 6 billion years.

NASA Identifies Ice Cloud Above Cruising Altitude on Titan  NASA scientists have identified an unexpected high-altitude methane ice cloud on Saturn's moon Titan that is similar to exotic clouds found far above Earth's poles.  This lofty cloud  imaged by NASA's Cassini spacecraft  was part of the winter cap of condensation over Titan's north pole. Now  eight years after spotting this mysterious bit of atmospheric fluff  researchers have determined that it contains methane ice  which produces a much denser cloud than the ethane ice previously identified there.

The Sun blew out a powerful coronal mass ejection (CME) from just around the edge of the Sun (Oct. 14  2014). The particle cloud expanded around all the Sun in a rough circle  hence the name 'halo' CME. This event was also associated with a fairly strong flare. The active region that was the source of these events is just rotating into view. Then  we can better observe its size and structure.

NASA'S STEREO (Behind) satellite captured this magnificent coronal mass ejection (associated with an M-class flare) that flung a long stream of plasma into space (Aug. 24  2014). We have combined a view of the Sun in extreme UV light with a broader visible light view of the Sun's corona. It is interesting to note that a lot of the plasma  lacking sufficient kinetic energy to break free from the Sun's gravity  was pulled back into the Sun.   Credit: NASA/Goddard/STEREO,HER,video
On August 24  2014  the sun emitted a mid-level solar flare  peaking at 8:16 a.m. EDT.  Here are some captured images of the flare  which erupted on the left side of the sun. Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation. Harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth's atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground  however -- when intense enough -- they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where GPS and communications signals travel.  This flare is classified as an M5 flare. M-class flares are ten times less powerful than the most intense flares  called X-class flares.

David Bowie has died. It leaves me and  I suspect  millions around the world  with an instant feeling of loss and emptiness - and yet also a wistful joy  a sense of how creative and inspirational just one of us can be. His art defined an image of outer space  inner self  and a rapidly changing world for a generation finding themselves at the confluence.  I am honoured to have been able to return some of that favour. Being able to record Oddity (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaOC9danxNo) on the International Space Station was an attempt to bring that art full circle. It was meant as a way to allow people to experience  without it being stated  that our culture had reached beyond the planet. We live in space. I thank him for allowing us the opportunity  and for being so kind since.  These past two weeks I had watched and listened to David twice: once absorbing Lazarus (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-JqH1M4Ya8) from his new album  and once re-watching the recording he did of Little Drummer Boy with Bing Crosby (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kfdEyV3RQ). To me they are lovely  thoughtful moments  insights into in his relentless creativity. Bookends of intimacy spanning a life  both which make me want to watch them again and again. If you haven’t seen them  I recommend you take the time.  With much respect to a genius  a silent moment of reflection: ashes to ashes  dust to stardust. Your brilliance inspired us all.

The annual eta Aquariid meteor shower will be best observed just before dawn tomorrow morning. Peak rates are normally around 40 meteors per hour  but the gibbous Moon will wash out the fainter etas  resulting in about 15-20 per hour under clear skies. This debris from Comet Halley hits Earth's atmosphere at a whopping 147 000 miles per hour (66 kilometers per second) and starts ablating (burning up) at altitudes around 68 miles (110 kilometers); most are vaporized by the time they reach 56 miles (90 kilometers) above the Earth's surface. The radiant rises late  so don't expect to see many etas before 3 AM local time.  Our all sky cameras have detected 22 eta Aquariid fireballs since April 29. The photo shows a -5 magnitude eta Aquariid captured by the Huntsville camera in the wee morning hours (3:33 AM CDT) of May 4.,HER,photo
Fireball over Pennsylvania!  This morning (2015 February 17)  a space rock about 2 feet in diameter and weighing roughly 500 pounds entered Earth’s atmosphere above western Pennsylvania. First detected by 3 NASA meteor cameras at an altitude of 60 miles above Beaver Falls  the fireball moved almost due east at a speed of 45 000 miles per hour. It flared brighter than the Full Moon before the cameras lost track of it at an altitude of 13 miles above the town of Kittanning; there may be fragments (meteorites) scattered on the ground east of that location. This celestial visitor had an orbit that took it out to the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter - it came a mightly long way to a fiery end in the predawn Pennsylvania sky.,HER,video

Apps to help you count meteors:  The Meteor Counter application for iOS and Android smartphones records your meteor counts and sends the data to a server where we can access it. Make a contribution to our understanding of meteors!  Android version: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.meteorcounter.MeteorCounter  iOS version: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/meteor-counter/id466896415?mt=8,LER,link
How High Up?  The advantage of having multiple cameras in an area is that they allow us to triangulate and determine the meteor trajectories. It is interesting to look at the heights where meteors start ablating and where they cease emitting light  either due to ablating away completely  or  more rarely  due to decelerating below 2.5 miles per second  at which point the meteor is moving too slow to produce light.  Danielle put together this plot showing the distribution of the end heights of Perseids. Note that half burn up between 55 and 60 miles above our heads  a fair number make it down to 50 miles  and that less than a one third of a percent get below 45 miles altitude. Cometary material - the Perseids come from Comet Swift-Tuttle - is very fragile  and these altitudes are not at all surprising given that a Perseid hits the atmosphere at 130 000 mph.,LER,photo
Meteor rates continue to increase; our NMSU camera recorded two simultaneous meteors around 5:22 AM. The one on the right is definitely a Perseid  as you can see from this starmap overlay (Perseid radiant is the + labeled PER):  http://fireballs.ndc.nasa.gov/special/PER_2012/two_meteors_2012Aug11.jpg  The other might be a Gamma Eridanid - it has the right speed and passes close to the radiant (GER on the starmap).,LER,video
Another Perseid captured from Discovery during the STS-105 mission. You can see the meteor flash near the upper left corner at the beginning of the video; the lights of Mongolia are seen in the earth below.,LER,video
Keeping Track of the Perseids....  Our cameras are neat  but we have nowhere near the "eyes" of the dedicated members of the International Meteor Organization. Their website contains a live graph of Perseid activity  updated by experienced meteor watchers from all over the world. If you want to know the current Perseid rate (or that of any major meteor shower)  it is THE place to visit.  http://www.imo.net,LER,link
STS-105 was a Shuttle mission ferrying crew and the Leonardo Multi Purpose Logistic Module to the International Space Station. Commanded by Scott Horowitz  Discovery launched on August 10  2001 and was closing on the ISS when one of the payload bay cameras recorded these two Perseids over the port wing.   In the video  you will see a faint Perseid about 1 second from the beginning at the Earth limb  just above the front wing tip. A much brighter Perseid occurs at the 9 second mark in roughly the same place; notice how both meteors move in the same direction.,LER,video
The Perseid rate continues to increase as we approach this weekend's maximum  and even Mother Nature is getting into the spirit. This bug paused its crawling around the dome of our Chickamauga camera as a Perseid blazed a fiery path 59 miles above it.  Now if we could only get it to leave so that it doesn't block part of the view :(,LER,video
The NASA fireball camera at the Tellus Museum in Cartersville  Georgia caught these nearly simultaneous fireballs at 5:44 AM EDT on May 6. The first is a faint streak just a bit above and to the right of the center of the image; the second - which is much brighter- immediately follows off to the right at the top edge of the clouds. These were not automatically picked up in our other cameras  so we do not have trajectories and cannot definitively identify them as eta Aquarids. However  an overlay of the star field (link below) suggests that they probably are  as the meteors appear to originate from close to the meteor shower radiant (the plus sign labeled ETA).  http://fireballs.ndc.nasa.gov/special/eAQR_2012/dbl_eta_Aqr.jpg,LER,video
What a difference location makes!  This mosaic captures the same fireball as seen by all 5 NASA cameras located in the SouthEast. In each image  north is to the top  west to the right  east left  and south at the bottom; note how the meteor changes position in the sky from location to location. These changes enable us to triangulate and determine the meteor's trajectory. The plot at the bottom right shows the meteor's path (orange arrow) relative to some of the camera stations (numbered + symbols),LER,photo
We have just completed installing our 7th all sky meteor camera at the Pisgah Astronomical Research Institute  located near Rosman  North Carolina. Our thanks to the folks at PARI for providing us with an excellent site!  http://www.pari.edu/,LER,photo
The NASA all sky meteor cameras detected 7 Eta Aquarid fireballs last night  6 of them between 3:45 and 4:30 a.m. PDT - a span of only 45 minutes! In this video  an Eta streaks at 152 000 mph above Las Cruces  New Mexico. At such speeds  the half-ounce piece of Halley's Comet lasts only a second before meeting a fiery demise 53 miles above Earth's surface.,LER,video
We have started going though the data from the balloon meteor camera  and are seeing a fair number of meteors! A probable Lyrid flashes across the left side of this video; Mars is at the top right and fainter Saturn is towards top left. The lights of Bishop  California and ranches in the Owens Valley shine at the bottom.  I was hoping for at least 1 or 2 meteors  but so far we have at least 14  maybe as many as 30  which is beyond our wildest dreams. Needless to say  we are quite excited!,LER,video
Astronaut sees meteors from space!  This in from astronaut Don Pettit aboard the International Space Station:  I collected four cameras running continuously during the three night passes on UT113.

I probably have 100Gb of images.  More later Don,LER,status

Update on Lyrid balloon flight  After a 3 hour journey  the meteor payload descended safely via parachute. However  it landed in a remote  hard to reach area of the White Mountains  so it will take time (days) for the recovery team to formulate a plan and get to it.  This is the first time the balloon team has had a payload land in such a tough area. Murphy's Law strikes again!,LER,status

The full exploration of Mars began in earnest in 1976  when the audacious Viking mission arrived at the Red Planet with not just one  but two spacecraft. Together  the Viking 1 and 2 orbiters captured many thousands of high-quality images of the surface. The U.S. Geological Service combined those images into a series of extraordinary mosaics.  Instead of focusing on one region or feature on the surface  these new compilations recreated how the entire face of Mars would look to an observer in a spacecraft flying about 2500 kilometers above the ground.

In October 2014  comet C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring) will pass extremely close to Mars at approximately 138 000km (~85 000 miles).  This perhaps doesn't sound very close  but this is a comet: an object that will have a long icy tail behind it and  crucially  a huge dusty/icy cloud (coma) surrounding it. Comet comae are big... very big... and there's a good chance that we are about to witness the first recorded instance in history of a planet passing through the coma of a comet!

Engineers are preparing to test the parachute system for NASA’s Orion spacecraft at the U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground in Yuma  Arizona. During the test  planned for Wednesday  Aug. 26  a C-17 aircraft will carry a representative Orion capsule to 35 000 feet in altitude and then drop it from its cargo bay. Engineers will test a scenario in which one of Orion’s two drogue parachutes  used to stabilize it in the air  does not deploy  and one of its three main parachutes  used to slow the capsule during the final stage of descent  also does not deploy. The risky test will provide data engineers will use as they gear up to qualify Orion’s parachutes for missions with astronauts. On Aug. 24  a C-17 was loaded with the test version of Orion  which has a similar mass and interfaces with the parachutes as the Orion being developed for deep space missions but is shorter on top to fit inside the aircraft.,HER,photo

As a senior software engineer working on Orion  I am responsible for software/hardware integration and testing to ensure all the spacecraft’s computer commands perform as expected for America’s next generation spacecraft destined for deep space.  Working with bits and bytes all day is much cooler than you might think. I get to simulate Orion missions almost every day  just as if we’re flying in space. I test the systems from launch  through flight and back to Earth. If I find any issues  I resolve them and retest to ensure a smooth and safe flight for our future crews.  As a young girl growing up in Gaza City  Palestine  watching the space shuttle takeoff and come back to Earth always amazed me. That’s what inspired me to become part of the space program.  I came to Houston to pursue my degree in engineering from the University of Houston at Clear Lake. Soon after graduation  I  began work on the Space Shuttle Program. When the shuttle retired I saw Orion as the new beginning for the next human spaceflight program  and I wanted to be part of it.  My advice to young girls around the world: Always have a dream  dream big  and work really hard to make your dream come true. Mine did.,HER,photo

Gravitational Waves Discovered from Colliding Black Holes  About 1.3 billion years ago two black holes swirled closer and closer together until they crashed in a furious bang. Each black hole packed roughly 30 times the mass of our sun into a minute volume  and their head-on impact came as the two were approaching the speed of light. The staggering strength of the merger gave rise to a new black hole and created a gravitational field so strong that it distorted spacetime in waves that spread throughout space with a power about 50 times stronger than that of all the shining stars and galaxies in the observable universe. Such events are  incredibly  thought to be common in space  but this collision was the first of its kind ever detected and its waves the first ever seen. Scientists with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) announced on Thursday at a much-anticipated press conference in Washington  D.C. (one of at least five simultaneous events held in the U.S. and Europe) that the more than half-century search for gravitational waves has finally succeeded.

Gravitational Waves and How They Distort Space  It’s official: on February 11  10:30 EST  there will be a big press conference about gravitational waves by the people running the gravitational wave detector LIGO. It’s a fair bet that they will announce the first direct detection of gravitational waves  predicted by Albert Einstein 100 years ago. If all goes as the scientists hope  this will be the kick-off for an era of gravitational wave astronomy: for learning about some of the most extreme and violent events in the cosmos by measuring the tiny ripples of space distortions that emanate from them.  Time to brush up on your gravitational wave knowledge  if you haven’t already done so!  Read more: http://buff.ly/1T2is6Q,HER,link

Moonset and Milky Way  Astrophotographer Brook Wassall submitted a photo of the moon setting  taken at Niarbyl on the Isle of Man  on Sept. 18  2015. Wassall writes in an email message to Space.com: "Here you can see the moon setting on the right [allowing] the Milky Way to shine [brightly] in the night sky. This was a bit of a tricky image to get as this was taken just after low tide  with the water slowly creeping into my shoes as I [balanced] myself on a couple of slippery rocks  but the low tide enabled me to get as far out as I could to capture the reflections of the [surrounding] light on the water. With the tide slowly creeping in further and further  and the moon quickly setting on the horizon  I had little time before the window of opportunity was gone. The Isle of Man sits in the middle of the Irish Sea  and although the island itself has very low light pollution  it is surrounded by the UK and Ireland which can shine quite [brightly] from across the sea in the night. The light pollution seen on the horizon in this image is actually coming all the way from Dublin  Ireland."   Image credit: Brook Wassall  Larger image: http://buff.ly/1QdAstM,HER,photo

Carl Sagan 1934 – 1996  He was a once-in-a-generation scientist who could make research both understandable and exciting to the lay public.  Carl Sagan arguably did more for the cause of science – and especially for astronomy and space research – than many of the personages featured in college textbooks.  Today is Carl Sagan’s 81st birthday; he died too young  at age 62.  But his formidable legacy continues to wield influence: anyone who has talked to students of astronomy has heard claims that they were attracted to the field thanks to Carl Sagan.   In addition to hosting the most popular science television show of its time (“Cosmos”)  Sagan authored more than a dozen books.  His efforts in the 1960s to make an early Russian tome  “Intelligent Life in the Universe ” available to English audiences brought SETI to the attention of mass audiences.  In addition to being a principal player in some of the most significant early explorations of our solar system (most notably  the Viking missions to Mars)  Sagan participated in some pioneering SETI experiments  and – in the last year of his life –became a member of the SETI Institute’s Board of Trustees.  He brought science into the living rooms and ultimately the consciousness of millions of people.  Few have done so much.,HER,photo

Here's What Happens If Intelligent Life Is Discovered  (Includes interviews with Seth Shostak and Jill Tarter.)  If all signs indicate that the signal is coming from another star  the astronomers contact other observatories or research organizations that subscribe to the Post-Detection Protocols to confirm a) that the signal exists  and b) that it’s likely coming from an intelligent source. If the other groups confirm the the signal  the original astronomers sound the alarm  alerting their national authorities of the discovery and sending an International Astronomical Union “telegram”—these days  an email—to observatories around the world. The guidelines also account for the United Nations’s 1967 Space Treaty  which calls for member states to notify the U.N. of their space-exploration activity—under the Protocols  the discovering astronomer alerts the Secretary General to the discovery  as well as a number of other international bodies.

Scientists are days from finding out if that mysterious star could actually harbor aliens   For the last week  Vakoch and his colleagues at the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute have been pointing the ground-based Allen Telescope Array in California at the enigmatic star with one goal in mind.  “We’re trying to rule out the hypothesis that maybe it’s intelligence out there ” Vakoch told Business Insider.  He added that they’re crunching the data in real-time and will  therefore  know if it’s ET within the next week  or so.,HER,link

The Most Mysterious Star in Our Galaxy   The light pattern suggests there is a big mess of matter circling the star  in tight formation. That would be expected if the star were young. When our solar system first formed  four and a half billion years ago  a messy disk of dust and debris surrounded the sun  before gravity organized it into planets  and rings of rock and ice.  But this unusual star isn’t young. If it were young  it would be surrounded by dust that would give off extra infrared light. There doesn’t seem to be an excess of infrared light around this star.  It appears to be mature.  Image credit:  Kevin Morefield  Read more: http://buff.ly/1X09Mi7,HER,link
Starting With the Earth as a Marble  This Is the First Timelapse of the Solar System to Scale  When looking in a science textbook or a toy mobile of the solar system  it’s easy to depict the sun  planets and moon to scale in comparison to each other.

APOD: 2015 July 20 - Comet PanSTARRS and a Crescent Moon   Discovered last year  Comet C/2014 Q1 (PanSTARRS) is expected to be visible now for a few days to the unaided eye  just after sunset  from some locations. The comet rounded the Sun on July 6 and apparently has shed quite a bit of gas and dust. Today it is now as close as it will ever get to the Earth  which is another factor in its recent great apparent brightness and the large angular extent of its tails.

What's large and blue and can wrap itself around an entire galaxy? A gravitational lens mirage. Pictured above  the gravity of a luminous red galaxy (LRG) has gravitationally distorted the light from a much more distant blue galaxy. More typically  such light bending results in two discernible images of the distant galaxy  but here the lens alignment is so precise that the background galaxy is distorted into a horseshoe -- a nearly complete ring. Since such a lensing effect was generally predicted in some detail by Albert Einstein over 70 years ago  rings like this are now known as Einstein Rings.   Although LRG 3-757 was discovered in 2007 in data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)  the image shown above is a follow-up observation taken with the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field Camera 3. Strong gravitational lenses like LRG 3-757 are more than oddities -- their multiple properties allow astronomers to determine the mass and dark matter content of the foreground galaxy lenses: http://buff.ly/16BixtM,HER,photo

People tend to think of gravity on Earth as uniform and consistent. But in fact  Earth’s gravitational field is subject to variations that occur over time. This is due to a combination of factors  like uneven distributions of mass in the oceans  continents  and deep interior  as well as climate-related variables like the water balance of continents  and the melting or growing of glaciers.  And now  for the first time ever  these variations have been captured in the image known as the “Potsdam Gravity Potato” –  a visualization of the Earth’s gravity field model.

Here's the beautiful Pillars of Creation in infrared. Image captured by the Hubble Space Telescope.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2015/01/image/f/  More about the image:   This NASA Hubble Space Telescope image  taken in near-infrared light  transforms the pillars into eerie  wispy silhouettes  which are seen against a background of myriad stars.  The near-infrared light can penetrate much of the gas and dust  revealing stars behind the nebula as well as hidden away inside the pillars. Some of the gas and dust clouds are so dense that even the near-infrared light cannot penetrate them. New stars embedded in the tops of the pillars  however  are apparent as bright sources that are unseen in the visible image.  The ghostly bluish haze around the dense edges of the pillars is material getting heated up by the intense ultraviolet radiation from a cluster of young  massive stars and evaporating away into space. The stellar grouping is above the pillars and cannot be seen in the image. At the top edge of the left-hand pillar  a gaseous fragment has been heated up and is flying away from the structure  underscoring the violent nature of star-forming regions.  Astronomers used filters that isolate the light from newly formed stars  which are invisible in the visible-light image. At these wavelengths  astronomers are seeing through the pillars and even through the back wall of the nebula cavity and can see the next generations of stars just as they're starting to emerge from their formative nursery.

NASA Spitzer - mapping cosmic carbon across the universe! http://www.nasa.gov/topics/universe/features/evolution-of-cosmic-carbon-pah.html  About the image: For the first time  scientists are able to automatically interpret previously unknown infrared emissions from space that come from surprisingly complex organic molecules  called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)  which are abundant and important across the universe. They use spectra of infrared radiation to identify unknown substances in space. These spectra are as good as fingerprints for identification purposes. Analyzing the PAH bands represents a powerful new astronomical tool to trace the evolution of cosmic carbon and  at the same time  probe conditions across the universe.

Pluto's newly discovered moons have been officially named! http://www.iau.org/public_press/news/detail/iau1303/ The James Webb Space Telescope will be able to study the surface chemistry of Pluto  its moons  and many other bodies that lie in the distant Kuiper Belt.  About the image: This discovery image  taken by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope  shows five moons orbiting the distant  icy dwarf planet Pluto. The darker stripe in the centre of the image is because the picture is constructed from a long exposure designed to capture the comparatively faint satellites of Nix  Hydra  Kerberos and Styx  and a shorter exposure to capture Pluto and Charon  which are much brighter. Kerberos has an estimated diameter of 13 to 34 kilometres  and Styx is thought to be irregular in shape and 10 to 25 kilometres across. Credit: NASA  ESA and M. Showalter (SETI Institute),HER,photo

Here is a summer appropriate image for you - an infrared image of the Fireworks Galaxy  taken by the Spitzer Space Telescope.  http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/images/2078-sig08-008-The-Fireworks-Galaxy-NGC-6946-  "NGC 6946  or "The Fireworks Galaxy"  is one of about a dozen nearby neighbors to the Milky Way. It is located approximately 10 million light-years away in the Cepheus constellation. This image was captured as part of the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxy Survey (SINGS) Legacy Project using the telescope's Infrared Array Camera (IRAC).  The "glowing" red emission reveals regions in the galaxy that are actively forming new stars. The blue dots sprinkled along this image are Milky Way stars along this line of sight.  The SINGS image is a four channel false color composite  where blue indicates emission at 3.6 microns  green corresponds to 4.5 microns  and red to 5.8 and 8.0 microns. The contribution from starlight (measured at 3.6 microns) in this picture has been subtracted from the 5.8 and 8 micron images to enhance the visibility of the dust features."

Infrared light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum - but just like visible light covers a range of different wavelengths (or colors as we see them)  infrared covers a range from near to mid to far infrared.    To illustrate that different infrared wavelengths can give us very different views of an object  here is a look at the Whirlpool galaxy.  (P.S. The James Webb Space Telescope has near and mid-infrared instruments  and combined with a 6.5 meter diameter mirror  will give us spectacular imagery.),HER,photo
How much gold is used to coat Webb's mirrors?  About a golf ball's worth!  Here's the calculation. The thickness of gold coating = 100 x 10^-9 meters (1000 angstroms). Surface area = 25 m^2. Using these numbers plus the density of gold at room temperature (19.3 x 10^-6 g/m^3)  the coating is calculated to use 48.25g of gold  about equal to a golf ball. (A golf ball weighs 45.9 grams.)

The image (on the left) has been posted everywhere today  but we couldn't resist posting it too  because it's so beautiful.  It shows galaxy M106 and was made by renowned astro-photographer Robert Gendler  who took data from the Hubble Space Telescope archive and combined it with his own ground-based observations.    We thought it was interesting to compare it to the image on the right  which is infrared data from Spitzer and X-ray data from Chandra.    Each wavelength gives a different view of the structure of this galaxy.   As Phil Plait notes  "...those red frills  streamers of gas at odd angles to the rest of the galaxy  one each on opposite sides of the galaxy’s core. These are called its anomalous arms  because they don’t line up well at all with M106’s more obvious spiral arms. The red color is a giveaway that we’re seeing gas being warmed by an outside source; hydrogen glows at that color when excited. So what’s the engine behind that?  It turns out  that gas is being zapped by twin blasts of energy coming from material being voraciously consumed by the galaxy’s supermassive central black hole."  Here's a NASA feature on the Gendler's image http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/m106.html  and Phil Plait's blog about the galaxy: http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2013/02/05/spiral_galaxy_m106_a_galaxy_zapped_by_its_own_black_hole.html  Credit (left): NASA  ESA  the Hubble Heritage Team (STScI/AURA)  and R.

Here's a stunning galaxy image for you this Friday.   "The NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope provides us this week with a spectacular image of the bright star-forming ring that surrounds the heart of the barred spiral galaxy NGC 1097. In this image  the larger-scale structure of the galaxy is barely visible: its comparatively dim spiral arms  which surround its heart in a loose embrace  reach out beyond the edges of this frame."

Over time  the storm has been stretched into the white band seen in the mid northern (upper) latitudes. This view  taken on March 12  2011  shows the late stages of the storm. It was taken using the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on the Hubble Space Telescope  with color data taken from earlier images of a previous storm by the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2). Three moons are visible above Saturn: Dione on the left  and Enceladus and Tethys on the right. Another speck at lower right is not a moon.

Each discovery  no matter how big or small  changes who we are. Artist's Concept of Kepler-452b Human's Concept of Life #NASABeyond  Artist's concept: NASA Ames/JPL-Caltech/T. Pyle,HER,photo
Close cousins?  Comparison between Earth and Kepler-452b and their host stars  Scientists using data from NASA's Kepler mission have confirmed the first near-Earth-size planet orbiting in the habitable zone of a sun-like star. The habitable zone is the region around a star where temperatures are just right for water to exist in its liquid form.  The artistic concept compares Earth (left) to the new planet  called Kepler-452b  which is about 60 percent larger. The illustration represents one possible appearance for Kepler-452b -- scientists do not know whether the planet has oceans and continents like Earth.  Both planets orbit a G2-type star of about the same temperature; however  the star hosting Kepler-452b is 6 billion years old  1.5 billion years older than our sun. As stars age  they become larger  hotter and brighter  as represented in the illustration. Kepler-452b's star appears a bit larger and brighter.  Image credit: NASA Ames/JPL-Caltech/T. Pyle & W. Stenzel,HER,photo
Welcome the discovery of the first small habitable zone planet around a G2 star like our sun: Kepler-452b! Press Release: http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-kepler-mission-discovers-bigger-older-cousin-to-earth,HER,photo
The first exoplanet orbiting another star like our sun was discovered in 1995. Exoplanets  especially small Earth-size worlds  belonged within the realm of science fiction just 21 years ago. Today  and thousands of discoveries later  astronomers are on the cusp of finding something people have dreamed about for thousands of years -- another Earth.  Tune-in 7/23 at 9a PDT for the latest discovery news!  It's an exciting week for exoplanets!,HER,link
Today NASA's Kepler mission announces the discovery of the first Earth-size planet in the habitable zone of another star!  Kepler-186f is less than 10% larger than Earth in size and orbits its star every 130 days. Although the size of Kepler-186f is known  its mass and composition are not. Previous research  however  suggests that a planet the size of Kepler-186f is likely to be rocky.  ,HER,link

Over the holidays at the end of 1992  Lloyd Robinson  the CCD guru at UCO Lick in those days  had just retired and offered to set up a CCD system in the clean room in Santa Cruz to see what could be learned.  This star plate was a key component in that original setup.    When Jon Jenkins (Co-Investigator and Analysis Lead for Kepler) first set eyes on this plate in June  2010  he recognized it immediately  even though he had never seen it before. This was because one of his first tasks for the mission was the analysis of an untold number of images from a variety of tests using this plate. These tests were invaluable in discovering all sorts of ways for test setups to go wrong  from sagging light bulb filaments to liquid nitrogen fills. Based on what was learned  more sophisticated laboratory test systems were developed using a variety of other star plates. This painstaking laboratory work culminated in the very successful Kepler Test Demonstration (KTD)  which was instrumental in selling the Kepler Mission to NASA.

[Know more] The habitable zone is the distance from a star where one can have liquid water on the surface of a planet. If a planet is too close to its parent star  it will be too hot and water would have evaporated. If a planet is too far from a star it is too cold and water is frozen. Stars come in a wide variety of sizes  masses and temperatures. Stars that are smaller  cooler and lower mass than the Sun (M-dwarfs) have their habitable zone much closer to the star than the Sun (G-dwarf). Stars that are larger  hotter and more massive than the Sun (A-dwarfs) have their habitable zone much farther out from the star.,LER,link

Latest News: Hubble Space Telescope astronomers have been able to pick up the faint infrared glow of a giant planet located 170 light-years away from Earth. Not only is it glowing  but also rhythmically flickering as the planet -- shown in this artist's interpretation -- spins on its axis like a top. The interpretation is that the subtle changes in the planet's brightness are due to a variegated cloud cover of comparatively bright and dark patches coming and going. These measurements have led to an estimate of how fast the planet is spinning through direct observation — a first for exoplanet astronomers. The gaseous world completes one rotation approximately every 10 hours  which  coincidentally  is the same rotation rate as Jupiter.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2016/05/,HER,photo
Latest News: First discovered in the 1960s  the comet-shaped “Smith Cloud” -- depicted in this artist's illustration -- is 11 000 light-years long and 2 500 light-years across. The cloud  which is invisible at optical wavelengths  is plummeting toward our galaxy at nearly 700 000 miles per hour.   Astronomers long thought that the Smith Cloud might be a failed  starless galaxy  or gas falling into the Milky Way from intergalactic space. If either of these scenarios proved true  the cloud would contain mainly hydrogen and helium  not the heavier elements made by stars.  Hubble was used to measure the chemical composition and found heavier elements that could only come from stars. The cloud appears to have been ejected from within the Milky Way and is now boomeranging back. It will plow back into the Milky Way's disk in about 30 million years. When it does  astronomers believe it will ignite a spectacular burst of star formation  perhaps providing enough gas to make 2 million suns.   Though this settles the mystery of the Smith Cloud's origin  it raises new questions: How did the cloud get to where it is now? What calamitous event could have catapulted it from the Milky Way's disk  and how did it remain intact? The answers may be found in future research.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2016/04,HER,photo
Latest News: Resembling an opulent diamond tapestry  this image from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope shows a glittering star cluster that contains a collection of some of the brightest stars seen in our Milky Way galaxy. Called Trumpler 14  it is located 8 000 light-years away in the Carina Nebula  a huge star-formation region. Because the cluster is only 500 000 years old  it has one of the highest concentrations of massive  luminous stars in the entire Milky Way. (The small  dark knot left of center is a nodule of gas laced with dust  and seen in silhouette.)  Diamonds are forever  but these blue-white stars are not. They are burning their hydrogen fuel so ferociously they will explode as supernovae in just a few million years. The combination of outflowing stellar "winds" and  ultimately  supernova blast waves will carve out cavities in nearby clouds of gas and dust. These fireworks will kick-start the beginning of a new generation of stars in an ongoing cycle of star birth and death.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2016/03/,HER,photo
Latest News: Astronomers have made the most detailed study yet of an extremely massive young galaxy cluster using three of NASA's Great Observatories. This multiwavelength image shows this galaxy cluster  called IDCS J1426.5+3508 (IDCS 1426 for short)  in X-rays recorded by the Chandra X-ray Observatory in blue  visible light observed by the Hubble Space Telescope in green  and infrared light from the Spitzer Space Telescope in red.  This rare galaxy cluster  which is located 10 billion light-years from Earth  is almost as massive as 500 trillion suns. This object has important implications for understanding how these megastructures formed and evolved early in the universe. Astronomers have observed IDCS 1426 when the universe was less than a third of its current age. It is the most massive galaxy cluster detected at such an early age.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2016/02/,HER,photo
Latest News: Just about anything is possible in our remarkable universe  and it often competes with the imaginings of science fiction writers and filmmakers. Hubble's latest contribution is a striking photo of what looks like a double-bladed lightsaber straight out of the Star Wars films.   In the center of the image  partially obscured by a dark  Jedi-like cloak of dust  a newborn star shoots twin jets out into space as a sort of birth announcement to the universe. Gas from a surrounding disk rains down onto the dust-obscured protostar and engorges it. The material is superheated and shoots outward from the star in opposite directions along an uncluttered escape route — the star's rotation axis.   Much more energetic than a science fiction lightsaber  these narrow energetic beams are blasting across space at over 100 000 miles per hour. This celestial lightsaber does not lie in a galaxy far  far away but rather inside our home galaxy  the Milky Way.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2015/42/,HER,photo
Latest News: Hubble has captured an image of the first-ever predicted supernova explosion. The reappearance of the supernova dubbed "Refsdal" was calculated by different mass models of a galaxy cluster whose immense gravity is warping the supernova's light as the light travels toward Earth.

Latest News: Most galaxies are clumped together in groups or clusters. A neighboring galaxy is never far away. But this galaxy  known as NGC 6503  has found itself in a lonely position  at the edge of a strangely empty patch of space called the Local Void.  The Local Void is a huge stretch of space that is at least 150 million light-years across. It seems completely empty of stars or galaxies. NGC 6503 is 18 million light-years away from us in the northern circumpolar constellation of Draco. NGC 6503 spans some 30 000 light-years  about a third of the size of the Milky Way.  This Hubble Space Telescope image shows NGC 6503 in striking detail and with a rich set of colors. Bright red patches of gas can be seen scattered through its swirling spiral arms  mixed with bright blue regions that contain newly forming stars. Dark brown dust lanes snake across the galaxy's bright arms and center  giving it a mottled appearance.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2015/23/,HER,photo

Astronomers Set a New Galaxy Distance Record  An international team of astronomers  led by Yale University and University of California scientists  has pushed back the cosmic frontier of galaxy exploration to a time when the universe was only 5 percent of its present age of 13.8 billion years. The team discovered an exceptionally luminous galaxy more than 13 billion years in the past and determined its exact distance from Earth using the combined data from NASA's Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes  and the Keck I 10-meter telescope at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. These observations confirmed it to be the most distant galaxy currently measured  setting a new record.

Happy 25th anniversary to the Hubble Space Telescope!   The brilliant tapestry of young stars flaring to life resemble a glittering fireworks display in this anniversary NASA Hubble Space Telescope image to commemorate a quarter century of exploring the solar system and beyond since the telescope's launch on April 24  1990.  The sparkling centerpiece of Hubble's silver anniversary fireworks is a giant cluster of about 3 000 stars called Westerlund 2  named for Swedish astronomer Bengt Westerlund  who discovered the grouping in the 1960s. The cluster resides in a raucous stellar breeding ground known as Gum 29  located 20 000 light-years away from Earth in the constellation Carina.  To capture this image  Hubble’s Wide Field Camera 3 pierced through the dusty veil shrouding the stellar nursery in near-infrared light  giving astronomers a clear view of the nebula and the dense concentration of stars in the central cluster. The cluster measures between 6 to 13 light-years across.  The giant star cluster is only about 2 million years old and contains some of our galaxy's hottest  brightest  and most massive stars. Some of its heftiest stars unleash torrents of ultraviolet light and hurricane-force winds of charged particles that etch at the enveloping hydrogen gas cloud.  The nebula reveals a fantasy landscape of pillars  ridges  and valleys. The pillars  composed of dense gas and thought to be incubators for new stars  are a few light-years tall and point to the central star cluster. Other dense regions surround the pillars  including reddish-brown filaments of gas and dust.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2015/12/,HER,photo
Our Sun came late to the Milky Way's Star forming party  Our Sun missed the stellar "baby boom" that erupted in our young Milky Way galaxy 10 billion years ago. During that time the Milky Way was churning out stars 30 times faster than it does today. Our galaxy was ablaze with a firestorm of star birth as its rich reservoir of hydrogen gas compressed under gravity  creating myriad stars. But our Sun was not one of them. It was a late "boomer " arising 5 billion years later  when star birth had plunged to a trickle.  Astronomers compiled this story of our Milky Way's growth from studying galaxies similar in mass to our galaxy  found in deep surveys of the universe. Stretching back in time more than 10 billion years  the census contains nearly 2 000 snapshots of Milky Way-like galaxies. The analysis comprises the most comprehensive multi-observatory galaxy survey yet  and includes data from the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS)  taken with NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.

#Hubble Finds Phantom Objects Near Dead Quasars  Dutch schoolteacher Hanny van Arkel discovered a never-before-seen ghostly structure near a galaxy  while she was participating in an online amateur scientist project called Galaxy Zoo.   The galaxy hosts a bright quasar that may have illuminated the apparition by hitting it with a beam of light from hot gas around a central black hole. Astronomers eagerly used the Hubble Space Telescope to do follow-up observations  which revealed knots of dust and gas in the "greenish blob."   Assuming that this feature could offer insights into the puzzling behavior of active galaxies  Bill Keel of the University of Alabama  Tuscaloosa  initiated a search for other similar phenomenon. After all  where there's one strange blob there could be more. Keel had 200 volunteers look at archival data of 15 000 galaxies hosting quasars. In the end  he found eight other galaxies with bright active nuclei that have illuminated material far outside the radius of the galaxy. The eerie structures have looping  spiral  and braided shapes. Hubble's images show that they are like the remnants of galaxy collisions.

Astronomers Find Dark Matter Even Darker  Astronomers using observations from NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope and Chandra X-ray Observatory have found that dark matter interacts with itself even less than previously thought by researchers. This finding narrows down the options for what this mysterious substance might be.  This collage shows images of six different galaxy clusters taken with NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope and Chandra X-ray Observatory. The clusters were observed in a study of how dark matter in clusters of galaxies behaves when the clusters collide. Seventy-two large cluster collisions were studied in total.  Using visible-light images from Hubble  the team was able to map the post-collision distribution of stars and also of the dark matter (colored in blue)  which was traced through its gravitational lensing effects on background light. Chandra was used to see the X-ray emission from impacted gas (pink).  The team determined that dark matter interacts with itself and everything else even less than previously thought.  The clusters shown here are  from left to right and top to bottom: MACS J0416.1–2403  MACS J0152.5-2852  MACS J0717.5+3745  Abell 370  Abell 2744  and ZwCl 1358+62.

NASA’s Hubble Observations Suggest Underground Ocean on Jupiter’s Largest Moon  NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope has the best evidence yet for an underground saltwater ocean on Ganymede  Jupiter’s largest moon. The subterranean ocean is thought to have more water than all the water on Earth’s surface.  Identifying liquid water is crucial in the search for habitable worlds beyond Earth and for the search of life as we know it.  “This discovery marks a significant milestone  highlighting what only Hubble can accomplish ” said John Grunsfeld  assistant administrator of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters  Washington. “In its 25 years in orbit  Hubble has made many scientific discoveries in our own solar system. A deep ocean under the icy crust of Ganymede opens up further exciting possibilities for life beyond Earth.”  Ganymede is the largest moon in our solar system and the only moon with its own magnetic field. The magnetic field causes aurorae  which are ribbons of glowing  hot electrified gas  in regions circling the north and south poles of the moon. Because Ganymede is close to Jupiter  it is also embedded in Jupiter’s magnetic field. When Jupiter’s magnetic field changes  the aurorae on Ganymede also change  “rocking” back and forth.  By watching the rocking motion of the two aurorae  scientists were able to determine that a large amount of saltwater exists beneath Ganymede’s crust affecting its magnetic field.

The Marvel of Gravitational Lensing by Dr. Frank Summers  One of the coolest marvels in the universe is a phenomenon known as "gravitational lensing". Unlike many topics in astronomy  the images are not what makes it appealing.

Latest News: Astronomers have used NASA's Hubble Space Telescope to take the most detailed picture to date of a large  edge-on  gas-and-dust disk encircling the 20-million-year-old star Beta Pictoris.  Beta Pictoris remains the only directly imaged debris disk that has a giant planet (discovered in 2009). Because the orbital period is comparatively short (estimated to be between 18 and 22 years)  astronomers can see large motion in just a few years. This allows scientists to study how the Beta Pictoris disk is distorted by the presence of a massive planet embedded within the disk.  The new visible-light Hubble image traces the disk in closer to the star to within about 650 million miles of the star (which is inside the radius of Saturn's orbit about the Sun).  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2015/06/,HER,photo

Latest News: Astronomers using #NASA's #Hubble Space Telescope have completed the largest and most sensitive visible-light imaging survey of dusty debris disks around other stars. These dusty disks  likely created by collisions between leftover objects from planet formation  were imaged around stars as young as 10 million years old and as mature as more than 1 billion years old.  Once thought to be simply pancake-like structures  the unexpected diversity and complexity of these dusty debris structures strongly suggest they are being gravitationally affected by unseen planets orbiting the star. Alternatively  these effects could result from the stars' passing through interstellar space.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2014/44/,HER,photo

The diminutive object is estimated to be over 13 billion light-years away.  This new detection is considered one of the most reliable distance measurements of a galaxy that existed in the early universe  said the Hubble researchers.   The galaxy appears as a tiny blob that is only a small fraction of the size of our Milky Way galaxy. But it offers a peek back into a time when the universe was only about 500 million years old  roughly 3 percent of its current age of 13.7 billion years.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2014/39/ #NASA,HER,photo
Hubble Finds Potential Kuiper Belt targets for New Horizons Mission   The Kuiper Belt is a vast disk of icy debris left over from our Sun's formation 4.6 billion years ago. Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) are a unique class of solar-system body that has never been visited by interplanetary spacecraft. They contain well-preserved clues to the origin of our solar system. NASA's New Horizons probe will fly by Pluto in mid-2015 and then continue across the Kuiper Belt on its way toward interstellar space. The Hubble Space Telescope was used to do a deep sky survey to identify KBOs that the New Horizons spacecraft could potentially visit on its outbound trajectory. The deep sky survey was successful  and Hubble found targetable KBOs for New Horizons.  Read more here: http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2014/47/,HER,photo
Hubble Maps the Temperature and Water Vapor on an Extreme Exoplanet  Located 260 light-years away  exoplanet WASP-43b is no place to call home. It is a world of extremes  where seething winds howl at the speed of sound from a 3 000-degree-Fahrenheit day side  hot enough to melt steel  to a pitch-black night side with plunging temperatures below 1 000 degrees Fahrenheit. The Hubble Space Telescope has been used to make the most detailed global map yet of the thermal glow from this turbulent world. The astronomers were also able to map temperatures at different layers of the world's atmosphere and traced the amount and distribution of water vapor. The Jupiter-sized planet lies so close to its orange dwarf host star that it completes an orbit in just 19 hours. The planet is also gravitationally locked so that it keeps one hemisphere facing the star.  Read more:  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2014/28/,HER,photo
Latest News: Astronomers have found an unlikely object in an improbable place: a monster black hole lurking inside one of the tiniest galaxies known. The dwarf galaxy containing the black hole  as illustrated in this artist's concept  is the densest galaxy ever seen  cramming 140 million stars within a diameter of about 300 light-years (just 1/500th of our Milky Way galaxy's diameter). However  the black hole inside the galaxy is five times the mass of the black hole at the center of our Milky Way. This suggests that the dwarf galaxy may actually be the stripped remnant of a larger galaxy that was torn apart during a close encounter with a more massive galaxy. The finding implies that there are many other compact galaxies in the universe that contain supermassive black holes. http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2014/41,HER,photo
This Hubble Space Telescope photo composite shows the location of supernova 1993J inside the majestic spiral galaxy M81.   Though astronomers saw the star explode as a supernova 21 years ago  the glow of that explosion is still present  as seen in the inset image. The supernova has faded to the point where astronomers are confident that they have picked up the ultraviolet glow of a very hot companion star.   This is the first time astronomers have been able to put constraints on the properties of the companion star in this unusual class of supernova called Type IIb. Hubble observations in ultraviolet light confirm the theory that the explosion originated in a double-star system where one star fueled the mass-loss from the aging primary star.

For over two decades astronomers have been patiently monitoring the fading glow of a supernova in a nearby galaxy. They've been looking for a suspected companion star that pulled off almost all of the hydrogen from the doomed star that exploded. At last Hubble's ultraviolet-light sensitivity pulled out the blue glow of the star from the cluttered starlight in the disk of the galaxy. This observation confirms the theory that the supernova originated in a double-star system where one star fueled the mass-loss from the aging primary star. The surviving star's brightness and estimated mass provide insight into the conditions that preceded the 1993 explosion.

Astronomers using the Hubble  Spitzer and Herschel Space Telescopes have discovered a tiny powerhouse galaxy from the early universe with a growing core that is blazing with the light of millions of newborn stars  forming at a ferocious rate.  Although only a fraction of the size of the Milky Way  the tiny galaxy already contains about twice as many stars as our galaxy  all crammed into a region only 6 000 light-years across. The Milky Way is about 100 000 light-years across. Astronomers think the fledgling galaxy will continue to grow  possibly becoming a giant elliptical galaxy.  Dubbed 'Sparky' by the astronomers who made the discovery  the young galaxy is churning out stars at a prodigious rate. Sparky is producing roughly 300 stars per year. By comparison  the Milky Way produces roughly 10 stars per year.  Read more here: http://hubblesite.org/news/2014/37,HER,photo
Latest News: Supernovae are the most powerful stellar explosions in the universe. Some of them are produced by the detonation of a white dwarf  the stripped-down core of an ordinary star at the end of its life. But 12 years ago  astronomers began noticing weak stellar blasts  a kind of mini-supernova. When one such explosion occurred in the galaxy pictured here  NGC 1309  astronomers looking through Hubble archival images found for the first time the star system that produced the supernova blast of a white dwarf. http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2014/32/,HER,photo
Hubble Finds Three Surprisingly Dry Exoplanets  Challenging current exoplanet theories  the Hubble Space Telescope observed three planets  HD 189733b  HD 209458b  and WASP-12b  which are between 60 and 900 light-years away. These giant gaseous worlds are so hot  with temperatures between 1 500 and 4 000 degrees Fahrenheit  that they are ideal candidates for detecting water vapor in their atmospheres.  However  to the surprise of the researchers  the planets surveyed have only one-tenth to one one-thousandth the amount of water predicted by standard planet-formation theories.  http://hubblesite.org/news/2014/36,HER,photo
Astronomers routinely use #Hubble's crisp view to study all kinds of intricate details in galaxy clusters. By now you would think they've seen it all — but nature always has new surprises in store.  The latest is an uncanny 100 000-light-year-long structure that looks like a string of pearls twisted into a corkscrew shape that winds around the cores of two colliding galaxies. This Slinky-like structure forms a bridge between two giant elliptical galaxies that are colliding. The "pearls" on the Slinky are superclusters of blazing  blue-white  newly born stars. The whole assembly  which looks like a tug-of-war  must result from the gravitational tidal forces present in the collision.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2014/26/,HER,photo
Hubble Observations to Identify KBOs for New Horizon Flyby Next July are scheduled.

Hubble Finds Dwarf Galaxies Produced a Large Proportion of the Stars in the Universe - and  they do it quickly!  Astronomers using the +Hubble Space Telescope studying dwarf galaxies from the early universe using the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) were able to calculate how much low-mass dwarf galaxies contributed to the star population in the universe.  “These galaxies are forming stars so quickly they could actually double their entire mass of stars in only 150 million years — an incredibly short astronomical timescale ” added co-author Jean-Paul Kneib  also of EPFL.  Astronomers say that such massive growth in a galaxy would take from 1 to 3 billion years in most 'normal' galaxies.  http://hubblesite.org/news/2014/25,HER,photo
Latest News: This image  from a new study called the Ultraviolet Coverage of the #Hubble Ultra Deep Field  provides the missing link in star formation.   Astronomers previously studied the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) in visible and near-infrared light in a series of images captured from 2003 to 2009. The HUDF shows a small section of space in the southern-hemisphere constellation Fornax. Now  using ultraviolet light  astronomers have combined the full range of colors available to Hubble  stretching all the way from ultraviolet to near-infrared light. The resulting image — made from 841 orbits of telescope viewing time — contains approximately 10 000 galaxies  extending back in time to within a few hundred million years of the big bang.  Ultraviolet light comes from the hottest  largest  and youngest stars. By observing at these wavelengths  researchers get a direct look at which galaxies are forming stars and where the stars are forming within those galaxies.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2014/27/,HER,photo

Latest News: Our spiral-shaped Milky Way galaxy lives in a comparatively quiet backwater region of the universe. This is not the case for galaxies crammed together inside huge clusters. As they zip around within a cluster  gas can be pulled from their disks due to a process called ram pressure stripping. Galaxy ESO 137  captured in this #Hubble image  is one example.

The densest galaxy in the nearby universe may have been found. The galaxy  known as M60-UCD1  is located near a massive elliptical galaxy NGC 4649  also called M60  about 54 million light-years from Earth. The arrow points to M60-UCD1.  Packed with an extraordinary number of stars  M60-UCD1 is an "ultra-compact dwarf galaxy." It is one of the most massive galaxies of its kind  weighing 200 million times more than our Sun. Remarkably  about half of this mass is found within a radius of only about 80 light-years. This would make the density of stars about 15 000 times greater than found in Earth's neighborhood in the Milky Way  meaning that the stars are about 25 times closer. http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2013/40/,HER,photo

Latest News: Hubble has identified the true visible-light color of a giant Jupiter-sized planet located 63 light-years away. The planet  depicted in the artist's illustration below  has a cobalt blue color. It has torrential 4 500-mile-per-hour winds that are so hot they melt silicates into raindrops of molten glass. And that's where the cobalt-blue hue comes from  not oceans. The glass droplets scatter blue light more readily than green or red light.  The planet's color provides unique clues to the atmosphere and weather on a truly alien world that orbits much closer to its star than the innermost planet Mercury is to our Sun.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2013/26/,HER,photo

Latest News: What looks like a celestial hummingbird is really the result of a collision between a spiral and an elliptical galaxy 326 million light- years away. The flat disk of the spiral NGC 2936 is warped into the profile of a bird by the gravitational tug of the companion NGC 2937. The object was first cataloged as a "peculiar galaxy" by Halton Arp in the 1960s. This interacting galaxy duo is collectively called Arp 142.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2013/23/,HER,photo

Nearly 900 extrasolar planets have been confirmed to date  but now for the first time astronomers think they are seeing compelling evidence for a planet under construction in an unlikely place  at a great distance from its diminutive red dwarf star.  Hubble has detected a mysterious gap in a vast protoplanetary disk of gas and dust swirling around the nearby star TW Hydrae  located 176 light-years away in the constellation Hydra. The gap is best explained by the unseen presence of a growing planet that is gravitationally sweeping up material and carving out a lane in the disk  like a snow plow.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2013/20/,HER,photo

Latest News: Hubble can track stellar motions to razor-sharp precision. The nearest star to our Sun  Proxima Centauri  is one of the fastest moving across the sky. Hubble astronomers have found that it will pass in front of two far-more distant background stars  once in 2014 and again in 2016. This will afford a very rare opportunity to see how Proxima's gravity warps the image of the background stars by bending their light. This effect  called gravitational lensing  can be used to estimate Proxima Centauri's mass and establish the presence of any planets orbiting the star.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2013/22/,HER,photo

Picture Post: This image is from a seven-day-long survey conducted in 2006 called the Sagittarius Window Eclipsing Extrasolar Planet Search (SWEEPS). Hubble peered at and obtained information for 180 000 stars in the crowded central bulge of our galaxy  26 000 light-years away. The survey was intended to find hot Jupiter-class planets that orbit very close to their stars. But the SWEEPS team also uncovered 42 oddball blue stars among the bulge population with brightness and temperatures typical for stars much younger than ordinary bulge stars.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/star/2011/16/,HER,photo

Latest News: New observations by #Hubble reveal a new twist on the Ring Nebula. The images show a more complex structure than astronomers once thought.  "The nebula is not like a bagel  but rather  it's like a jelly doughnut  because it's filled with material in the middle " said C. Robert O'Dell of Vanderbilt University in Nashville  Tenn. "With Hubble's detail  we see a completely different shape than what's been thought about historically for this classic nebula. The new Hubble observations show the nebula in much clearer detail  and we see things are not as simple as we previously thought."  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2013/13/,HER,photo

Picture Post: These Hubble snapshots capture merging galaxies at various stages in their collision. Astronomers estimate that only one out of one thousand galaxies in the nearby universe is in the act of colliding. However  galaxy mergers were much more common long ago when they were closer together  because the expanding universe was smaller.   For all their violence  galactic smash-ups take place at a glacial rate by human standards - timescales on the order of several hundred million years.   http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2008/16/,HER,photo

Picture Post: An eerie pillar of star birth in the Carina Nebula rises from a sea of greenish-colored clouds. Nestled inside this dense structure are fledgling stars. They cannot be seen in this image because they are hidden by a wall of gas and dust. Although the stars themselves are invisible  one of them is providing evidence of its existence. Thin puffs of material can be seen traveling to the left and to the right of a dark notch in the center of the pillar. The matter is part of a jet produced by a young star. Farther away  on the left  the jet is visible as a grouping of small  wispy clouds. A few small clouds are visible at a similar distance on the right side of the jet. Astronomers estimate that the jet is moving at speeds of up to 850 000 miles an hour. The jet's total length is about 10 light-years.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/solar%20system/2009/25/image/h/,HER,photo

Billions of years ago  shortly after the Big Bang  the universe was a dark place full of cold hydrogen gas. One of the mysteries of astronomy is what happened to change that  to warm and “reionize” the hydrogen and turn the universe once again transparent to light  blazing with stars and galaxies.  Hubble astronomers may have found some of the culprits  seven primitive galaxies that formed over 13 billion years ago. The galaxies are part of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field image and demonstrate that galaxies may have assembled continuously over time  and may have provided enough radiation to reionize the universe.

Welcome to a Week of Hubble Art on Facebook. Each day we're posting an artist's illustration that depicts a discovery from one of Hubble's news releases. Enjoy!  This artist's illustration shows a dramatic close-up of the scorched extrasolar planet HD 209458b in its orbit only 4 million miles from its yellow  Sun-like star.   The planet's outer atmosphere is extended and heated so much by the searing heat from the nearby star that it starts to escape the planet's gravity. This huge envelope of evaporating hydrogen (shown in blue) resembles a comet with a tail trailing behind the planet. Much of the planet may eventually disappear  leaving only a dense core.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2003/08/,HER,photo

Welcome to a Week of Hubble Art on Facebook. Each day we're posting an artist's illustration that depicts a discovery from one of Hubble's news releases. Enjoy!  This planet  estimated to be at least seven times Jupiter's mass  was originally discovered in images taken with the Keck and Gemini North telescopes in 2007 and 2008. It is the outermost of three massive planets known to orbit the dusty young star HR 8799  which is 130 light-years away. Astronomers combing though years of archived Hubble data were able to identify this planet  which went undiscovered in Hubble images taken in 1998.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2009/15/full/,HER,photo
The giant elliptical galaxy in the center of this image is the most massive and brightest member of the galaxy cluster Abell 2261.  Spanning a little more than one million light-years  the galaxy is about 10 times the diameter of our Milky Way galaxy. The bloated galaxy is a member of an unusual class of galaxies with a diffuse core filled with a fog of starlight. Normally  astronomers would expect to see a concentrated peak of light around a central black hole. Hubble observations revealed that the galaxy's puffy core  measuring about 10 000 light-years  is the largest yet seen.  The observations present a mystery  and studies of this galaxy may provide insight into how black hole behavior may shape the cores of galaxies.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2012/24/full/,HER,photo

Ever wondered what happens inside the International Space Station during a reboost? I filmed inside during last week's firing of the Progress thrusters.  Even at 400 km  there are still enough molecules of the atmosphere to create some 'atmospheric drag'  which causes the Station to drop by about 2 km a month. Because of this we need to raise the Station's orbit every so often. On 17 February the engines of the Progress M-29M spacecraft that is docked to the aft port of the Zvezda module were fired for 11 minutes.   The burn primarily focused on raising the Station’s perigee  making the orbit more circular.  Pre-reboost:  398.2 x 407.4 km - Inclination: 51.64° - Period: 92.62min Post-reboost: 402.1 x 406.9 km - Inclination: 51.64° - Period: 92.66min,HER,video

Hello! Just got time to do a couple more commonly asked questions.  1) How do we wash our clothes in space?  2) What happens to waste from the Space Station? We don’t have a washing machine so we wear the same clothes  including underwear  for several days before we change. It’s not as bad as it sounds. We live in temperature-controlled environment  so clothes don’t get as dirty as they might on Earth. Some of the items  like socks or our exercise gear  have anti-bacterial materials in them. We change our exercise kit every 3-4 days. We change underwear every two days. Then we have polo shirts  T-shirts  trousers and shorts that last a couple of weeks. Our used/dirty clothes are placed in a waste bag and put on a Progress supply spacecraft that undocks and then burns up in Earth’s atmosphere. This is also how we get rid of other rubbish  such as empty food packaging or our solid waste from the toilet  for example. That's it for now  have a good evening!,HER,status

Good evening! Thanks for all your Likes  comments and questions  your interest is just fantastic. I'm going to answer a couple of the most commonly asked questions here each week. So let's start with these:  1) What time zone do we use in space?  The Station runs to UTC (Universal Time Coordinated)  which is basically GMT  luckily for ESA and those of you in UK :-) This time zone was chosen because it’s 'in the middle' of all the ISS partners (USA  Canada  ESA  Russia and Japan) and each of the two main mission control centres  Houston and Moscow  gets to cover half a day shift.  2) What time do we go to bed  and do we all sleep at the same time? Yes we sleep mostly all at the same time. We’re supposed to get about 8 hours of sleep per day  but this varies and we can go to bed anytime from 10 p.m. to midnight.,HER,status

Sunrise strikes our solar panels – makes a beautiful sight (…oh and also provides all of our power too!)  (ESA - the four sets of solar arrays can generate 84 to 120 kW of electricity -- enough power for around 40 homes. This is more power than the Station actually needs at one time for its systems and experiments  so when the Station is in sunlight  about 60% of the electricity generated is used to charge the Station's batteries. At times  some or all of the solar arrays are in shadow  meaning those arrays are not collecting sunlight. Then the batteries power the Station when it is not in the Sun.),HER,photo

Been scanning through the 1000s of comments  and I have to say thank you very much to all. I can't answer everyone  but I noticed two of the most-often asked ones: why can't you see stars in my photos  and what will I eat for Christmas dinner? Very good questions!  1) The reason you can't see stars is the same as why you can't see any on Earth while standing under a street light for example. Earth is much brighter than the stars in the background. The stars are there if we look away from Earth but don't show up on photos because the camera cannot gather enough of their light in such a short exposure.  2) What's for Xmas dinner? I haven't decided yet  you'll have to wait and see!  Merry Christmas from space.,HER,status

The bending of light by a lens or by the atmosphere is an example of refraction  and is due to the change of the speed of light as it moves from one medium to another  such as from air to glass  or through air which is gradually changing in density. This behavior is an example of "the principle of least action " or in the special case of light  "the principle of least time " which means that the path taken by a ray of light is the path that can be traversed in the least time. http://hte.si.edu/light.html  #HTEscience,LER,photo

#TBT to July 1995: A NASA SR-71 Blackbird refuels mid-air with a KC-135 tanker.  As research platforms  the SR-71 could reach Mach 3 for more than one hour. For thermal experiments  this could produce heat soak temperatures of over 600 degrees Fahrenheit (F). This operating environment made these aircraft excellent platforms to carry out research and experiments in a variety of areas -- aerodynamics  propulsion  structures  thermal protection materials  high-speed and high-temperature instrumentation  atmospheric studies  and sonic boom characterization. The last flight of NASA's SR-71 was in 1999.  To learn more about NASA's SR-71 Blackbird  click here: http://go.usa.gov/3hReF,HER,photo

NASA Armstrong Chief Pilot Nils Larson shares his story of his first time flying a U-2 aircraft:    “#Myfirstflight in the U-2 was my first of three interview flights.  I couldn’t believe how hard this airplane was to fly.  Even watching the instructor fly the aircraft  it looked more like wrestling than flying an airplane.  After my flight I was so sore and tired that I ate dinner  went to bed and got up the next morning to start it all over again.  I later learned that you don’t wrestle the plane.  It’s called “The Dragon Lady” for many reasons.  Landing was never easy  even on a good day.  A wise old instructor told me  ”She’s a lady and you have to treat her like one. You can’t fight with a lady and win…you have to dance with her.  If you are lucky she’ll let you lead!”  When I left the U-2 after my first tour to go off to Test Pilot School  on my final flight I called  “ Gear down  Full stop.”  Tower responded  ”Roger Sir  you’re cleared for one last dance with The Lady.” I ending up spending two tours in the U-2 and flew the ER-2 for NASA for a few years.  It's still the hardest airplane I’ve had to fly out of the 100 different aircraft I’ve flown!”  Share your first flight story with us to celebrate #NationalAviationDay!,HER,photo
NASA Armstrong Research Test Pilot Jim "Clue" Less tells his #myfirstflight story:   "I grew up off the end of the Schenectady County Airport runway in New York State.  The Stratton Air National Guard Base is located on the airport and operates C-130s with skis flying to Antarctica with personnel and supplies.  So  I grew up watching airplanes  big and small  fly overhead.  I was always fascinated by airplanes and flying  but I didn’t know anyone who was a pilot  so I never really considered it as a career option growing up.  My family never traveled by plane  so I graduated from high school and had never flown.  I applied for Air Force ROTC and started college nearby at RPI.  Through ROTC  I took #myfirstflight in a C-130 at the Schenectady ANG  one of the same planes I grew up watching fly overhead.  Pretty soon I had earned my Private Pilot license and was accepted for USAF Undergraduate Pilot Training upon graduation from college.  Almost 30 years later I have around 4000 hours in dozens of aircraft ranging from the F-117 and F-16 to the 747 and unmanned aircraft.",HER,photo

#fbf  The Gossamer Albatross II was involved in slow-speed flight tests at the Dryden Flight Research Center  Edwards  Calif. in the spring of 1980. The original Gossamer Albatross is best known for completing the first completely human-powered flight across the English Channel on June 12  1979. Dr. Paul MacCready was later awarded the most prestigious prize in American aviation  the Collier Trophy  for his work in the record breaking project.  The Albatross II was the backup craft for the Channel flight. It was fitted with a small battery-powered electric motor and flight instruments for the NASA research project in low-speed flight. The minimal power required to fly this 94-foot-span aircraft suggested it could be solar-powered  and led to numerous later record breaking projects involving solar energy. NASA completed its flight testing of the Gossamer Albatross II and began analysis of the results in April  1980. During the six week program  17 actual data gathering flights and 10 other flights were flown here as part of the joint NASA Langley/Dryden flight research project. The lightweight craft  carrying a miniaturized instrumentation system  was flown in three configurations; using human power  with a small electric motor  and towed with the propeller removed.  Results from the program contributed to data on the unusual aerodynamic  performance  stability  and control characteristics of large  lightweight aircraft that fly at slow speeds for application to future high-altitude aircraft. The Albatross' design and research data contributed to numerous later high-altitude projects  including the Pathfinder.  #FlashbackFriday #Gossamer #Albatross  #NASAArmstrong  NASA Photo / Jim Moran,HER,photo
Dryden pilot Neil Armstrong is seen here next to the X-15 ship #1 (56-6670) after a research flight.  Armstrong made his first X-15 flight on November 30  1960  in the #1 X-15. He made his second flight on December 9  1960  in the same aircraft. This was the first X-15 flight to use the ball nose  which provided accurate measurement of air speed and flow angle at supersonic and hypersonic speeds. The servo-actuated ball nose can be seen in this photo in front of Armstrong's right hand.  The X-15 employed a non-standard landing gear. It had a nose gear with two tires  but the main landing consisted of skids mounted at the rear of the vehicle. In the photo  the left skid is visible  as are marks on the lakebed from both skids. Because of the skids  the rocket-powered aircraft could only land on a dry lakebed  not on a concrete runway.  1960 NASA Photo / NASA photo  #NASAArmstrong #ThisisArmstrong,HER,photo
This #ThrowbackThursday is for all of you Trekkies out there! Pictured here are Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry and some of the principle television cast in front of the Space Shuttle Enterprise at the dedication ceremony on September 17th  1976.  Enterprise was originally planned to be named Constitution and unveiled on Constitution Day (September 17th). However  a letter-writing campaign by Trekkies to the White House changed that when they asked that the orbiter be named after the Starship Enterprise  featured on the television show Star Trek.   Although the Enterprise never flew in space  it was used to test critical phases of landing and other aspects of shuttle preparations. The shuttle was mounted on top of a modified 747 airliner and released over the dry lakebed at Edwards Air Force Base  California to prove it could glide and land safely.

#FlashbackFriday #fbf  The X-3 Stiletto pictured sitting on the lakebed at Edwards Air Force Base in 1954.    The X-3 had the most unusual pilot entry mode of any X-plane: the seat descended beneath the fuselage like an elevator  and once the pilot was seated  he and the seat rose back into the fuselage for flight.  The X-3 was a single-place jet aircraft with a slender fuselage and a long tapered nose  manufactured by the Douglas Aircraft Company. The X-3's primary mission was to investigate the design features of an aircraft suitable for sustained supersonic speeds  which included the first use of titanium in major airframe components.

This Week in Dryden History: April 20  1962 During re-entry from 207 000 feet in X-15-3 (56-6672)  Neil Armstrong inadvertently established a positive angle of attack during pull-out  and overshot Edwards AFB  heading south at Mach 3 and 100 000 feet altitude. He finally managed to turn back while over the Rose Bowl in Pasadena  and had just enough energy to land on the south end of Rogers Dry Lake at Edwards. In the debriefing  someone asked how much clearance the X-15 had from the Joshua trees on the edge of the lakebed. “Oh  at least 100 feet...on either side ” said the chase pilot.,HER,photo

Crewed by NASA astronauts Jack Lousma and Gordon Fullerton on its third orbital test mission  Columbia had been diverted from its planned landing at Edwards Air Force Base in Southern California due to bad weather the previous week having left Edwards' lakebed runways too soggy to support a shuttle landing.

We lost contact with STEREO-B (Solar and Terrestrial Relations Observatory) in October 2014. Read about our plan to get it back:  The two #STEREO #spacecraft  launched in October 2006  were originally designed to complete a two-year mission  ending in 2008. But—like many #NASA spacecraft—they lasted much longer. The long lives of the two STEREO spacecraft  now nine years old  have been a boon for scientists studying the sun and its influence throughout the solar system.   The two STEREOs slowly drifted away from Earth as they orbited the sun  one ahead and one behind our home planet  giving scientists constantly-improving views of the sun’s far side  allowing us for the first time to see the whole sun at once.

Macquarie’s Big History Institute offers a different perspective - featuring StarTalk friend and guest host David Grinspoon  A three-day conference at Macquarie University will thrash out #Earth’s latest existential crisis by looking at it from a variety of disciplinary angles — including quantum physics  economics and planetary science — and taking a big history perspective.  The gathering  staged by Macquarie’s Big History Institute  will consider the #Anthropocene — an increasingly popular term for the human-dominated geological epoch — and its struggles with climate change  health and population.  “We teach #history of the #universe ” says the institute’s director  David Christian. “You might think humans simply vanish on that scale. In one sense they do — we’re a recent species on an obscure planet around a very average #star.  “But this story helps you understand how the universe got more and more complex  and what (makes) us humans behave as no species has acted in four billion years. This is a very odd moment  and you cannot really appreciate how odd until you pan right back and place today’s world in this much larger context of a science-based universal history.”  US astrobiologist David Grinspoon  who addresses the conference on Friday  suspects #alien civilisations have faced similar moments. But we’ll never know unless they came out the other side.  If they didn’t  their signature in the cosmic record will have been too fleeting for us to notice. “If we become aware of their presence  they will have been doing this thing we’re attempting to do — living with planet-changing technology — much longer than we have ” he says.  Success will have made them virtually immortal  harnessing their technological capabilities to survive meteor strikes or control the climate to their advantage. “If (alien civilisations) achieved a mature relationship with technology  they should be out there.”  Christian says big history can help humans achieve the same goal  or survive climate change at any rate. “It’s very hard to get an overview of large complex problems that cut across disciplines ” he says.  “But all the big problems of the Anthropocene are exactly like that. You have to understand some economics  some chemistry  some geology to begin to get your brain around them. I don’t think you can understand it just within history or even just within ecology. You need to see how all these disciplines link together.”  Article from The Australian (Photo credit: John Ross) #astrobiology,LER,photo

Project StarGazer: Dec. 13 –14  1962  An early balloon-borne project to carry out astronomical studies at very high altitude. It involved only one flight. On Dec. 13–14  1962  Joseph Kittinger and William White  an #astronomer  flew a gondola suspended beneath an 85-meter-diameter Mylar #balloon to a height of 25 000 m over New Mexico. In addition to obtaining telescopic observations from above 95% of Earth's atmosphere  the flight provided valuable data for the development of pressure suits and associated life support systems during a 13-hour stay at the edge of space.  The balloon that supported the Stargazer capsule was a 280-foot diameter sphere of Mylar film; however  at launch only a comparatively small bubble of helium gas occupied the top of the balloon with the remainder of the balloon envelope dangling beneath. As the balloon rose  the gas expanded  filling the balloon until at maximum altitude  it was completely filled and reshaped the envelope into a sphere. The gondola was supported below the balloon on a cable giving a total height at takeoff of approximately 400 feet.  via The Worlds of David Darling  (Images attributed to: www.daviddarling.info and Jack Gruber/USA Today),LER,photo

Water World: Saturn's moon Enceladus and the rings. Although both Enceladus and the ring particles are made up largely of water ice  they are very different. The small ring particles are too tiny to retain internal heat and have no way to get warm  so they are frozen and geologically dead. Enceladus  on the other hand  is subject to forces that heat its interior to this very day. This results in its famous south polar water jets--which are just visible here above the moon’s dark  southern limb--along with a sub-surface ocean. Details: http://go.nasa.gov/1l2KDpF,HER,photo
Although they are made of mostly the same material  the relatively fresh surface of Saturn's active moon Enceladus (far) reflects more brightly than Dione's (near). Details: go.nasa.gov/1SU7tuC,HER,photo
The spacecraft has begun transmitting its latest images of Saturn's icy  geologically active moon Enceladus  acquired during the dramatic Oct. 28 flyby in which the probe passed about 30 miles (49 kilometers) above the moon's south polar region. The spacecraft will continue transmitting its data from the encounter for the next several days. "Cassini's stunning images are providing us a quick look at Enceladus from this ultra-close flyby  but some of the most exciting science is yet to come " said Linda Spilker  the mission's project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Here are some raw  unprocessed images. More to come: http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/newsreleases/newsrelease20151030/,HER,photo

High-phase observations -- taken looking generally toward the Sun  as in this image -- are very powerful scientifically since the way atmospheres and rings transmit sunlight is often diagnostic of compositions and physical states. Titan's crescent nearly encircles its disk due to the small haze particles high in its atmosphere refracting the incoming light of the distant Sun. Read more http://go.nasa.gov/1vCCWUB,HER,photo

Titan's building blocks might pre-date Saturn. Nitrogen in the atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan originated in conditions similar to the cold birthplace of the most ancient comets from the Oort cloud. The main implication of this new research is that Titan's building blocks formed early in the solar system's history  in the cold disk of gas and dust that formed the sun. The story: http://go.nasa.gov/1izXxsr,HER,photo
Notice the subtle variations in Titan's clouds?  These subtle features sometimes become more readily apparent when imaged at other wavelengths of light. This infrared image (using a filter which admits wavelengths of near-infrared light centered at 889 nanometers) clearly reveals a band around the Titan's north pole.

Here's a view toward the sunlit side of the rings revealing Atlas emerging from Saturn's shadow.   Wondering about the bright spot in the ring? Is it a jet or a clump?  We asked Cassini scientist Dr. Carl Murray  who replied "I would classify it as a "mini-jet" rather than an example of a "jet" that we sometimes see. They are both the product of collisions of small objects with the core of the F ring. These small objects orbit close to the core and occasionally collide with it. If the relative velocity is large enough then a larger "jet" is produced.  In this image the original "mini-jet" has sheared quite a bit -- if you look closely and change the contrast you can see a faint continuation of the "mini-jet" almost parallel to the core.  This much shear means that the collision probably happened a few days before the image was taken."  Thanks Dr. Carl Murray for the great answer!

Ten years ago today! Phoebe flyby! #Cassini10 Just weeks before Saturn Orbit Insertion  Cassini made its first targeted flyby -- of the moon Phoebe -- on June 11  2004. Cassini passed Phoebe  the largest of Saturn's outer or "irregular" moons  at an altitude of just 1 285 miles (2 068 kilometers). This was the only close flyby of one of the outer moons of Saturn in the entire Cassini mission.   The image on the left side shows Cassini's view on approach to Phoebe  while the right side shows the spacecraft's departing perspective.   Phoebe is thought to be a captured object that does not share a joint origin with Saturn and the inner  "regular" satellites. The prevailing view is that Phoebe might have formed in the Kuiper Belt  far beyond the orbit of Saturn. It might thus be a small cousin of the largest Kuiper Belt object  Pluto.

Happy birthday Giovanni Domenico Cassini  born on this day  June 8  1625 in the comune of Perinaldo in the Most Serene Republic of Genoa  now part of Italy.  Cassini discovered four moons of Saturn - Iapetus (1671)  Rhea (1672)  Tethys (1684)  and Dione (1684). In 1675  he discovered that Saturn's rings are separated into two parts by a gap  which is now called Cassini Division in his honor.  He also was the first director of the Paris Observatory  measured the sun's apparent motion through the sky  and even approximated the distance from the Earth to the Sun. In addition  he used the shadows of Jupiter's moons and shadows on Jupiter's surface to determine the length of Jupiter's day  and he is also credited with discovering Jupiter's Great Red Spot!,HER,photo

Another first! Another pale blue dot. Cassini's first-ever image of the pale blue ice-giant planet Uranus in the distance beyond Saturn's rings. (upper left of photo)  The robotic spacecraft briefly turned its gaze away from the ringed beauty of Saturn on April 11  2014  to observe the distant planet  which is the seventh planet from the sun.  This view was acquired by the Cassini narrow-angle camera at a distance of approximately 614 300 miles (988 600 kilometers) from Saturn on April 11  2014. Image scale at Uranus is approximately 16 000 miles (25 700 kilometers) per pixel. Image scale at Saturn's rings is approximately 4 miles (6 kilometers) per pixel. In the image  the disk of Uranus is just barely resolved. The solar phase angle at Uranus  seen from Cassini  is 11.9 degrees.  In addition to its aesthetic appeal  Cassini's view of Uranus also serves a practical purpose. Scientists working on several of Cassini's science investigations expect that they will be able to use images and spectra from these observations to help calibrate their own instruments.,HER,photo

Cassini has obtained some excellent new views of seas and lakes on Saturn's enigmatic moon  Titan.  News release: http://go.nasa.gov/1fVHodZ,HER,photo
CASSINI WEEKLY IMAGE: By the Pale Saturn-light  Enceladus's plume is only easily visible when Cassini and the Sun are on opposite sides of Enceladus. So what's lighting up the moon then?   It's light reflected off Saturn. This lighting trick allows the Cassini spacecraft to capture both the back-lit plume and the surface of Enceladus in one shot . . . http://go.nasa.gov/19tz1zE,HER,photo

CASSINI WEEKLY IMAGE: Arc Across the Heavens  The sunlit side of Saturn' rings from about 17 degrees above the ringplane.  http://go.nasa.gov/14yWjGV,HER,photo
Did you wave at Saturn and send us your photo? Then here's looking at you!   Read more: http://go.nasa.gov/19JxLgF,HER,photo
Since Saturn is tiled on its axis just like Earth is  it has seasons. But where seasons on Earth last three months  on Saturn they last about seven years. These majestic images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope show the rings as their inclination changed from 1996 to 2000. Each year until 2016  Saturn's rings will be increasingly apparent after appearing nearly edge-on in 2009.  Full picture: http://go.nasa.gov/16i6VHJ Hubble Heritage Project: http://go.nasa.gov/16i6Zaj,HER,photo
Tonight  Saturn will be between the moon and Venus again. Here is the view at 8.30 p.m. looking south west (this is the view from Los Angeles  positions change slightly depending you your location).,HER,photo
Check out Saturn tonight!  The ringed planet will be very easy to spot tonight. Around 8.30 p.m. Saturn will be on the right side of the moon.   (Graphic created with Stellarium.),HER,photo
BLOG: Dance of the Ice Crystals  Since July 19  when Cassini positioned itself in Saturn's shadow and began gathering data from this rare vantage point  ring scientists such as myself have been poring over the streams of data coming back. We're waiting – as you all are -- to see the full mosaic of the Saturn system stitched together by the imaging team  but in the mean time . . . http://go.nasa.gov/15LVzLP,HER,photo
CASSINI WEEKLY IMAGE: Stormy North. The weather forecast for Saturn's north pole: storms. Lots and lots of storms.  Saturn's north polar hexagon contains myriad storms of various sizes  not the least of which is the remarkable and imposing vortex situated over the planet's north pole . . .  http://go.nasa.gov/13ACxsk,HER,photo
Now that I'm done sending the 323 images for the Saturn mosaic back home  on Friday  July 26  I'll be focusing on Titan and its lakes. Monitoring the Titan lakes is important for tracking if and how they evolve over time and whether they change with the seasons. Are they evaporating and getting smaller  or staying the same  or getting larger?  Good questions. Stay tuned.  http://go.nasa.gov/132kB9x,HER,photo

CASSINI WEEKLY IMAGE: Two Moons Passing in the Night   Mimas and Pandora are drastically different. Although they are both moons of Saturn  Pandora's small size means that it lacks sufficient gravity to pull itself into a round shape like its larger sibling  Mimas. Researchers believe that the elongated shape of Pandora may hold clues to how it and other moons near the rings formed. More at . . . http://go.nasa.gov/11a4DZR,HER,photo

These are some raw images obtained simultaneously by the three detectors of the X-shooter instrument on the VLT. The light of a celestial object  in this case a quasar  is dispersed according to its wavelength or colour  to form a very long  very high resolution spectrum covering the full wavelength range from ultraviolet to infrared. The optical elements in the spectrograph arrange this long spectrum in a series of consecutive  shorter spectra  called orders. http://www.eso.org/public/images/xshooter_cc/ Image credit: ESO Astronomy,HER,photo
This raw image  straight from the OmegaCam instrument on the VST  was used together with many others to produce the iconic photo of the Carina Nebula. The images taken with astronomical instruments are always in intensity scale: the colour information is obtained by taking exposures through different glass filters.

ESO Flashback: Stellar nursery NGC 3603. Feel free to share!  NGC 3603 is a starburst region : a cosmic factory where stars form frantically from the nebula’s extended clouds of gas and dust. Located 22 000 light-years away from the Sun  it is the closest region of this kind known in our galaxy  providing astronomers with a local test bed for studying the intense star formation processes  very common in other galaxies  but hard to observe in detail because of their large distance.

ESO Flashback: Cosmic Bubble NGC 6781. Feel free to share!  The planetary nebula NGC 6781 lies a few thousand light-years away towards the constellation of Aquila (the Eagle) and is approximately two light-years across. Within NGC 6781  shells of gas blown off from the faint  but very hot  central star’s surface expand out into space. These shells shine under the harsh ultraviolet radiation from the progenitor star in intricate and beautiful patterns. The central star will steadily cool down and darken  eventually disappearing from view into cosmic oblivion.

Now You See It  Now You Don't  Now You Do Again  In the early morning hours  the arrival of the winter solstice was marked by a total lunar eclipse lasting three hours  28 minutes. Photographer Sean Smith recorded how it looked over NASA's Langley Research Center.  The last time a total lunar eclipse and the winter solstice coincided and was seen over this part of Virginia  the area was still being settled  nearby Jamestown was recovering from the starving time and the first buildings of Williamsburg were under construction.  It was Dec. 21  1638  The next time a similar occurrance can be seen over North America will be Dec. 21  2094.  A total lunar eclipse occurs when Earth aligns directly between the sun and moon  blocking the suns rays and casting a shadow over the moon. As it moves deeper into the Earth's shadow  the full moon changes color  from gray to orange or deep red. In this case  the moon was in complete shadow for 72 minutes.,HER,photo

Child of the 80s? If you're in your early thirties (or younger...)  tonight is likely the first time you will encounter a rare Super Blood Moon Total Lunar Eclipse since the last one occurred in 1982.   For this rare eclipse to happen  three separate lunar events need to converge: a total lunar eclipse  when the Earth gets between the moon and the sun; the full moon nearest the equinox (called harvest or blood moon);  the moon at its closest point to the Earth (super moon or perigee moon)  a mere 356 877 km away  which makes it appear about 14% bigger.    The partial eclipse begins at 9:07 pm EDT to end at 12:27 am while the total eclipse will start at 10:11 pm to end at 11:23 pm EDT.   Be sure to go out and look up at the sky tonight. The next time we’ll be treated with such a rare lunar event will be in...2033! And unlike a solar eclipse  the lunar eclipse is safe to watch with the naked eyes!  When and where to see the eclipse via Space.com: http://www.space.com/30607-supermoon-lunar-eclipse-time-place-guide.html  Cloudy where you are?

Happy birthday little rover! 3 years of Mars Curiosity and more to come!  Since it landed on Mars in 2012  the Curiosity Rover has been seeking to determine if the Red Planet ever had conditions to support life. Curiosity carries a Canadian-made geology instrument called Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS)  which enables the rover to determine the chemical composition of the rocks and soil on Mars.   It has contributed significantly to some of the mission's top science breakthroughs  including the discovery that ancient Mars could have had the right chemistry for microbial life.  It was announced last June that the Canadian Space Agency invested to support the operations of APXS and its science team for two more years  allowing for even more research and discoveries! Here’s too many more years of Curiosity!  Experience Curiosity with NASA’s new program  which simulates Mars in 3-D  based on real Curiosity data! http://eyes.nasa.gov/curiosity/  Announcement of APXS extension: http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=982439&tp=930,HER,photo

Venus and Jupiter Are Offering a Sky Show!  Throughout the month of June  we can admire a great astronomical spectacle  as the planets Venus and Jupiter are getting a little bit closer to one another each day.  The gap between the two planets continues to decrease  so much so that during the evening of June 20 (tomorrow)  the crescent Moon will also join in to form a beautiful triangle in the sky.  Venus and Jupiter will continue to converge until June 30  when they will only be 1/3rd of a degree apart. Although the phenomenon can be observed with the naked eye  a telescope or a pair of binoculars will help enjoy the full spectacle!   Don’t forget to add those dates to your calendar!

Shortest total lunar eclipse of the century to occur tomorrow morning   Early birds will have the chance to admire a total lunar eclipse Saturday morning for nearly five minutes – the shortest total eclipse in the century – as the Earth will come in between the sun and the moon  casting a shadow on the moon.    This eclipse will offer a beautiful spectacle as the moon will turn to a beautiful shade of red – hence its nickname “Blood Moon”.  This phenomenon is caused as the Earth's atmosphere refracts sunlight and indirectly lights up the Moon's surface.   The eclipse will start at 6:16 a.m. ET on Saturday  just as the moon sets on Eastern Canada. Western Canada  especially those of you in British Columbia  will be lucky enough to see the eclipse starting at 3:16 a.m. and peaking just before 5 a.m. PT – if you are willing to get out of bed this early!    Unlike solar eclipses  lunar eclipses are completely safe to watch so enjoy the show and send us your pictures!

Total solar eclipse in the wee hours of the night!  In a rare space event  the moon will be directly between the Earth and the Sun tomorrow morning  creating a solar eclipse.  Although a partial eclipse will be visible in some countries  including Europe  only the people in remote regions in the northern hemisphere will get to experience the full effect. For those in the Arctic  the sun will be completely obscured for 2 minutes 46.9 seconds.   In Canada  the solar eclipse will take place between 3:41 a.m. and 7:50 a.m. ET  making it impossible for most Canadians to see the moon completely covering the disk of the sun. However  if you live in Newfoundland  southeastern Baffin Island  northeastern Ellesmere Island or the eastern parts of Labrador (including Goose Bay and most coastal communities)  you can still try your luck at sunrise to see a glimpse of the partial eclipse.  Just a reminder to everyone in the eclipse zone:  be very careful and never look directly at the sun without proper equipment as it could cause permanent damage to your eyes! Safety first!   If you’re not in the eclipse zone  you can watch it via webcast thanks to Slooh: http://main.slooh.com/,HER,photo

Space storytime  folks! Gather 'round the fireside  milk and maple-cream cookies in hand. Here’s a classic tale of holiday magic  with our own twist. Happy holidays from the Canadian Space Agency!  'Twas just days before Christmas  when all through Mission Control  Not a flight lead was stirring  not even ROBO. The headsets were hung by the consoles with care   In hopes that a visiting vehicle soon would be there. The robots were nestled snug  their procedures all read;  While visions of lube oil danced in their artificially intelligent heads. And I  having poured a mug of rocket fuel  full to the brim   Had just settled in for a long night’s robotics sim   When over the voice loops there arose such a clatter   I sprang to my station to see what was the matter.  Away to the quad screen I flew like a flash   Turned on my PC and logged in real fast.  The Sun on the station’s glinting solar arrays   Gave a lustre of midday  holding darkness at bay   When what in the orbital distance did appear   But a gleaming white Dragon filled with holiday cheer   And little bold thrusters  firing so quick  so alive   I knew in a moment it must be SpaceX-5. More rapid than eagles  the payloads they came   I whistled  and shouted  and then I exclaimed:  "Now  Canadarm2! Now  robot! Power-up and alight   We’ll catch this Dragon and save today’s flight!” With precision surpassing a skilled surgeon’s knife   The Space Station’s big arm sprang into life;  Up to a grapple fixture  the robotic arm flew  With end effector ready  and Dextre watching too—  And then  in a twinkling  a sound came to my ears The crackling and readying of multiple gears.   As I adjusted my console  and was turning around   I saw a boom segment reach out with a bound.  Dressed in white thermals  from tip to hide   With the Canada wordmark emblazoned on its side;  In the blink of an eye—a twist of its joints  And I knew in that moment I could do nothing but gawk and point. The arm reached out  and went straight to its work   Grappling that Dragon with nary a jerk   Taking care not to snag anything  not even a hose   Upon my nod  up onto the Harmony module  the Dragon rose.  The arm lowered itself back down onto its perch  emitting a low metallic whistle   And settled in quietly  without my dismissal.  But I heard a robotic voice call out  well out of sight—  “Happy Christmas to all  and to all a good flight!”,HER,photo

Wish upon a star tonight and tomorrow!  It's the time of the year for the most famous meteor shower - the Leonids! At its peak  you can expect to see 10-15 shooting stars per hour...clear skies permitting!   The Leonid meteor shower occurs around this date every year and radiates from the constellation Leo with a meteor visible every few minutes. Comet Temple-Tuttle produces the debris for the Leonids and leaves a fresh trail of dust particles with each passage near the Earth  creating a brilliant display of thousands of meteors.

The Canadian Space Agency had the pleasure of welcoming a very special guest at lunchtime today! William Gadoury  a 14-year old student from Académie Antoine Manseau in Joliette  won first prize at Quebec’s provincial Expo Sciences finales. He presented his project at the IGARSS Conference in Quebec City last July. Further to this event  the CSA invited him to share his discoveries with our employees.   “I discovered that the Mayan and other ancient civilizations have built their main cities according to the positions of stars in the constellations. Based on my calculations  the correlation between the positions of the stars and those of the cities is 95% accurate.”   The Canadian Space Agency has provided William with RADARSAT-2 imagery to help him find a lost city. Congratulations to this young scientist! For more information on the project (page partly in French): http://exposciences.qc.ca/en/awards-winners/winner/record/5087/ne-du-ciel,HER,photo
Time flies!  Canadarm  Canada's most famous robotic and technological achievement  made its space debut on the Space Shuttle Columbia (STS-2) on November 13  1981. The design and building of the arm marked the beginning of Canada's close collaboration with NASA in human space flight by allowing the creation of Canada’s Astronaut Corps–a sterling example of successful international cooperation in space.  After 90 missions and nearly 30 years of faithful service in space  the arm completed its operations on July 21  2011  along with the Space Shuttle program.   A retired Canadarm is now on display and can be admired at the Canada Aviation and Space Museum in Ottawa  our nation’s capital (2nd photo)!

The Perseids are Back! Wish upon a star... dozens of times a night! Heading out to cottage country or camping? Be sure to look for the Perseids  one of the most impressive annual meteor showers! Each year  from late July to mid-August  hundreds of meteors rain down on our skies as the Earth passes through the tail of Comet Swift-Tuttle. An increasing number of shooting stars should be visible every night  until the light show culminates August 12-13. During the peak  typically in the darkest hours after midnight  up to 50 to 80 meteors per hour can streak across the sky.  Here are a few tips for meteor hunting: •If possible  head away from city lights  which make it hard to see fainter meteors. To increase your chances of seeing shooting stars  set out in search of dark skies in the countryside.  • Dress warmly. Even though the Perseids occur in the summertime  it is still a good idea to bring warm (even winter) clothes. August nights can be very chilly. • Sit back and relax on a reclining chair or lie down on a blanket. Not only is it much more comfortable to observe the stars lying down  but you'll also see more that way. • Pack a thermos of hot chocolate or coffee—it will come in handy if you start to drift off or get a little chilly!  • If you need to use a flashlight  place a red filter over the bulb (a red balloon will do in a bind). White light is very blinding and may affect your night vision. • Be patient. It might take a while before you see your first shooting star. Don't be quick to give up... It's worth the wait!  And don't forget to make a wish! Photo: Perseids below! Astronaut Ron Garan snapped this shot of a Perseid meteor (the white streak) below the International Space Station (ISS) on August 13  2011.

How do we drive Dextre and fly Canadarm2?  Justin Cuplinkas asked us for details on how Canadarm2 and Dextre are operated. Here's the answer from Ed Birchnall  flight controller at the CSA and part of the team that trains flight controllers and astronauts in robotics:   Canadarm2 and Dextre were designed to be operated the same way and there are several different options available. There are two joysticks (or hand-controllers as we call them) at the robotics workstation on the International Space Station. If an astronaut were to fly one of the arms in what we call manual mode  they would use both hand controllers to drive the Canadarm2. The translational hand controller can move the tip (or another point we decide on) up  down  left  right  in and out. The rotational hand-controller can make the robotic arm rotate in pitch  yaw and roll. This is how the astronauts drive Canadarm2 to capture a visiting vehicle like the SpaceX Dragon that is docked right now  or to move an astronaut around on the end of Candarm2 during a spacewalk.  The hand-controllers can also be used to drive the arm one joint at a time or to swing the "elbow" of the arm. Imagine holding on to a door knob and without moving your hand  rotating your elbow.   We can also drive the arms without hand controllers  which is the way it is controlled by the ground at Johnson Space Center and here at the CSA by the mission control team.  We call these "automatic sequences."  We can pick a set of coordinates around the space station where we want the tip of the arm to be and tell it to go there. We can also tell all seven joints which position to go to and they will all drive at the same time to get to their final positions at the same time.  This is our most common way of operating which allows us to do some of the really complex motions of Candarm2 and Dextre.    The same hand-controllers can be used to operate both Canadarm2 and Dextre but they can only drive one arm at a time. Today  the hand...,HER,photo

Today on the International Space Station  Dextre became the first space robot to repair its own system when he removed a faulty camera located on Canadarm2's elbow and relocated it to the mobile base (together  Dextre  Canadarm2 and the mobile base form the Mobile Servicing System  Canada's robotic contribution to the space station).  It took two tries to remove the camera from its mounting on Canadarm2  likely because cold metal tends to be a bit sticky. But Dextre got it out on the third try with a bit of jiggling...and some elbow grease!  The first of two cameras that Dextre will replace in the coming days  this camera produced hazy images--like looking through a foggy window. While it may not be clear enough to help guide Canadarm2's movements  it will be sufficient for providing images from its new location on the mobile base. At the end of the day  Canadarm2 moved Dextre into a park position for the next operations on Tuesday  when Dextre will retrieve a second camera from the Japanese module’s airlock—the first time this has ever been attempted--and place it on the empty slot on Canadarm2's elbow.

Did you find the answer to the question in our previous post? No? Well this "rod" is actually one of eight 1-meter long superbolts that secured the folded Canadarm2 in its launch cradle (the Spacelab Pallet  seen in the photo). CSA astronaut Chris Hadfield and NASA's Scott Parazynski removed the eight bolts before unfolding the arm and installing it on the space station in April 2001. One of these bolts is now on display at our headquarters.    The same pallet was used in 2008 to launch Canada's robotic handyman Dextre.,HER,photo

NASA Astronauts Steve Swanson and Rick Mastracchio (wearing the suit with the red stripes) successfully completed a 1.5 hour spacewalk to replace a failed back up computer (MDM) this morning. The MDM is one of two computers that provide telemetry and command for various external systems  including the Mobile Transporter that carries Dextre and Canadarm2.   CSA Astronaut Jeremy Hansen did a great job as Ground IV  guiding the spacewalkers through procedures from NASA's Mission Control Center in Houston  Texas. It was the first time that a Canadian played this important role from the ground. Jeremy can be seen top left on the second picture.  An all-Canadian robotics team (ROBO) was also on console at CSA to configure Dextre's cameras to watch part of the spacewalk.   The spacewalk went quickly and smoothly and Swanson was even able to perform a get-ahead task by cutting a dangling lanyard that prevented Dextre from finishing a demo task last June. This 179th spacewalk in support of the assembly and maintenance of the ISS was Mastracchio's 9th spacewalk and Swanson's 5th.

A Canadian First! CSA Astronaut Jeremy Hansen will have a front row seat during next week’s contingency spacewalk to replace a failed backup computer on the International Space Station (ISS). Sitting by the Capcom at NASA’s Mission Control Center  he will be acting as Ground IV  or Intravehicular crewmember  supporting NASA’s Rick Mastracchio and Steve Swanson and helping them with procedures during the spacewalk.   While Marc Garneau  Julie Payette and Chris Hadfield have acted as IV in the past from inside the ISS  it will be the first time a Canadian astronaut is trusted with the role of “spacewalk choreographer” from the ground.  The 2 5-hour spacewalk is set for Wednesday  April 23  unless SpaceX scrubs its launch attempt today  in which case the excursion will move up earlier to Easter Sunday  April 20. In preparation for the spacewalk  Jeremy took part in countless team meetings this week to plan  develop procedures and anticipate everything that could go wrong. In this picture from April 16  he uses a spacesuit simulator to practice emergencies.  Read more about the spacewalk: http://ow.ly/vUEGO,HER,photo

Today is #WorldCancerDay.  Space is a hazardous environment to live and work in  especially when it comes to radiation. Originating from violent storms on the Sun and galactic cosmic rays  this natural radiation can pose a serious health risk for astronauts on long-duration space missions like those on the International Space Station where radiation levels are hundreds of times higher than the levels on Earth.  The CSA's support of radiation research will not only lead to major advancements for future human exploration of space  but also in our knowledge of the health risks of radiation  such as cancer  neurological damage and degenerative tissue disease. Radi-N2 and its predecessor Radi-N  as well as EVARM are examples of Canadian science experiments on space radiation:  Radi-N2  performed by Chris Hadfield (as seen on the photo): http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/sciences/radi-n2.asp  EVARM: http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/iss/evarm.asp,HER,photo

The Perseids are Back! Wish upon a star…dozens of times a night! Heading out to cottage country or camping?  Be sure to look for the Perseids  one of the most impressive annual meteor showers! Each year  from late July to mid-August  hundreds of meteors rain down on our skies as the Earth passes through the tail of Comet Swift-Tuttle. An increasing number of shooting stars should be visible every night  until the light show culminates on the nights of August 11-13. During the peak  typically in the darkest hours after midnight  up to 50 to 80 meteors per hour can streak across the sky.  Here are a few tips for meteor hunting: - If possible  head away from city lights  which make it hard to see fainter meteors. To increase your chances of seeing shooting stars  set out in search of dark skies in the countryside.  - Dress warmly. Even though the Perseids occur in the summertime  it is still a good idea to bring warm (even winter) clothes. August nights can be very chilly. - Sit back and relax on a reclining chair or lie down on a blanket. Not only is it much more comfortable to observe the stars lying down  but you’ll also see more that way. - Pack a thermos of hot chocolate or coffee—it will come in handy if you start to drift off or get a little chilly!  - If you need to use a flashlight  place a red filter over the bulb (a red balloon will do in a bind). White light is very blinding and may affect your night vision. - Be patient. It might take a while before you see your first shooting star. Don’t be quick to give up... It’s worth the wait.  And don’t forget to make a wish! Photo: Perseids below! Astronaut Ron Garan snapped this shot of a Perseid meteor (the white streak) below the International Space Station on August 13  2011.

How Chris Hadfield Exercises Back to Health by Natalie Hirsch  Canadian Space Agency Exercise Specialist  Most of the muscles that control posture on earth go on vacation for the duration of a space mission  except during 2 hours of in-flight exercise per day  and upon return to earth need to work every waking minute to support the body.  These conditions leave astronauts feeling fatigued  stiff  sore and unstable upon return to earth. (Consider that astronauts do not sit down while in space so even their tailbones hurt while they get used to sitting again on Earth.)   Fortunately  our bodies are amazing machines that continually adapt to our surroundings and the discomfort experienced upon return to earth is temporary and part of the normal response of a healthy human body getting used to a significantly different environment.  The time to adapt to a new environment varies between astronauts: genetics  fitness  age  duration in space  exercise in space and upon return to earth can all play a role in how long it takes to return to being a healthy & fit earthling.  The overall goal of the post-flight reconditioning program is to assist an astronaut in returning to his pre-flight physical fitness - ensuring that he (or she) is just as sprightly after a stint in microgravity as he was before launch. This includes making sure his balance  agility  muscular endurance  strength and power  flexibility  cardiovascular fitness and bone density are similar to when he left earth.  Reconditioning:  Week 1 The first week of reconditioning included a movement assessment to identify how the returning astronaut performs basic movements (balancing  stepping  squatting  and lunging) and exercises to practice these movements.   The focus of the first few days of reconditioning was on balance  coordination and locomotion - getting used to controlling body in gravity - and cardiovascular fitness.    More on why and how astronauts exercise in space: http://ow.ly/lbB2r,HER,photo
Fourth update on Chris Hadfield’s condition   by Raffi Kuyumjian  CSA’s Chief Medical Officer and Hadfield’s Flight Surgeon  The weekend schedule will allow Chris some "active rest". His walk continues to improve despite some lingering dizziness and soreness in his back muscles  which are slowly getting used to working again in keeping the back straight and upright against gravity after 5 months of complete rest... Somewhat similar to having spent 24/7 in bed without moving for 5 months and then suddenly having to get up and walk!  Today a session of science data collection on Manual Control testing for coordination and reaction times using a motion flight simulator and car simulator amongst others: showing clear signs of improvement compared to 3 days ago when he completed the same tests! After the usual 2-hour daily reconditioning session  a few interview sessions will complete the day for Chris.    Photo: Manual Control testing using a Motion Flight Simulator. May 18  2013.

Choice quotes from Col. Chris Hadfield during his news conference (paraphrased):  "On the ISS  when you have 30 seconds free  you go do something else!"  "It's a whole new normal  my body was perfectly happy living in space... My body is catching up with the change."  "We're learning about the fundamental nature of matter because the ISS exists."  "People followed me because there is poetry and purpose in what is happening on the ISS."  "I'm not a person who looks back and wishes that my past was my present."  "In the gym yesterday  it felt like someone was squeezing me down into the floor  felt like it was so unfair!"  "Zero gravity is like a superpower!"  "We are working hard to make the most out of the taxpayer's dollar and make the ISS a fabric of the lives of Canadians."   "I don't have a callouses on the bottom of my feet yet  I'm walking around like an infant."  "CSA's Microflow tested to show how space tech can help remote communities with things like blood testing."  "We're also inspiring our youth to do something that barely seems possible."  On his landing: "We could smell spring  the charred spacecraft  growing grass wafting through the open door."  "In 2001  ISS was barely functional  only 1 lab  it was just getting going. The reason we put Canadarm2 on was to build ISS."  "The number of people following is a measure of the number of people who shared the experience."  "My advice: turn yourself into what you want to become step by step as a demonstration of personal will."  On his favourite photo he took in space: "Most proud of the pic of the Sun over Indian ocean  noctilucent clouds  revealing how our upper atmosphere works.",HER,status

Secrets of the Starry Summer Night - What to see this August   • The Perseid Meteor Showers: Each year  the Earth passes through the tail of Comet Swift-Tuttle  causing shooting stars as tiny particles streak through Earth’s atmosphere. This year  the peak is expected on the night of August 12  with dozens of meteors expected each hour. Look to the northeast after midnight  and keep your list of wishes on hand.  • The International Space Station: The second brightest object in the night sky after the full Moon  the Station can be seen with the naked eye. It looks much like an aircraft  minus the blinking lights. To see the Station  visit http://heavens-above.com and enter the name of your hometown. When you see the Station glide by overhead  think of the Canada wordmark waving proudly on Canadarm2 and Dextre  the Canadian Space Agency robots hard at work on board. Canadian astronaut Col. Chris Hadfield will join them when he blasts off to the Station in December 2012 for a six-month mission that will make him the first Canadian Commander of the orbiting science lab.  • The Northern Lights: The aurora borealis are frequent in Canada’s North  but they can also be seen in southern parts of the country during periods of intense solar activity.

RRM: Dextre’s Duty Log for Day 3  Dextre capped off three days of success for the Robotic Refueling Mission (RRM) on June 21  2012. Using the Multifunction Tool built by NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center  Dextre used an adapter to perform a series of intricate ops beneath the RRM ambient cap  including using a plunger inside the tool to simulate breaking the seal on a fuel tank—an essential step in refueling a real satellite (the fuel tank on most satellites is sealed up prior to launch  since they are usually not designed to be repaired). One of the goals of RRM is to demonstrate how robots could perform the tasks necessary for refueling and servicing a satellite in space.   After completing work on the plug and ambient cap  Dextre then picked up another adapter for the Multifunction Tool (similar to a multi-bit screwdriver—Dextre switched adapters throughout the three days much like a handyman changes the tips for a screwdriver). Dextre succeeded in fitting the adapter on a tertiary cap on the RRM module  a task which required minute precision  and which is even difficult for human hands. Afterwards  Dextre stowed the multifunction tool and its adapter in the RRM tool bay and conducted some tests on a nozzle tool that will be used during the next phase of RRM  when Dextre will simulate refueling the RRM mock satellite.

Ask Team Juno: Magnetosphere   Have any questions for our science team on Jupiter’s powerful magnetosphere or the instruments on Juno that will explore it?   1. Post them in the comments below.  2. The most “liked" question posted by 3pm EST on Wednesday receives a personalized video response from one of the Juno scientists!* 3. The other questions will be answered as well  but in the comment thread.   For more on Jupiter’s magnetosphere and the Juno instruments designed to study it: http://1.usa.gov/1tl2pWQ  A Quick Take: One of Juno’s science objectives is to explore and characterize Jupiter’s magnetosphere. Juno will directly sample the charged particles and magnetic fields near Jupiter's poles for the first time  while simultaneously observing the auroras in ultraviolet and infrared light produced by the extraordinary amounts of energy crashing into the polar regions. These investigations will greatly improve our understanding of this remarkable phenomenon  and also of similar magnetic objects  like young stars with their own planetary systems.  *inappropriate or off-topic questions will not be considered.,HER,photo

And Juno heard it.   http://youtu.be/hg9xY1zvrsw  For more of the Earth Flyby and the "Hi Juno" ham radio experiment  visit http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2013-360  #OTD #HIJuno,HER,video

It's official: on February 11  10:30 EST  there will be a big press conference about gravitational waves by the people running the gravitational wave detector LIGO. It's a fair bet that they will announce the first direct detection of gravitational waves  predicted by Albert Einstein 100 years ago. If all goes as the scientists hope  this will be the kick-off for an era of gravitational wave astronomy: for learning about some of the most extreme and violent events in the cosmos by measuring the tiny ripples of space distortions that emanate from them.

On this day: 8 November 1656  Edmond Halley was born in Shoreditch  London. Halley was the English astronomer and mathematician who is best known for recognising that a bright comet (later named after him) had appeared several times  calculating its orbit (1682) and for successfully predicting its return. After originating the question that prodded Isaac Newton to write his Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica  Halley edited it and arranged its publication. Halley identified the proper motion of stars  studied the Moon's motion and tides  realised that nebulae were clouds of luminous gas among the stars  and that the aurora was a phenomenon connected with Earth's magnetism. His prediction of the transit of Venus led to Cook's voyage to Tahiti. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond_Halley,HER,photo

On this day: 3 July 1980  ESA decides to upgrade the Ariane 1 launcher.   By 1980  customer requirements had changed since the early 1970s  when the initial specifications of Ariane 1 were drafted. Satellite payloads were becoming larger and heavier  and Ariane 1 was unable to serve a growing share of the launching market. Earlier in 1976  CNES had made proposals to ESA for improved performance of the launcher  and these changes led to Ariane 2. Another version its first stage fitted with two solid-propellant strap-on boosters for additional thrust during ascent  this version being designated Ariane 3. Furthermore  ESA had developed a system for deployment of multiple payloads. The first upgraded rocket  an Ariane 3  was launched on 4 August 1984.

On this day: 16 June 1657  the first pendulum clock was patented by its inventor  Dutch physicist  mathematician and astronomer Christiaan Huygens. Although others had worked in this field before him  Huygens made major advances in building a practical clock (Galileo had the idea for a pendulum clock in 1637  which was partly constructed by his son in 1649  but neither lived to finish it). Huygens was inspired by investigations of pendulums by Galileo. He needed time accuracy for his astronomical measurements. This technology revolutionised timekeeping  reducing the loss of time by clocks from about 15 minutes to about 15 seconds per day (pendulum clocks remained the world standard for accurate timekeeping for 270 years  until the invention of the quartz clock in 1927). Huygens contracted the construction of his clock designs to clockmaker Salomon Coster  who actually built the clock. This clock can be seen in the Boerhaave Museum  Leiden  the Netherlands.,HER,photo

On this day: 27 December 1571  Johannes Kepler was born  in Weil der Stadt  near Stuttgart  in Germany. Kepler was a mathematician  astronomer and astrologer. A key figure in the 17th century scientific revolution  he is best known for his laws of planetary motion  which also provided one of the foundations for Isaac Newton's theory of universal gravitation (he is also known as an assistant to astronomer Tycho Brahe). ESA's second Automatic Transfer Vehicle (ATV) launched to resupply the ISS in 2011   and NASA's 2009 Kepler mission  as well as craters on the Moon and Mars  and an asteroid  are named after him.,HER,photo
On this day: 25 December 1642  Isaac Newton was born  at Woolsthorpe Manor in Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth  a hamlet in the English county of Lincolnshire. Sir Isaac Newton was a physicist and mathematician who is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of all time. His book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica  first published in 1687  laid the foundations for most of classical mechanics. Newton also made contributions to optics and shares credit with Leibniz for inventing calculus.,HER,photo

On this day: 23 December 1672  the Italian/French mathematician and astronomer Giovanni Cassini discovered Saturn's moon Rhea  the fifth major satellite of Saturn  which is one of the most heavily cratered satellites in the Solar System. Cassini is best known as the discoverer of four satellites of Saturn  and he noted the division of the rings of Saturn (named after him). He shares credit with British astronomer Robert Hooke for the discovery of the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. Cassini was also the first to observe differential rotation within Jupiter's atmosphere.,HER,photo
