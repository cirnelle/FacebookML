Swaziland is one of the five countries with the highest HIV rates in the world. The current national adult prevalence rate of HIV infection is 33%  and the HIV prevalence rate among pregnant women rose from 4% in 1992  to 43% in 2004.  Despite these extreme circumstances  Swaziland’s Global Fund-financed HIV/AIDS program has achieved impressive results since its inception in August 2003.  In Swaziland  (RED) money is supporting Global Fund-financed programs  which have already:      * reached over 4 400 mothers with services to prevent mother-to-child-transmission of HIV     * trained over 150 midwives and doctors in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV     * equipped over 40 hospitals to provide services to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV     * reached over 140 000 people with voluntary counseling and testing for prevention of HIV     * trained over 70 counselors to teach prevention of HIV     * set up over 35 counseling and testing centers for prevention of HIV     * established feeding schemes in 335 schools     * built 154 community feeding centers     * provided education support for over 36 000 vulnerable children     * provided anti-retroviral therapy for HIV/AIDS to almost 15 000 patients     * trained over 3 000 health workers to deliver home-based care for patients with HIV/AIDS  In the next two to three years  these programs aim to increase four-fold the number of women receiving treatment to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV  to offer comprehensive support for orphans and to more than double the number of people currently on antiretroviral therapy.  See how (RED) money is helping The Global Fund fight the pandemic.,LER,video
Ghana has more than 320 000 people living with HIV including 180 000 women and 25 000 are children under the age of 15. There are an estimated 170 000 children who have lost one or both parents to AIDS.  Ghana's results: (RED) money that flows to Ghana supports Global Fund financed programs which have already:      * Enabled 371 000 people to complete HIV testing and counseling process.     * Trained 9991 HIV testing counselor and 879 prevention of mother-to-child counselors.     * Enabled testing and counseling of over 109 000 pregnant women.     * Established and supported 407 centers to reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.     * Provided preventative antiretroviral treatment to over 3 250 HIV-positive pregnant women to reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.     * Provided antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) to over 11 500 people.     * Prepared 80 laboratories with the capacity to monitor ART.     * Trained 383 service deliveries in clinical management if of people living with HIV.     * Reached over 1 900 HIV positive patients with home based care.,LER,video

The Wounded Warrior Project family is deeply saddened by the sudden passing of J. T. Townsend.  J.T. lit up a room with his positive energy and outlook on life. Through the J.T. Townsend Foundation he inspired and touched the lives of thousands.  J.T. saw his own spinal cord injury and paralysis as an opportunity to help others  and never wavered in his determination to improve the lives of individuals living with disabilities. J.T was selfless  always giving and using his personal story for good in the community.   We are grateful for the time we had with J.T. as he completed his studies at University of North Florida with an internship in our Jacksonville  FL office.    J.T’s smile and laugh inspired us and we know his beautiful spirit will continue to make a difference in the lives of many more.   Our thoughts and prayers go out to J.T.’s family and friends.   We invite you to join us in honoring J.T.'s memory and life of service with a gift to his foundation to assist the individuals he worked so tirelessly to serve: http://www.jttownsendfoundation.org/donate/,LER,link

"So many families can't get through this process of recovery and end up breaking up  but this kind of special touch helps us to remember what's really important."

Reason #4 to give today: You can help men  women  and children rebuild their lives after they’ve courageously escaped from the LRA.

Reason #3 to give today: Helping LRA abductees escape is only part of the equation. It’s also vital that we educate & train our community partners in DRC and CAR on how to safely receive and support the men  women  and children who are returning home.,LER,link
Reason #2 to give today: We are empowering communities and peacefully dismantling the LRA from within by working with local journalists in DRC and CAR to create & broadcast “Come Home” radio messages. These messages have been proven to give Kony’s fighters the courage and instructions they need to safely escape the LRA.  You can fund these lifesaving messages by donating to our #GivingTuesday fundraising campaign. All donations made today will be matched by a generous donor and have DOUBLE the impact.  https://give.invisiblechildren.com/events/givingtuesday-2015/e64297,LER,link
Reason #1 to give today: On a recent trip to central Africa  Ananda met this 4 year old elephant named Charles. He was orphaned at a very young age when both of his parents were killed by poachers.

From Ananda: I woke up early yesterday morning to watch Joannick  our Early Warning Network Hub Operator in Central African Republic (CAR)  conduct the first of two daily security check-ins with communities across CAR.   The reality that this Network is a lifeline for hundreds of thousands of people targeted by LRA violence hit me like a slap in the face. I listened anxiously as each community  one by one  either reported that all was well  or that there had been an LRA sighting or attack in their area since the previous day's check in. For most of these communities  the Early Warning Network is their only way of letting neighboring towns and the outside world know if they've been attacked.,LER,video

A message from our President and CEO  Lisa Dougan  on the five-year anniversary of the passing of our beloved friend and colleague  Nate Henn:  "Five years ago today  the world lost a true hero  a gentle giant  and a deeply loved son  brother  and friend. On behalf of Invisible Children  and with a heavy heart  I celebrate the life of Nate Henn  a fallen peacemaker and a beloved member of the Invisible Children family who was tragically killed in the 2010 World Cup bombings in Kampala  Uganda.  Our love  our gratitude for Nate  and our wishes for peace and comfort go out to the Henn Family. While being honest in their grief  the Henn Family has continued to be such an incredible example of courage  resilience  and grace to all of us. Their embodiment of Nate's legacy and their steadfast commitment to the mission of Invisible Children continues to inspire and astound us.  I vividly remember the last personal communication I had with Nate before his life was tragically taken. On the evening of May 24  2010  I received the most joyful  exuberant text message from Nate. It came just hours after I had the privilege of representing Invisible Children  along with Ben and Jason  at the White House when President Obama signed the LRA Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act into law. Nate was beyond ecstatic about the historic victory -- one that he had worked so hard for  along with hundreds of thousands of other young Americans  and dozens of Uganda friends who had joined him as Invisible Children roadies in 2010.  There is no way to adequately express Nate's commitment to peace for LRA-affected communities  and his love for his friends in northern Uganda. While my heart aches on days like today  I'm also deeply and inexplicably thankful for the gift of knowing Nate and his friendship  and that my last exchange with Nate took place on such a special day that embodied the work of peace that he wholeheartedly gave himself to.  Today  I am reminded and challenged to be conduit of Nate's life and legacy -- to remain committed to the work of peace  to bridging cultural and geographic divides through friendship  and to living joyfully and with laughter as Nate did every single day.  I am actually writing this from central Africa where I will be spending the next few weeks with Invisible Children's teams and community partners in DRC and CAR. I could not think of anything more inspiring or motivating to continue the work of seeing an end to LRA violence than the combination of Nate's life of love  paired with the courage  resilience  and dedication of our staff and community partners in central Africa.  I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that Nate would stop at nothing to see peace in central Africa  and communities free from violence. I hope I can live with even a fraction of Nate's courage  love  and determination to see this mission through to the end....and to have fun while doing it.  I love you  Nate.  I love you  Henn Family.  I love you  Invisible Children Community.  Blessed are the peacemakers.",LER,status

“Spike your best friend’s eggnog when they’re not looking.”  Bloomingdale's ran this inappropriate ad that suggests date rape in their holiday catalog  clearly showing the man looking at the woman as she's turned away distracted.

Reworking an ad to point out its sexist nature can help counteract the messages advertisers are trying to convey.

Anybody can like superheroes  they’re being stupid aren’t they?”  The store has since apologized saying: “This alarm clock would make a great gift for both girls and boys. The sign has been removed and we’re sorry if it caused any confusion.”  Best line from the BuzzFeed article is this one: "Fortunately it doesn’t seem to have put her off - as well as superheroes she loves Doctor Who  Minecraft  dragons  skeletons and zombies (she had a cemetery cake for her birthday!) but also likes Frozen  princesses  kittens etc. She just thinks shops labelliing toys for boys or girls is silly: “I can like what I want.”  You're awesome Maggie!,HER,photo

Watch: LIFE IS SACRED at the Human Rights Watch Film Festival!   Do you know the story of Antanas Mockus? See the inspiring doc about his life  June 18th & 20th IFC Center & Film Society of Lincoln Center http://bit.ly/1JwQ60d  Violence is part of everyday life in #Colombia  where the military  guerrillas  paramilitaries  and drug cartels have been fighting for decades  and hundreds of thousands of people have been killed. But the unorthodox presidential candidate Antanas Mockus and his enthusiastic young activist supporters attempt to reverse the vicious cycle with an imaginative and positive election campaign. As mayor of Bogotá  dressed in a Superman costume and with an indomitable trust in the good of his fellow citizens  he took on towering crime rates and people's bad traffic habits. Can good ideas and an idealistic drive alone change a political culture where violence is rampant? This is the portrait of an inspiring man and a powerful youth movement  whose stories are relevant far beyond Colombia's borders.,LER,video

Tune in! The creators of THE TRIALS OF SPRING  an incredible project which will be shown as both a feature documentary and a multimedia presentation this week at HRWFF - New York  will be interviewed live on HuffPost Live today at 3:30PM EST!  Director. Gini Reticker and exec. producer Abigail Disney will be interviewed by Alyona Minkovski: http://live.huffingtonpost.com/  Women were on the front lines of the uprisings that swept the Arab world in 2011. Young and old  rich and poor  veiled and unveiled  they took to the streets beside men  their signs held high or hands cupped around their mouths to amplify their voices. But as the jubilation of revolution gave way to the convoluted process of governing—and often the chaos and blood of war—women disappeared from the mainstream story. Behind the scenes  however  they continue to play vital roles—keeping schools open and mouths fed  tending to the sick and injured  keeping the world informed through blogs and social media  lobbying for human rights  running for office  building alliances  even drafting constitutions for fledgling democracies. The Trials of Spring is a multimedia initiative that aims to elevate the stories of these women.,LER,photo

În cazul în care nu va exista o anchetă penală  pot fi cel puţin adoptate politici care să facă reapariţia torturii mai puţin probabilă. CIA  cu tradiţia sa de secretomanie şi lipsa asumării publice  ar trebui să nu mai reţină suspecţi  lăsând astfel de treburi în seama Departamentului de Justiţie. Când suspecţii sunt reţinuţi pentru interogare  Comitetul Internaţional al Crucii Roşii ar trebui să aibă acces imediat şi regulat  fără nicio excepţie. Cu tradiţia sa de confidenţialitate  acesta nu ar pune în pericol investigaţii delicate  în timp ce prezenţa sa ar descuraja orice tentativă de tortură. Iar când tortura reapare  ar trebui să se asigure protecţia pentru cei care o raportează  iar victimele ar trebui să fie lăsate să dea în judecată pentru despăgubiri la Curtea din SUA.,LER,link

THANK YOU to more than 38 000 people from 127 countries and territories who raised their voices by signing a petition to save the vaquita  the world’s smallest porpoise. Last week  the Mexican government announced it would begin phasing out deadly drift gillnets and substituting with more selective and vaquita-friendly gear!  Found only in a small area of the upper Gulf of California  Mexico  there are estimated to be fewer than 200 vaquitas left. Since this little porpoise often becomes entangled in fishing gillnets and drowns  the recent announcement is a major step in vaquita conservation.

Elephants live in a matriarchal society  so other females in the social group help a calf to its feet after birth and show the baby how to nurse. The older elephants adjust the pace of the herd so the calf can keep stride. By watching the adults  the calf learns which plants to eat and how to access them. The females regularly make affectionate contact with the calf.  Send your Mom this image as an e-card: http://wwf.to/12gg3cC,HER,photo

The Problem: Pirate fishing  which is illegal  unreported and unregulated  is a big driver of the overfishing crisis. Pirate fishing remains invisible since what happens out on the water is often left unmonitored. And once fish products leave the boat  they can be difficult to track through the supply chain.  The Solution: WWF has found an inexpensive and effective way to retrace the routes and activities of fishing vessels—using existing satellite data. See how it works: http://wwf.to/13mwEgS,HER,photo
More sad wildlife crime news: Poaching statistics released by the South African government reveal 668 rhinos were slaughtered in 2012—a record high and a 50% increase over 2011.

The horn is also seen as a highly desirable status symbol in some Asian countries  notably Vietnam. This has enticed well-organized  well-financed and highly-mobile criminal groups to become involved in rhino poaching.  Take a stand with WWF: http://wwf.to/Zy8njb,HER,photo

Dekila Chungyalpa  director of WWF's Sacred Earth program  argues that the killing of elephants  rhinos and Asian tigers is a moral issue and that new strategies--such as religion--can help get the anti-poaching message across.  "Faith leaders are the heart and backbone of local communities.

Did you know that despite their fearsome reputation as ruthless predators  sharks are much more likely to be killed by humans than the other way around? Some species  such as this porbeagle  are targeted primarily for their meat. However the growing trade in shark fins - often used to make an expensive Asian soup - has become a serious threat to many shark species. Sharks are caught  the fins are cut off and the rest of the shark is thrown back into the sea. As many as an estimated 73 million sharks are killed every year  primarily for their fins.    Despite living in cold waters  the porbeagle is a very fast swimmer  closely related to great white sharks. They have the ability to thermoregulate and therefore raise their body temperatures higher than the surrounding water.,HER,photo

It is the second largest fish in the world  the whale shark being the largest fish.,HER,photo
Hammerheads use their unique head to help scan when hunting down their prey. In addition to specialized eyes  hammerheads have unique sensors across their heads to help detect food.

International demand for their meat  fins and oil remains a threat to the species  particularly by unregulated fisheries.

WWF's Solutions-- Despite these challenges  we can create a prosperous future that provides food  water and energy for the 9 or 10 billion people who will be sharing the planet in 2050.  WWF urges governments at Rio+20 to start valuing nature in order to ensure food  water  and energy security. With the impact of our ecological footprint in mind  we must protect our natural resources while providing socio-economic benefits and allowing for sustainable development.  The challenge of sustaining life on an increasingly crowded planet is growing more complicated every day. How do we feed a growing global population and still maintain a living planet? WWF works to provide recommendations  that when taken together  could enable farms to feed 10 billion people and keep Earth habitable.  Help protect our planet. Your actions don't need to be huge or require large sacrifices. Small actions can make a big difference. Some actions include:  - Join WWF's free Conservation Action Network and help make a difference.

Australia declares the world's biggest network of marine protected areas  which covers more than 1.1 million square miles of ocean!,HER,link
In 2007 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded with “very high confidence” that “recent warming is strongly affecting terrestrial biological systems”; and stated with “high confidence” that “observed changes in marine and freshwater ecological systems are associated with rising water temperatures  as well as related changes in ice cover  salinity  oxygen levels and circulation”.  Some of the most dramatic and important impacts are evident in the Arctic  where the warming has been particularly pronounced. The Arctic holds a vast quantity of land-ice (concentrated in Greenland)  as does the Antarctic and other regions with glaciers  such as the Himalayas. Rising temperatures are shrinking the amount of ice – releasing immense quantities of freshwater into the oceans  and contributing to rising sea levels.  Impacts in the far northern latitudes  including the Arctic  are of particular concern. Dieback of boreal forests  along with thawing permafrost and methane deposits  could release large quantities of greenhouse gases. Similarly  more frequent severe droughts in the Amazon region – as occurred twice over the last decade (2005 and 2010) – can shift carbon from the Amazon’s forests to the atmosphere.

Rapid declines in Atlantic cod fisheries are well documented. As a commodity in world trade  this species has been heavily exploited for several centuries. Its economic importance also means that more population information is available than for most species  allowing trends in Atlantic cod stocks to be tracked back to the 1960s. Historical data for some areas go back even further; data from the Nova Scotian Shelf  Canada  for example  were collected in the 1800s.   The Living Planet Index for Atlantic cod suggests that populations have declined by an average of 74% over the past 50 years. Losses have been greatest in the Northwest Atlantic. The biomass of the Scotian Shelf stock is less than 3% of the pre-industrial fishing level.

Humanity’s annual demand on the natural world has exceeded what the Earth can renew in a year since the 1970s. This “ecological overshoot” has continued to grow over the years  reaching a 50% deficit in 2008. This means that it takes 1.5 years for the Earth to regenerate the renewable resources that people use  and absorb the CO2 waste they produce  in that same year.  How can this be possible when there is only one Earth? Just as it is possible to withdraw money from a bank account faster than to wait for the interest this money generates  renewable resources can be harvested faster than they can be re-grown. But just like overdrawing from a bank account  eventually the resource will be depleted. At present  people are often able to shift their sourcing when this happens; however at current consumption rates  these sources will eventually run out of resources too—and some ecosystems will collapse even before the resource is completely gone.

Today  very few rhinos survive outside national parks and reserves. Rhinos are threatened by poaching due to the demand for their horns  and habitat loss  a result of human populations encroaching on the land and the destruction of forests. WWF works to strengthen protected areas in Africa and Asia and stop illegal trade of rhino horns. http://bit.ly/KMJGw9,HER,photo
The Sumatran rhino is the smallest of the living rhinoceroses and the only Asian rhino with two horns. They have red brown skin and noticeable wrinkles around the eyes. Once widespread on Borneo  they now only exist in the northeast state of Sabah in Malaysia. They are possibly extinct from their former habitat in the states of Sarawak (Malaysia) and Kalimantan (Indonesia). http://bit.ly/LvqqAH,HER,photo
Rhinoceroses are universally recognized because of their massive bodies  short legs and one or two horns. In some rhino species the horn is small and not easily visible. Rhinos have poor eyesight  but their sense of smell and hearing are well developed. http://bit.ly/KMJGw9,HER,photo
The black rhinoceros has two horns and occasionally a third small posterior horn is present. The species is distinguished from the white rhino by a hook-like upper lip used to feed on twigs of woody plants and a variety of plants. Black rhinos weigh one to two tons and have skin that ranges from dark yellow brown to dark gray. All black rhinos scrape their feet on communal dung heaps so their scent is left along the path they travel. http://bit.ly/LwEOJa,HER,photo

As much as 50% of Sumatra’s forests have been destroyed since 1985  mostly by clearance for pulp  paper and palm oil production. A new interactive map  from WWF and Google Earth Outreach  allows users to visualize what is really happening to these forests. http://bit.ly/M8D6zy,HER,video
Freshwater ecosystems  home to 10% of all known animal species  provide services vital to the health and stability of human communities  including fisheries  water for agricultural and domestic use  hydrological flow regulation  navigation and trade  pollution control and detoxification services. But numerous pressures  including land use change  water use  infrastructure development  pollution and global climate change  working individually and collectively  are impinging on the health of rivers and lakes around the world.  The Living Planet Report 2012 states that the rapid development of water management infrastructure – such as dams  dykes  levees and diversion channels – have left very few rivers entirely free flowing. Of the approximately 177 rivers greater than 1 000km in length  only a third remains free flowing.   Learn more : http://www.facebook.com/worldwildlifefund/app_417953298235415,HER,photo
More than 50% of the global population now lives in urban areas. This figure is expected to increase  as the world is rapidly urbanizing  particularly in Asia and Africa.  Globally  urban residents are already responsible for more than 70% of the fossil fuel related to CO2 emissions. However  well planned cities can also reduce direct carbon emissions by good management of the density and availability of collective transport. For example  per capita emissions in New York City are 30% less than the U.S. average.  More about the Living Planet Report: http://www.facebook.com/worldwildlifefund/app_417953298235415,HER,photo

The calf was named Imbo  derived from the word rimbo  which means forest in the traditional Malayan language spoken in central Sumatra.,HER,photo
Lisa  a female elephant on WWFs Flying Squad  gave birth to a male calf a full month earlier than anticipated by her handlers at the Flying Squad basecamp in Tesso Nilo National Park  Sumatra  Indonesia.  More photos: http://www.worldwildlife.org/what/wherewework/borneo/elephantflyingsquad.html,HER,photo
Imbo is the third calf born in the Flying Squad in the past four years which is an indication that the elephants are receiving good treatment and have the perfect habitat to breed.,HER,photo
An Elephant Flying Squad consists of nine people with noise and light-making devices  motorbikes and four trained elephants that drive wild elephants back into the forest whenever they threaten to enter villages. It has proven to be very effective in reducing losses suffered by local communities near Tesso Nilo.,HER,photo
Tesso Nilo is a prime habitat for endangered species like Sumatran tigers and Sumatran elephants. There are an estimated 200 wild elephants in the national park. Unfortunately  large-scale deforestation and habitat degradation  especially for oil palm plantations  has led to increased human-wildlife conflict.,HER,photo
The uniqueness of the Flying Squad could certainly boost ecotourism opportunities in Tesso Nilo National Park  said Ir. Sumarto  Director of Environmental Services Utilization of Conservation Area and Protected Forest  Ministry of Forestry. There is a lot of potential here that could benefit both wildlife and people.,HER,photo
Overall  the Flying Squads elephants are in healthy condition and Im very pleased that the two other calves are being trained to join the Flying Squad team and support ecotourism activities in Tesso Nilo National Park  said Drh. Hayani MSc  Head of Tesso Nilo National Park.,HER,photo
In 2004  WWF introduced the first Elephant Flying Squad to a village near the newly-established Tesso Nilo National Park in central Sumatra  Indonesia. It was introduced to bring short-term relief to the conflict between people and elephants and to create support for elephant conservation among communities.,HER,photo

“Almost all of the models were from local Portland  OR rescues. Before doing the actual shake photo we would get a nice head shot for the rescue to post on their website.

I had my assistants  Amanda Giese and Tanya Paul  who are also professional animal care technicians  on site to do nail trims and ear cleanings. The ear cleanings are what generally caused the shake to happen  I just had to be ready.” - Carli Davidson Pet Photography  As a special thanks to our fans  we're giving away eight (8) copies of 'Shake Cats' from award-winning photographer Carli Davidson.

Hello All   Please go watch the video to the right  on a large puppy mill that has been put out of business!

We have had more people sign the Obama Family Dog petition than we could ever have imagined. It shows clearly just how many Americans believe in adoption!

Hi Trish   The Obamas HAVE said they are getting a dog after the election win or lose. It's a deal Sen. Obama made with his daughters.  If he ran for President  they could get a dog.  Of course we would never encourage a family to bring an animal into their lives if they were not ready. We would like to encourage them  and everyone to adopt once they decide they are ready.,LER,status
On Sunday  the Best Friends Rapid Response team  on the water in Oakville  Iowa  rescued a cat from a precarious spot.  The adult children of the cat’s person  worried about George  had contacted the Best Friends team asking for help. So the team motored in their boat to the home  which had about a foot of water inside. The Best Friends crew sloshed around  searching through each room and each closet. But … no George.  Then they reached the kitchen  where there are lots of places to hide. Ethan Gurney began opening cupboards and  sure enough  there was George  hiding in one. “He’s looking a little grumpy  but not too bad ” Ethan said as he lifted George out of the cupboard. (George was later reunited with his grateful person.),LER,video

After spending 10 long hours on the Iowa River on Thursday  the Best Friends Rapid Response team was called to the scene of a cat stuck in a tree surrounded by high waters.  So that night  Rapid Response manager Rich Crook and first responder Ethan Gurney got back in their flat-bottomed boat and motored back out to Oakville – for one last run of the day.  As they moved upstream and neared a long row of trees  Ethan began to whistle. That’s when the cat started meowing. “Sure enough ” Rich says  “there was the cat  in a tree.”,LER,video

Hi Brandie!  Funny you should ask.  Just last year  a young man named Andrei visited us here at the Sanctuary.  He along with some other young people run a newspaper dedicated to animal welfare.  They do want to do more  so he and another colleague came to Best Friends to learn more.  http://news.bestfriends.org/index.cfm?page=news&mode=entry&entry=E41975DB-BDB9-396E-987AB731D4FF9C73  http://news.bestfriends.org/index.cfm?page=news&mode=entry&entry=C0E73420-BDB9-396E-95A54F29C348BC37  There are a couple of stories about him.  I know we are continuing to work with Andrei to help his group make headway with things like informing Romanians about basic animal care  and things like spay/neuter.  I will try to keep you updated! ,LER,status

Last year  NFL star Michael Vick made national headlines for his involvement in a large  very well organized dog fighting ring. As the legal process unfolded  Best Friends Animal Society made the case that the dogs were the victims  and they did not deserve to die like so many others have. The dogs arrived here at the Sanctuary in early 2008  and it has been clear from the start that these dogs did deserve a second chance. It is hoped that their story can help change perceptions of the dogs that come from fighting backgrounds.,LER,video
Hundreds of animals make their way through the Best Friends Animal Sanctuary every year. Many are immediately adoptable  but some need to special care to get them back into loving homes. This video profiles the animals we come to know  as the "Guardian Angels.",LER,video

I don’t have access to a cessation program. How I can get help to quit?  As of 2009  all 50 states and the District of Columbia run some type of free telephone-based program that links callers with trained counselors. These specialists help plan a quit method that fits each person's unique smoking pattern. People who use telephone counseling are twice as likely to stop smoking as those who don't get this type of help. Help from a counselor can keep quitters from making many common mistakes.

It makes me realize how easy it is for us to come to Christ in the West.  It costs us nothing like this. (Eventually it should cost us everything but  I lost no family over being baptized)  I remember as a child here  at a baptism  seeing the suitcases lined up because people realized being baptized meant they would no longer have a place to live.

Little lives beginning under immensely tough conditions: A young mother crosses the border from Syria and becomes a refugee. She carries her one-month-old son Hamid  who has known non-stop bombing since the start of his young life.   Babies like Hamid  whose earliest days are lived in exile  may face trouble down the road because it can be so difficult for refugee parents to register children's births. It may seem like paperwork  but it's so much more than that: children whose births have not been properly registered risk difficulty accessing services  problems crossing borders  and even the possibility of statelessness.

On this first day of Ramadan  Ziad  31  returns to his family’s caravan  after working a shift as a door guard in Zaatari refugee camp.  “Last Ramadan I was in prison ” this father of 3  told me.  His wife and children would call him.  “Come home papa  come home ” but each time he would have to tell them  “I can’t  the door is locked.” He becomes emotional as he remembers those days  recalling that he was unable to buy gifts for his children.  Last year he was in a prison and this year he's a refugee. “It’s like death” Ziad says.  “My parents and all my brothers and sisters are still in Syria.” As I speak with him  the TV in the background reports bombing in his home village.  It’s a constant internal struggle not to pick everything up and return  but the safety of his young family  and another baby on the way  keeps him rooted.  “Every day my son Tarek prays with me ” he says. Ziad is far from being home  but at least he is with his children this Ramadan.   Photo and story by Jared Kohler for UNHCR,HER,photo

Did you know  France is one of the main destinations for asylum-seekers in Europe? in 2012 alone  France received about  55 000 new asylum applications. Many French cities are facing an acute shortage of accommodation.  The government is trying to address the problem and  in February 2013  announced the creation of 4 000 additional places for asylum seekers in state-run reception centers. But many are still forced to occupy empty buildings. One of them  dubbed the “Refugee Hotel” by the people that live there  is on the outskirts of the eastern city of Dijon. It's a former meat-packing plant. The authorities have tried to close the squat several times. These images show the desperate state of the building and depict the people who call it home. http://rfg.ee/lHjCF,HER,photo

In March 2011  we initiated a project with the South African NGO  Lawyers for Human Rights (LHR)  to tackle the issue of statelessness. Some of the goals of the project included providing legal services to stateless people and those at risk of statelessness and to raise awareness about stateless people and their rights. LHR had conceived the project after noticing that large numbers of Zimbabwean-born asylum-seekers were telling its staff that they faced problems getting jobs  studying or setting up businesses – all allowed under South African law. They told LHR that when they applied for Zimbabwean passports  necessary to access these rights  they were informed by consular officials that they were no longer recognized as Zimbabwean citizens. This effectively made them stateless. Since the project’s inception  LHR has reached more than 2 000 people who are stateless or at risk of statelessness. These people came from more than 20 different countries. It has identified numerous categories of concern in South Africa  both migrants and those born in the country. The following photos portray some of the people who have been  or are being  helped. Some of the subjects asked that their names be changed.,HER,photo

At camps in Burkina Faso  refugees from Mali express their concerns through an elders committee  a sanitation committee and a youth committee. By organizing such groups  refugees are better able to contribute to decisions that affect their daily lives.  Here  the main committee at Mentao Refugee Camp is in session. How do you help shape decisions in your community?   ©UNHCR/ H. Reichenberger,HER,photo

Did you know half of the world's refugees are living in urban environments? That means  they're not in camps  but scattered in cities and villages  and often counting on the generosity of locals.

These people have been on the move for several weeks. They are part of the 32 000-strong group of refugees who entered South Sudan through Elfoj some weeks ago. UNHCR and partners immediately relocated them for safety reasons (away from the border) to a temporary site called Hofra which soon ran out of water. So we moved them to Kilo 18 which had adequate water to last two weeks. Almost immediately when that stage of the operation was completed  we began to relocate the people  giving priority to the most vulnerable  to Yusuf Batil where they will start a new life. As of today  25 000 have moved and the relocation operation should be completed by the middle of this week... weather conditions permitting.  ,HER,photo

Whenever they came across water  they would stop and rest their swollen feet and arms sore from carrying children and whatever they could bring of their lives back home.

I was really discouraged - thinking I'm never going to be able to do a marathon - but then I thought - I have to take SMALL steps towards my BIG goal! Just like our RMHC families going through a tough time - it's the small wins along the way that add up to victory!

And what a perfect day to start building motivation for the months of training & ultimately the race - because today I'm in the Nation's Capitol visiting one of the amazing patients of the Ronald McDonald Care Mobile. As I ran down the Potomac this morning I said to myself  "I'm running for CJ and his Ronald McDonald Care Mobile program!" Who are you running for? www.rmhc.org/chicagomarathon,LER,link

Hi RMHC friends! For all our basketball fans and ballers out there  I have a special announcement from our friends at McDonald's!

Hi everyone! Back in the windy city and reminiscing about our great visit to RMHC Austin and Central Texas. There was nothing but LOVE in that House.

All of your comments are so appreciated though - it's wonderful that the families that we serve have an extended support group online!,LER,photo
Here are some more photos from my visit to the Atlanta Ronald McDonald House!,LER,photo
Volunteering is a HUGE part of what makes RMHC so amazing.

More than 100 000 elephants were killed by poachers between 2010 and 2012  leading some scientists to predict that African forest elephants could be extinct within the decade. The United States is a significant market for ivory.  Following is a statement by NRDC President Rhea Suh: “The truth of the matter is that the United States plays a very real role in the slaughter of African elephants. Our trade and import of ivory is part of the demand that is driving the near-extermination of this species.  That’s why our country needs to do everything in its power to protect these endangered and iconic animals. “Restricting sales and helping to reduce demand is a critical part of the solution. Though we still have plenty of work to do to protect elephants for good  these new regulations take us one step closer.” #ivory #elephants #conservation,HER,photo

Today  June 6  in 1944  Allied forces descended upon the beaches of Normandy  France in what is known as D-Day.  The D-Day invasion began with a dangerous attack by American paratroopers. Dropped behind enemy lines to soften up the German troops and to secure needed targets  the paratroopers knew that if the accompanying assault by sea failed -- there would be no rescue.  While nearly 7 000 Allied navy and merchant vessels pushed toward the beaches of Normandy  overhead  12 000 bombers and fighter planes poured inland. Their coordinated actions secured an Allied foothold in France that helped lead to the end of World War II.  More from our National Museum of American History: http://s.si.edu/11jwItj  Photo: Parachutes open overhead as waves of paratroops land in Holland during operations by the 1st Allied Airborne Army  Sept. 1944  courtesy of US National Archives.  Thanks to PBS's American Experience for partial text.  Clarification from Kathy Golden  associate curator  Division of Armed Forces History: Regarding "a dangerous attack by American paratroopers" in the text above  the phrase “Allied paratroopers” is more accurate (and among the Allied paratroopers were Americans  British  and Canadians).,HER,photo

Rookie (magazine) on how to find and create the best #selfcare routine and skills best suited for you! You are worthy of nurturing yourself and deserve relaxation! 💖  "No one can tell you what self-care skills will be best for you. Things like bubble baths work for lots of people because they’re warm and smell good and you can’t do work while bubbling it up  but don’t think that’s the only way to take care of yourself. The important thing to connect to when creating your own list of self-care skills is what your emotions were before you did the action and what they were after. This regulation isn’t an accident  but rather a deliberate action by you to help yourself."   http://www.rookiemag.com/2016/02/self-care/,LER,link

Today is World Pneumonia Day  an opportunity to raise awareness of what has been called a “forgotten killer of children.”  Working with local health authorities  the IRC has built a network of 13 000 community health workers in six countries as a first line of defense against pneumonia and other childhood killers.

“Prior to the conflict  the local population in #Syria were used to drinking chlorinated water. Imagine it were you and everything you took for granted was all of a sudden taken away. Would you know how to manage? Would you know how to make your water safe for your children? It’s a completely alien situation. People know their water is bad  but they don’t have the skills or knowledge to do anything about it. For years and years  they just opened the tap and drank the water.”  The IRC's Bibi Lamond speaks about how the IRC is responding to the #polio outbreak in Syria on the ground: http://bit.ly/1b02CjU  Photo: Peter Biro/IRC,HER,photo

After World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed #Syria's first #polio outbreak in 14 years  IRC president David Miliband spoke to BBC Newsabout the danger of the disease spreading.  The IRC has 300 000 doses of vaccine ready  but Miliband explains that we don't have safety and security for our aid workers  which serves as a jolting reminder that "while there may be progress on the chemical weapons front  the misery  the death and decay of Syria and the neighboring countries is immense."

After confirmed cases of polio have emerged in #Syria  the IRC's David Miliband is calling for a ceasefire so the IRC and other humanitarian organizations can deliver crucial #polio vaccines:  ""This is an urgent problem: 1 out of 200 children infected with the polio virus develops paralysis. The other 199 that are infected do not develop the disease  but are spreading the virus and infecting others. An immunization campaign is urgently needed in these regions and the IRC is ready to act  and can reach up to 300 000 people quickly  but we need safe access and supply."

Access to health care is a major problem in Chin  a remote area of #Myanmar (also known as #Burma). Most villages are cut off from even basic services. Poverty and low levels of literacy contribute to a lack of knowledge about hygiene and health.    In response  the IRC has trained 100 community health workers to detect  refer and treat common diseases like malaria. Meanwhile  50 IRC auxiliary midwives have been trained in safe delivery  newborn care  first aid and patient referral. One of the midwives  Tintin Nwe  20  cares for expectant mothers in Kha Ohn Wa.   “I can treat common illnesses and I know when to send women to the nearest health post if I recognize complications ” she says as she examines a patient in her house.

We are connected economically. We are connected by such threats as terrorism and global warming. But the most fundamental argument for why we should care  and for what the IRC does  is a moral one.

Even before a massive earthquake devastated Haiti in January 2010  extreme poverty was widespread. Most Haitians had no jobs  and families unable to care for their children routinely placed them in orphanages.   Carnise and her husband Dieuseul  farmers in northeast Haiti  couldn't afford to keep their children in school and were persuaded by a local pastor to enroll them in his orphanage.   “When the pastor came to the house he told us that their lives would be better at the orphanage ” says Carnise. “We believed him. Of course I was very sad seeing my children go  but I thought it was the best thing we could do for their future. I trusted him."  But as the IRC discovered  this pastor kept the children in poor conditions and forced them to work with no pay. Now  with the IRC's help  this family has happily reunited.

For the next 16 years we lived in a refugee camp.   We arrived in New York airport and staff from the IRC were there to receive us. Now we've been here for four years and we feel secure because we know how to get around  we have friends  and our son has done very well in his school  he has received a scholarship to college.   We were successful in our journey. Of course we still struggle but we are not failing  we are succeeding. We are making our life.

During the elections in Kenya five years ago  political rivalry led to violence that left 1 300 people dead and widespread destruction.  So  before the elections this March  the IRC's Peace Initiative Kenya worked with local partners on an innovative way to make sure the process remained peaceful - on the radio.   Their popular radio drama  "Gutuka " (Awaken in Swahihi) aired across Kenya before and after the elections and reached over 1.5 million listeners. According to many observers  its themes of open dialogue  peace and encouraging women to be part of the political process played a major role in assuring the elections were for the most part peaceful.  Farmer Rose Nyawara (center)  shown here with staff from Kenya's Nam Lolwe radio station  was awarded an exotic goat  in a competition for fans of the radio drama.

Renewed violence in Darfur  Sudan has driven 50 000 people into eastern Chad. But Chad is already struggling to recover from a decade of recurring crises — drought  flooding and conflict — and this influx of uprooted people is putting stress on a region where water is already scarce.

The IRC is providing aid to survivors of a fire at a refugee camp in Thailand that killed 37 people on Friday.  The fire destroyed hundreds of makeshift huts at the Ban Mae Surin camp in northwest Thailand  which is home to some 3 500 ethnic Karen refugees who have fled ethnic conflict in neighboring Myanmar. The fire injured more than 100 refugees  left 2 300 homeless and also destroyed the camp’s clinic and hospital.   Preliminary reports indicate that the blaze may have been started by a cooking accident.   “We are deeply saddened by this tragic event and the IRC is doing everything it can to provide swift aid and support to the survivors ” said Christine Petrie  director of IRC programs in Thailand.   An IRC medical team arrived on the scene shortly after the fire broke out  Petrie said  and is providing medical treatment  mosquito nets  blankets and working to ensure that the water supply remains clean.   The Ban Mae Surin camp  which is located three miles from the Myanmar border  was erected in 1992 and was intended to be a temporary shelter. But despite recent political reforms in Myanmar  the camp’s refugees are reluctant to return home  citing concern for their safety. Many were born and have grown up in the camp.

Each day  34-year-old Abdiya Abdi Mohamud would set out from Bokolmayo  her village in Ethiopia  on a round trip journey of more than nine miles to collect river water.    It could be a dangerous trip—Abdiya knows of women who were assaulted along the way—and it took precious time from other important tasks. Children even missed school to help collect water for their families. And for all the risk and sacrifice  the water they lugged back to the village wasn’t good. “It was salty and dirty ” Abdiya recalls. People became sick.    All that changed when the IRC built a water system for a nearby refugee camp  with a pipeline branching out to Bokolmayo.  Now  Abdiya and nearly 4 700 of her neighbors in surrounding villages walk a short distance to turn on a tap for clean water.   Now that she no longer spends several hours each day hauling water jugs  Abdiya has been able to add to her family’s income by running a small store selling soap  cosmetics and house wares (pictured here). She also rents out two rooms as classrooms—and she is thrilled to see the community’s children back in school and in much better health.

IRC volunteers who travel throughout the Kati district of Mali to identify malnourished children and inform villagers about available help found 16 month-old Jabadjie on the brink of death  weighing barely 9 pounds and suffering from pneumonia and anemia. She was rushed to a clinic in Kati  and after a few weeks of intensive care and a nutritious feeding regimen she showed signs of recovery. After one month  her weight more than doubled to 20 pounds  normal for her age.   She continues to recover under the care of her grandmother in a village one day’s journey by foot and car from the health center. An IRC team regularly checks on her and supplies her and other children in a similar situation with food supplements to ensure they do not relapse into malnutrition.

As promised  here's the story behind one of the photos we posted earlier (the other one is coming up later this afternoon):  This mother of young children had been living as a refugee with her husband and children in Iran. When they returned to Afghanistan in 2012 they no longer had a home. They built a mud brick hut in a temporary camp for refugee returnees in Kabul  and they worry that they will be evicted from the private land. The woman's husband is having a difficult time finding work. Like most refugee returnees he does day labor when he can find it.   This woman asked to pose with her family to convey how difficult and uncertain life is in this place. The IRC is trying to provide some stability for children here  by opening a temporary school serving 40 children.  (Photo: Ned Colt/IRC),HER,photo

The will to learn is a powerful thing.   Her entire life  Brigitte dreamt of the moment she would be able to spell her name. When she was a little girl  her parents separated and she was sent to live with an aunt to babysit her cousins. They all ended up going to school  but she was kept at home.   When she was 17  she moved to live with her husband. Although he knew how to read and write  he never taught his wife the alphabet.   When the International Rescue Committee started a program to teach young people in the Democratic Republic of Congo the basics of reading  writing and math  nothing would stop 28 year-old Brigitte from enrolling – not even the age limit of 25.    “We told her we could not take her  but she would just come and sit outside  in the sun  and peek through the window to see what we were writing on the blackboard ” recalls instructor Françoise Kondo Mwayuma. “She would plead with us until she would start crying  and just would not take no for an answer.” Brigitte’s determination paid off and soon she found herself sitting at a desk for the first time in her life  learning how to spell her name – the exciting first step of her education.

Four days after Kenyans cast their votes for the first time since the disputed 2007 national elections  the mood in the country is anxious but calm as they await results.  Five years ago  weeks of post-election violence killed nearly 1 500 people and uprooted more than 500 000.  Monday’s elections were largely peaceful  despite technical issues that resulted in long queues at the polls and a delay in the vote count. This progress owes to the resolve of Kenyans who have been working together to promote peace  says Jebiwot Sumbeiywo  who runs the IRC’s “Peace Initiative Kenya” program.   In the months leading up to the election  the IRC and our partners in Kenya worked in communities across the country  disseminating messages promoting peace and tolerance through text  radio and social media; training peace activists and police officers on strategies to avoid violence; and setting up “early warning” violence hotlines and text messaging systems.  Today  IRC teams delivered emergency supplies to hospitals and other health facilities on the Kenyan coast  to help them prepare should violence break out. Though uneasiness is evident tonight  all of us hope that no matter what happens tomorrow  Kenya’s future will be peaceful.

Ten years after the invasion of Iraq  1.3 million Iraqis remain displaced. Forced to flee during the war  many are in a state of limbo  without homes to return to.  Many live with limited or no access to school  clean water  health care or permanent housing and live in constant fear of eviction. An influx of refugees from the crisis in Syria puts additional strain on limited resources. This woman  pictured with her children  escaped violence in Syria after her husband was killed and now resides in Domiz camp.

At a Village Savings and Loan Association (VSLA) meeting in eastern Congo last week  women cheered for a fellow member who deposited enough money into the collective's pool that week to buy the maximum number of shares – five.   The woman's money will increase the value of the common fund and will go towards loans that the VSLA gives out to its members. Loans are repaid with interest  and all money thus collected over a period of up to nine months is then disbursed to the women based on how much each one contributed to the fund.   The IRC supports over 120 VSLAs  helping women and men save money collectively  take out loans  and learn new business skills.

Thank you to everyone who sent a letter through our website  urging the Obama administration to ensure that sufficient U.S. funds go toward protecting Syrian women and girls. Your voice was heard.    The United States government just announced  ahead of a pledging conference in Kuwait tomorrow  that they will make a significant pledge of assistance for the millions of Syrians affected by the humanitarian crisis. In his announcement  President Obama said that the aid will support healthcare for victims of sexual violence  among other things. Sexual violence has been a significant and disturbing feature of the civil war in Syria.    That's a great start  but there is still work to be done. The U.N. now estimates that there are over 700 000 refugees in the region  200 000 of whom fled Syria in the past 7 weeks.  “The humanitarian disaster in and around Syria is immense and growing steadily worse ” said the IRC’s president  George Rupp. “We are encouraged by early and significant pledges by the US and UK governments and hope other nations will step up as well. It is critical that funding appeals are met  bilateral aid is scaled up for countries hosting large numbers of refugees  and diverse channels are used to get lifesaving aid to Syrians in dire need.”,HER,photo

Increasing violence in Mali poses grave consequences for civilians already suffering  the effects of political instability  mass displacement and severe food shortages.   “People continue to flee their homes  most of them women and children ” says Tasha Gill  who oversees the International Rescue Committee’s humanitarian aid programs in Mali. “Communities taking in displaced families have been very generous up until now  but their resources are rapidly depleting and they have little else to offer.”     Gill says it is imperative that the international community  the Malian government  and all actors in the conflict prioritize protection of children and their families caught in conflict zones.   The IRC is assisting vulnerable families in northern and southern Mali – providing safe drinking water  treating malnourished children   preventing the spread of disease  and working with partners to provide education.

Kenya has hosted refugees fleeing conflict in neighboring Somalia  Sudan and Ethiopia since the early 1990's. Now  after erroneously accusing refugees of recent violence in Nairobi  they have ordered all refugees to move to a distant refugee camp. Many refugees have also been the victims of arbitrary arrests and harassment  in some cases having to use their scarce resources to bribe police.  This new directive disrupts the lives that urban refugees have begun to rebuild for themselves and puts a strain on all refugees and aid organizations in Kenya. The camp they have been directed to is already overcrowded and lack many necessities like clean water and sanitation  health care  schools and security guards.  Miriam fears what kind of life she will be able to provide for herself and her three grandchildren after being forced to relocate. “I have no idea how I am expected to start a new life in a refugee camp at my age ” she says.

When families are forced to flee  they run for their lives  grabbing their children and what little they can carry — leaving the rest behind.  There’s often no time to pack the most basic items  even a change of clothing.   Thousands of women who fled recent fighting in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo’s North Kivu province are sheltering with their families in makeshift camps in and around the city of Goma. Their safety is at stake when they try to find a private place away from the crowds to wash themselves and their clothing. Another risk is infection  when women without spare clothes must put just-laundered garments back on before they have a chance to dry.   The IRC is doing its part to help  delivering 3 000 emergency kits to women and girls that include extra sets of clothing  sanitary items  washing buckets and soap. The kits also include flashlights with extra batteries  and a whistle for women to signal for help if they are in danger. We plan to distribute 5 000 more kits in the coming weeks.   “We can’t believe this — we never have things just for us ” one woman told Aisha Bain  the IRC's emergency team leader in Congo  last week. “I am filled with joy and gratitude.”   Below: a displaced woman living in a camp near Goma holds up a colorful pagne cloth garment that was part of the emergency kit she received from the IRC last week.

On the blog  IRC President George Rupp shares another snapshot the IRC’s work - the story of Minhaj Gedi Fara  who emerged from famine- and violence-choked Somalia in late July 2011 weighing less than seven pounds. A picture taken of the suffering child by a photojournalist visiting the IRC health center in Kenya’s Dadaab refugee complex became the face of the humanitarian crisis in the Horn of Africa.  Three months later  a more joyful image of Minhaj touched the world. After intensive therapeutic feeding and three blood transfusions overseen by the IRC’s Dr. John Kiogora  Minhaj’s weight reached nine pounds — enough to plump up his cheeks and enable his release into the arms of his eager mother. He would still need outpatient treatment for tuberculosis and he was still a refugee  but his life was saved and his recovery was on track.  Today  a few months shy of his second birthday  Minhaj remains in Dadaab  just as the Horn of Africa remains stricken with drought and food insecurity. At a recent checkup at the IRC hospital  he was the picture of health  and his mother could not have been happier. In Dr. Kiogora’s words  “It gives you inspiration and energy to continue serving the people who need you.”  Learn more at http://www.Rescue.org/,HER,photo
Areej has worked at the IRC’s Mafraq clinic since it opened in June 2012. She sees close to 50 patients a day  all of them Syrian refugees. Areej and the doctors see to their medical needs  but so many need more than a checkup and a prescription for free medicine.   Areej is especially drawn to the very young and the very old. “The nature of children is to laugh and play  but when they first come to the clinic they’re so tense ” she says. She keeps a small cache of sweets and chocolate to dole out to the young ones who seem particularly anxious.   For older patients  just the chance to talk can be therapeutic. “They’re often lonely ” says Areej. “They’ve lost family  friends  all that they know and care for. They frequently cry when I speak with them about their homes and family in Syria. They want so much to talk. I soon understood they’re not just here for medical support—emotional support is so important  too.”   This winter  the IRC is expanding its clinics in Mafraq and Ramtha to provide that emotional support to refugees  with a focus on women and girls. “All of these refugees have multiple needs ” says Areej. “This way  we’ll be able to better meet both their medical and emotional requirements.”  Learn more about the IRC’s emergency responses around the world at https://www.Rescue.org,HER,photo
On the blog  IRC President George Rupp writes about the New Roots farming initiative  an innovative IRC program that brings dignity  a sense of community and economic self-sufficiency to refugees resettled in the United States:  From San Diego to the South Bronx  New Roots is enabling hundreds of resettled refugees to grow their own healthy foods  earn income by selling their harvest to restaurants and at farmers markets  and build community with others starting new lives in America.    During Ah Lun’s youth in Myanmar  growing vegetables and other crops was an important part of his family’s livelihood.  But one day  he was captured by soldiers intent on forcing him to join the army and take up arms.  On foot through the jungle and then by train  he escaped to Malaysia.  Six years later  he arrived in New York City.   Today  Ah Lun’s industrious nature has made him a leader at Drew Gardens in the Bronx  where he helps less experienced refugee farmers coax eggplant  chili peppers  and other crops from the two-acre plot.  His skills also earned him attention — and a job offer — from famed New York chef  restaurateur  and New Roots supporter David Burke.

On the blog  IRC President George Rupp shares how two snapshots of our work in Congo  from two provinces where civil war has raged for more than a dozen years  show the spectrum of hope that can emerge from that commitment:  In North Kivu  hundreds of thousands of displaced people face the daily threat of infectious diseases  sexual violence  and breakdowns in the rudimentary health care system. Our supremely dedicated teams provide emergency assistance  shelter  medical care for victims of sexual assault  and medicine to slow the rate of cholera.   In South Kivu  where conditions are more stable  the IRC is able to promote long-term recovery. For example  we have shown women how to establish 40 village savings and loan associations funded by a dynamic membership of 900 investors. As a result  once-destitute women are opening small businesses  acquiring land  raising animals  and paying household expenses.  The IRC works tirelessly in Congo to bring direly-needed emergency services and then remains  to ensure a sustainable road to recovery and stability.  Support the IRC’s work – all donations on https://www.Rescue.org/ will be matched through December 31st.,HER,photo
Bushra Naji  a refugee and IRC volunteer  tells how the IRC helped her family when they arrived in the United States:  Six years ago  I quit my job as a teacher and said goodbye to my friends and my Baghdad neighborhood. The daily threat of violence in Iraq had become unbearable. My eldest son  Zaid  had been shot in both legs and my second son  Omar  had been kidnapped several times by extremists. When it became clear to us that our sons would be killed if we stayed  we fled to Syria and were accepted for resettlement in the United States.  In New York City  the IRC found us an apartment. When we arrived  the refrigerator was filled with familiar foods. They showed us how to use the subway and bus lines.   Now  I am an aide for people with mental illness and a volunteer for the IRC  helping resettled refugee children prepare for public school. Through his job  my husband is training to become a master electrician.  The IRC is like my family. They gave us their all.

Thousands of people displaced by recent fighting between rebels and the Congolese army have flocked to makeshift camps on the outskirts of Goma  the capital of North Kivu province in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The IRC is expanding its emergency response in both North and South Kivu  with a focus on emergency food  health care  cholera prevention and treatment  clean water and sanitation  and assistance for survivors of sexual violence.   These are photos from this week's 4-day  multiagency effort  of which the IRC was part  to distribute critical items like blankets  clothing  water containers and cookware to the more than 22 000 households (or about 110 000 people) in the camps in and around Goma.

The IRC and the University of Nairobi (UoN)  joined forces in 2009 to create the world’s first-ever graduate program offering an Education in Emergencies (EiE) specialization. The goal of the project is to build national and regional humanitarian capacity in the Horn and East Africa to prevent  respond to  and recover from complex emergencies.    The Kenya Forgiveness Project is an inspirational exhibit showcasing stories of forgiveness and reconciliation in Kenya. The project was born out of a deep desire to contribute towards peace in the build up to the 2012 presidential election. The Education in Emergencies specialization invited The Forgiveness Project to the university as a way to illustrate what we can do in our own lives to contribute to healing and reconciliation. Here are some photos of the exhibit.,HER,photo

Wishing a safe and happy holiday to all who are celebrating today!   A beautiful holiday story from Andrea Gardner  IRC case worker in Wichita  Kansas:  "'Why buy gifts for people who already have plenty when there are so many who do not?' That was the question circling the Thanksgiving table this year as my family began to talk about what to do for Christmas. Instead of exchanging gifts  we started a tradition that I hope will continue as the IRC’s new refugee resettlement office in Wichita grows.   In celebration of their families' first holiday season in America  the 16 children the IRC has resettled in Wichita received a special gift.    With my mother as the lead  my grandmother  aunts  uncles and cousins volunteered to fill 16 stockings with age- and gender-appropriate items for each child. The stockings had fun surprises like toys  puzzles and books — but also more practical items such as socks  gloves  pajamas and toiletries. Each stocking also included a $10 Walmart gift card  so that each child could go pick out something special!  I believe this small gesture made these refugee families feel welcomed in their new home. But it was also a blessing to my family to be a small part of making these families’ first holiday season in Wichita special."

Ismail Arafat and Safirah Omar's refugee journey began in 2003 when they left their conflict-ridden native country of Myanmar for neighboring Thailand. From there  smugglers transported them south to Malaysia.    When the IRC's Peter Biro shared their story on our blog last year  they were in the midst of embarking on new lives in Salt Lake City  where they had been resettled with their baby daughter  Norwana. “I hope that I will have a good job  maybe in a shop  and a car and a house ” an optimistic Ismail told Peter. “But most of all  I know we have freedom and that our child will become educated. Life is good here.”  An IRC caseworker helped the couple get on their feet during their first months in the U.S.  working with them to find housing  jobs and medical care and to enroll in English classes.

19-year-old Susan Kayongo was brought up by her grandmother in Eastleigh  one of Nairobi  Kenya’s poorest neighborhoods.   She did well in primary school but could not afford to continue her education. In a country lacking economic opportunities for girls  Susan's future looked bleak. Then she heard about an IRC program called Girls Empowered by Microfranchise — GEM — which aims to rescue teens from poverty by helping them create their own small businesses.   Susan joined the program and went on to open a salon with nine other teenagers. The women sell beauty products and hair extensions as well as style hair. And they continue to receive training and mentorship that will help them to grow their businesses into successful enterprises.

"When I first picked up my American passport — the key item attesting to my citizenship — it was like an impossible dream turning into reality. I belonged! That is what citizenship is about." - Andy Grove  co-founder and CEO of Intel Corporation  IRC Overseer   For many refugees who are given sanctuary in the United States  American citizenship represents the ultimate sense of belonging in their new country. With this in mind  the IRC has joined forces with the New Americans Campaign  a nonpartisan effort to help legally permanent residents become American citizens.     Eight million people qualify for citizenship based on their "green card" resident status  but only 8% of them become citizens each year. High application fees  a complex citizenship process  and unscrupulous people who take advantage of individuals seeking legal assistance are just a few of the obstacles they have to deal with.   The IRC’s citizenship program  “Pathways to Citizenship ” focuses on assisting refugees and other vulnerable populations  and is funded by the Grove Foundation.

A message we sent to supporters this afternoon:  As we witness the destruction unleashed by Hurricane Sandy  our thoughts are with all those who are still in harm’s way. We hope you and your loved ones are safe. We would like to let you know what the International Rescue Committee is doing to help.  While the IRC provides lifesaving care and assistance in 44 countries around the world and 22 cities in the United States  we typically do not respond to domestic emergencies. The U.S. is fortunate to have a strong network of highly resourceful first responders. We applaud their courageous efforts to restore safety and security to millions of people affected by the hurricane at home.  The IRC’s relief efforts focus on some of the most vulnerable people in the storm’s path in the Caribbean: displaced families and children in Haiti. Nearly three years after the devastating earthquake struck the capital  Port-au-Prince  many people still live in makeshift tent settlements in areas prone to flooding and mudslides. Soon after the winds died down  IRC’s staff conducted a rapid assessment at 100 affected camps where some 325 000 homeless people continue to live. Tents and other makeshift shelters were severely flooded; poorly maintained latrines were overflowing; and many families simply had nowhere else to go.  Within 24 hours IRC teams began distributing emergency supplies to affected residents. So far they’ve provided tarps  flashlights  water containers  mosquito nets and emergency supplies to 4 200 storm victims. A huge concern in the wake of the hurricane is cholera -- the water-borne disease can kill within hours. The IRC is working closely with other emergency responders to monitor camps where cholera has been a problem in the past. So far health monitors have referred 50 suspected cases of cholera for medical care.  For camp residents who had barely recovered from the damage caused by Hurricane Isaac in August  this second storm delivered a devastating blow. But IRC country director Miriam Castaneda says many show remarkable strength. “There is still a lot of trauma ” she says. “But people here are extremely resilient.”  Learn more about the IRC’s response and how you can help by clicking below.,HER,link
In the midst of all the somber news about devastation from flooding in the United States  Haiti and Nigeria  a happier dispatch:   24-year-old Alphonsine was one of the very first mothers to give birth at the brand new hospital that the IRC built at Bengamisa  in northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo  with funding from the UK government. Inaugurated in October  the state-of-the-art hospital has four wards - Maternity  Surgery  Pediatrics and Internal Medicine - and can receive up to 240 patients at the same time. The IRC also fully equipped the hospital and provided all essential drugs.  In rural Congo  where health facilities are very scarce and poorly equipped  the vast majority of women give birth either at home  unassisted by qualified personnel  or in crumbling mud structures. Maternal mortality here is one of the highest in the world. (Photo: Bienvenu Lomande/IRC),HER,photo
In mid-October the IRC team in Yida refugee camp  South Sudan  received a shipment of drugs and medical supplies for the reproductive health clinic at the IRC's Women and Girls' Wellness Center. The supplies are critical to the lives and wellbeing of pregnant women  babies  new mothers  and survivors or sexual and domestic violence. The IRC is the only provider of services specifically designed for women and girls in Yida  which is home to 60 000 refugees from South Kordofan  Sudan.    Yida refugee camp has been cut off from road access since July because of seasonal rains  and air transport like this one are the only way to get supplies in at the moment. With some 30 000 or more new refugees expected to arrive by the end of the year fleeing renewed fighting in South Kordofan  even these supplies may not be enough  so agencies like the IRC are also preparing for new needs.,HER,photo
We hope everyone in Hurricane / "Superstorm" Sandy's path is staying safe and dry!

Many people don't realize that less than one percent of the federal budget goes to foreign assistance  which covers anything from life-saving vaccinations to girls' education.  -     Governor  you've said before that the United States must exercise greater "soft power." You described foreign assistance as humanitarian  in our strategic interests  and important for encouraging economic opportunity.  How important will this kind of "soft power" be in a Romney administration?  -     Mr. President  your predecessor - President George W.

Last week  IRC reproductive health staff delivered the first baby to be born in the Al-Buraiqa maternity ward of Aden Sora Clinic in southern Yemen -  a little girl who was named Afkar after the IRC-trained midwife who assisted her mother during the birth. After the delivery  the mother was given an injection  known as "anti-D"  to help prevent complications that could arise in future pregnancies as a result of her blood type. The staff also conducted a home visit shortly after the birth to make sure that both mother and baby were doing well – and they were!    The IRC has been supporting the Al-Buraiqa maternity ward with staff  training and supplies since August of this year. Early marriage  conflict  and poverty all work to make Yemen's maternal mortality rate the highest in the Arab world  with an estimated eight mothers dying every day in childbirth. At Al-Buraiqa  the IRC has recruited and trained midwives  doubled the doctors on staff  and provided critical medicine to allow for 24/7 delivery services. Afkar is the first of what will hopefully be many deliveries at the Center.,HER,photo

The IRC is expanding support for Syrian refugee women. After conducting emergency evaluations  the IRC has learned more about how women are being directly targeted by rape and other forms of sexual violence  and that that the dangers do not end once they’ve fled the country.

In Aden  Yemen  IRC community health volunteers are spreading the word about basic health care services available to thousands through an IRC-managed clinic. This month  the IRC's Rebecca Blum accompanied volunteers to a local school  where many families have been living for months after fleeing their homes due to conflict. A volunteer approached a young mother and encouraged her to visit the health clinic's nutrition center because her daughter looked malnourished.    Within just a few hours  that mother arrived with her daughter  who was indeed malnourished and in need of medical treatment. After receiving a full checkup and a stock of Plumpy’nut  a therapeutic food to treat severe malnutrition  the little girl and her mother were on their way  promising to return for follow up visits.     Yemen has the second highest rate of malnutrition in the world  after Afghanistan  and the IRC is on the ground there to ensure that mothers and children like these have access to such life-saving care.,HER,photo

A breath of relief for refugees with asthma: Many people living with asthma have difficulty taking their medication using standard metered-dose inhalers. Add-on devices called spacers are designed to make inhalers easier to use and more effective  but they are prohibitively expensive for many people living with asthma in Kenya. Last October  IRC pharmacist Erenius Ngelecha came up with an alternative for his patients in the Kakuma refugee camp in northwestern Kenya  modifying sanitized one-liter water bottles that would otherwise be thrown away as a spacer substitute. Within a few months  his innovative “spacer” was being used by nearly 100 asthma patients in the camp. (Photo: Jane Yang/IRC),HER,photo

Today in the USA is Mother's Day although we at Direct Relief think of mothers - and their health - every day.

So today we celebrate all mothers and those who are mothering. We celebrate those who do uncelebrated work everyday in remote clinics around the world to make sure a woman beats the odds. We celebrate you who have helped spread the word about our Maternal and Child Health Program or have donated funds to keep the important work going.  Mothers make a difference so today let's take a moment to think of and honor them and what possibilities they bring to the world.

Over the years the Santa Barbara CA based Direct Relief Women of more than 200 women have come together with three goals in mind – educate  engage and fundraise for Direct Relief.    Putting together small events or gatherings that allow for speakers related to Direct Relief to share firsthand their stories and work has been a wonderful educational tool for both Direct Relief supporters and the local community. Partners such as Dr. Harshad Sanghvi have spoken and educated about low cost tools for safe deliveries and Dr. Edna Adan  a nurse and midwife from Somaliland has spoken to groups about the enormous challenges women face in delivering babies in Sub-Saharan Africa.    Direct Relief Women also do a lot of hands on activities such as packing personal care packs or dental kits in our warehouse that go to clinics  or assisting doctors and patients at a Direct Relief sponsored free dental clinic.    They’ve also helped raise a lot of money through their annual Mother’s Day event that they organize and promote. Last year  Direct Relief Women raised over $100 000 to support the Maternal Child Health programs at Direct Relief.    Through their focus on issues related to Maternal and Child Health  they are able to concentrate their efforts on a key issue for Direct Relief’s work and also an issue that is so close to the women’s own interests.  They have made a huge impact on our organization  our programs and to the people who are able to receive better health because of what they do.  We salute you and profoundly thank this group of dedicated  talented and thoughtful women!,LER,photo

The NYTimes ran an article today on Haiti's cholera epidemic  a disease that's spread through fecal contamination of water. Before the devestating earthquake  only 12% of the country had access to piped  treated water and after that number declined rapidly. That set up Haiti as a prime candidate for a cholera outbreak. Ten months after the quake  the country went from 0 cases of cholera to 3 500 dead in about 2.5 months.  Cholera is still a challenge for Haiti. This week  Direct Relief is giving Praecipio International a $20 000 grant to fund the Haiti Epidemic Advisory System (HEAS)--the world’s first National Weather Service-inspired infectious disease forecasting center. This grant will enable them to reactivate the network starting April 1 now that rainy season has begun in Haiti and early reports are already showing a rise in cases—as noted in the article.   The HEAS serves three basic functions:  1) issuance of forecasts for infectious diseases of medical or public health significance; 2) facilitation of the HEAS social network  which produces “live” situational awareness; and  3) facilitation of “switchboard operation” to rapidly connect warning to emergency response.   This will help to provide information to the various health actors around Haiti and lead to more rapid detection and confirmation and then response. It helps us at Direct Relief because we have pre-positioned in Haiti 6 cholera modules and 300 000 sachets of oral rehydration to respond immediately upon confirmation from the HEAS on a cholera spike.

Emergency preparedness packs were created by Direct Relief with input from experienced emergency responders  including physicians from the UCLA School of Medicine  the University of Pittsburgh  emergency field physicians from Australian Aid International  and representatives from the Santa Barbara Public Health Department and provided free of charge to Medical Reserve Corps members.

The packs include supplies for infection control  diagnostics  trauma care  and personal protection. Cal EMSA has adopted Direct Relief’s EMT level MRC pack as the California State standard  and has asked Direct Relief to equip all current MRC units in California.

What does 2 300 shipments of diabetes testing supplies delivered to low-income  uninsured patients at clinics actually mean? Dr. John Hoh at Asian Pacific Health Care Venture in Los Angeles CA shares a personal patient story showing how Direct Relief USA's programs  corporate partnerships and your support make a difference to someone else:  “Those glucose meters will be much appreciated and be put to good use. Thanks for noting my request and keeping us in mind! I gave one of your last  precious meters today to a young Filipina mother living with diabetes who has a severely autistic child. She is challenged to keep her glycemia under control since they are so poor - she was homeless in the past. Has the associated classic high carb high  fat diet that led to severe obesity and diabetes.   While the challenge of poverty and food traditions are difficult  your meter allows her to break down knowledge barriers and will help her know what her diet does to her body. She is motivated to improve her lifestyle and live. She needs to be healthy to care for her autistic daughter’s needs.  Please share this with the donor and let them know these are the kinds of patients who are given the scarce meters and strips.

CVCD is the only institution in Bolivia providing diabetes prevention  care & treatment services to patients regardless of their ability to pay. Since its founding in 2002 more than 100K Bolivians have been tested for diabetes & over 11K cases have been detected through the program.  CVCD works with The Abbott Fund which has provided funding for the past 5 years to purchase glucometers and test strips which allows for the screening of people in rural communities. Once people are identified with having diabetes  their information is recorded via iPad into a database and they’re referred to a CVCD Clinic.  In 2009 CVCD was named 1 of 6 International Diabetes Federation Centers of Education & in 2011 as one of World Diabetes Foundation’s Centers of Excellence.    Direct Relief’s support for CVCD is one of several partnerships designed to address the global diabetes epidemic and the increasing threat of noncommunicable diseases.

Ron is a disabled Vietnam veteran homeless in Boston.  This time  he has been without a home for five months. Ron was in transitional housing  but he says they were not helping and only taking his money.   Ron says he's living moment to moment while hoping for the best  yet he says that never happens.   Ron's story breaks my heart. No one should have to live on the streets homeless  and especially not the men and women who bravely served our country. It's interesting that cities around the U.S. are claiming they have put an end to veteran homelessness  and there has been a lot of progress  but the real truth is many veterans are still without a home and we still have a lot of work to do.,HER,video

Douglas is a disabled veteran living on the streets of Hollywood. He sleeps on the sidewalk every night.  Douglas says wherever he lays his head is home.   There is a big push in this country to end veteran homelessness  and there should be. Douglas is disabled and confined to a wheelchair. He is missing one leg. Clearly there is something wrong if Douglas is calling a sidewalk home.   Service providers have offered Douglas a bed in a shelter  but he finds the streets to be safer. During my Los Angeles trip  I ran into a few people who should not be homeless on Hollywood Blvd  and they were also only offered shelter  yet returned to the streets. I know the folks in Hollywood working to end homelessness and they are giving their all  but obviously  they are not being provided the tools or housing needed to help these people.  All of the folks I met received disability income and qualify for housing  but of course  there has to be housing available.   Douglas says he loves our country  but he feels our government sucks.  Knowing Douglas slept outside the night of this interview  I have to agree with him.   What do you think?,HER,video

Walking down Hollywood Blvd I noticed two homeless women sitting on a bench across the street. It looked as though they had been sitting there for some time because of all the "stuff" they had with them. Maybe they were even living there.

“How can you rebuild a life you’ve never had” ~ Mike  Mike has been on the streets since he was 13 years-old. The powerful quote from Mike validates why we need to focus on ending street homelessness and youth homelessness at the same time  and not just one or the other.  The night before we met  someone stole his backpack with everything he had for his dog.  This is a very powerful video. Mike talks about how people judge him for being homeless  and then judge that he can't take care of his dog. Honestly  most of the general population care more about pets then to do homeless people. Time and time again I've seen people literally freak out over a homeless dog completely ignoring the homeless person.  Mike also shares about how lines outside a store are celebrated  yet homeless people just cannot sit on a sidewalk.  Listen to Mike's second wish. It's very powerful!,HER,video
"How can you rebuild a life you've never had" ~ Mike (homeless since 13 years-old)   What Mike said is spot on why we need to end street homelessness and youth homelessness. Focusing on just one or the other will not end homelessness. We need to close the "front door" and the "back door"!,HER,photo

John is sleeping outside in Philadelphia. He tried shelters  but someone stabbed John trying to steal his boots  so he feels safer sleeping on the streets even though the overnight windchill is reported to be a deadly -11° or worse.   John had a great job in the telecommunications industry fixing police and fire communication systems. He fell on the job  which resulted in serious injuries. John was in a coma for some time  and he claims his homelessness is a result of insurance industry abuse. Clearly John is disabled  yet he has not been approved for disability benefits. John is vulnerable  and he should not be on the streets - period!   Moments before we met John   a woman spit on him simply because John asked her for a cigarette. Like most urban centers anymore  downtown Philadelphia is filled with large groups of homeless people nestled up alongside fancy restaurants  pricey shopping  and executive offices. This mixture of two extremely different socioeconomic classes can be volatile at times. I don't agree with this woman's actions  but something in the past  aggressive panhandling or an intoxicated homeless person verbally assaulting her could have influenced such awful behaviors. We must get people experiencing homelessness the help they need  and we need more funding for educational and awareness campaigns to change public perceptions about homelessness.

Click here: http://invisiblepeople.tv/birthday  It's  that time again. The time of year where Facebook lets you all know I am  now a year older on March 13th. Well  up until the last few years I  hated my birthday. Thanks to all of your generous hearts my birthday has  turned into a real miracle. Over the last three years you've helped  raise $36 000 to help fight homelessness.  PLEASE READ THIS NEXT PARAGRAPH:  "The  stereotypes of people living in poverty throughout the United States  are among the most negative prejudices that we have. And people  basically view particularly homeless people as having no redeeming  qualities" ~ Susan Fiske  Professor of Psychology. Princeton University  Invisible People's work is important!  I  strongly believe that if the general public viewed our homeless  neighbors as being the real people that they are  there wouldn't be such  humiliation and violence against people experiencing homelessness!  Awareness and education on homelessness can change that  and your  support in funding Invisible People is breaking wrong stereotypes and  changing how tens of millions of lives view homeless individuals.  DID  YOU KNOW that Invisible People is the only national awareness and  educational campaign on homelessness? Just turn on the TV and you'll see  anti-smoking ads  don't text and drive videos are all over the  internet  and causes from the need to recycle to global warming are  everywhere we look  and they should be. Yet except for Invisible People   there are zero campaigns teaching the general public about  homelessness.  This year I turn 54 years-old. 54 is kind of a big  number and most birthday campaigns ask for donations based on the age.  So let's cut my age in half. If each and every one of you could simply  make a donation of $27 it would go a long way to reaching our goal. Of  course   if you would like to donate $54 000  or even $5 400 please do. I  am being a little funny. The truth is $5  $10  $25  $54 - any and every  amount counts. This is the one campaign that fuels Invisible People  throughout the year and we desperately need your support to help end  homelessness.  Thank you in advance for your time and support ,HER,video

Christine works at McDonalds overnight and her daughter works there during the day. They are working homeless: living in a weekly rate hotel and splitting shifts so one of them is there to take care of the younger children.  It's a vicious cycle.  Minimum wage does not allow them enough money to afford first and last months rent to move out of the hotel  nor does it allow for them to afford babysitters.   If they stop working or get sick  they end up on the streets or a homeless shelter. 5 people living in one small hotel room is now the new American Dream because in many ways... it's now the new middle class!  If you haven't noticed watching the videos on this site  the interviews that mess me up the most you can tell by the space between my questions. Plus  that I just can't concentrate enough to ask questions. This story messed me up and I almost forget to ask Christine about her 3 wishes. My heart goes out to every family trying to survive in poverty. I wish I could simply take all their pain away.  Special thanks to Paul Kruse http://firststepbackhome.net,HER,video

Tammy has been "jumped" twice by kids and adults going on a rampage setting fires and abusing homeless people  but that's not the least of her worries. She has lived in the tent you see behind her for a few years and soon the city will be bulldozing the land because of new construction.   For Tammy  even with the dangers she feels safer living in a tent community than at a shelter.  She calls the community her family and in many ways they become one.   I was with an outreach team in Columbus  Ohio checking on all the "campers" to see if everyone had any needs and to place people on a housing list. Their goal is to get everyone the support they need before the tent community is eradicated.  I hope and pray Tammy makes it into a housing program.

Imagine working all your life and then in your senior years the only option for retirement is living in a park. When we recorded this interview   Dennis was a few months shy of turning 60 years-old and had been experiencing homelessness for a little less than 5 months.   Dennis said  "I used to make fun of the homeless until I became one"  which should stand out as a reminder to all of us that homelessness can happen to anyone.   A divorce changed his living situation. Dennis then developed health issues and stayed in a board and care until the high cost forced him to transition to a winter shelter program. When the winter shelter closed  Dennis had no other options except to sleep outside.   We have a "Silver Tsunami" coming.  Boomer generation is now entering into what should be their comfortable retirement years. Instead  because this last recession wiped out a lot more than hopes and dreams  seniors will enter into homelessness at an alarming rate.    Distributed by OneLoad.com,HER,video

After returning from tours of Iraq and Afghanistan  Michael found himself back in America with a drug and alcohol addiction  which quickly led to job loss and then homelessness.   Michael is homeless in Syracuse "flying a sign" on a subzero winter day just to get a few dollars to survive. Weather report at the time of this interview was around minus 15 °F. I had to take my gloves off just for a moment to setup the camera  and the tips of my fingers burned like they were on fire for the next half hour. Michael said he had been standing there for two hours. Luckily  Catholic Charities is providing shelter for him at night  but the day before on the same corner I gave socks and gloves to a man who is sleeping outside during this weather.    When I asked Michael what he wanted the world to know about being a homeless veteran he responded: " for a person to be homeless it's a shame  for a veteran to be homeless it's a tragedy."

Jonahlisa is a homeless youth in New York City. She says there are times you just want to break down and give up.   Jonahlisa says she has been homeless most of her life. At 2  her mother placed her in foster care and she then bounced from placement to placement. Jonahlisa experienced her first night of street homelessness at 9 years-old. To me  just the thought of any child that young on the streets messes me up.   The good news is Jonahlisa is a Covenant House  one of my favorite youth programs. Jonahlisa now has a job  and thanks to a program run by Jonahlisa- she will soon have her own apartment and will be going to school.     Special thanks to Hanes and Covenant House       .

Tear-Jerking Time-Lapse Video Shows Homeless Veteran's Incredible Transformation http://huff.to/1aI9R50,HER,link
This video you MUST watch to the end. Normally  after I ask someone for their 3 wishes - we end. But Brion didn't want any wishes  and when he started to explain why  he opened up about his childhood and growing up in foster care.   Brion got back from the army after being discharged for health reasons. His mom asked him for his money so she could buy drugs. When Brion said no  his mother went to the police to have him removed from her apartment.   Brion is a homeless youth in Pittsburgh. Some nights it was safer to stay up all night then to fall asleep and become vulnerable.    At around 3 minutes in to this video Brion shares candidly about the problem of putting a child into different foster care placements. Brion was placed into his first foster home at 9  and says he was in 13 placements until he aged out at 18. Now at age 20  Brion says everyone who grows up with that much inconsistency becomes a product of the "system"!  Sadly  Brion's story is very common. According to California Progress Report  65% of youth in foster care emancipate without a place to live. 40% of persons living in homeless shelters are former foster children. A similarly disproportionate percentage of the nation’s prison population is comprised of former foster youth. Less than 3% go to college and 51% are unemployed.  The good news is that although the story of a broken foster care system is common  young men like Brion are not. I cannot predict the future  but I can almost guarantee Brion is going to put all the madness behind him and have an amazing life!

WARNING: This video will mess you up!   Being on a road trip focusing on homeless youth it was important to tell the story of the homelessness you don't see - the millions of American families living in weekly rate hotels just barley one step from street homelessness. In fact  when I met this wonderful family today  they were packing up to leave and live in their car. The hotel had given them one day's grace  but they were completely out of money with no place to go. I am still emotional thinking about it even hours later. Truth is  thousands upon thousands of families face being evicted from a hotel to the streets every single day! This family was lucky. I tweet out what I call a "Hail Mary" and a generous heart stepped up and donated a weeks stay. That too messed me up!   Michael  Danielle  and their six children live in one hotel room near St Louis. Michael works a full time job  and they used to rent a house  but their landlord didn't pay the mortgage. After the bank took the property back  Michael  Danielle  and their six children were evicted with no place to go.   Hotel homelessness becomes a trap. Hotel's cost more than an apartment  but you can move right in without deposit  and a hotel room is far better than the streets. Once in  people who are considered the working poor  have an impossible time trying to save up enough money to afford adequate housing. Often these hotels are not a good place for kids to grow up.   There is a lot of emotion in this video. I get messed up throughout  but when the parents start talking about having to run in to the bathroom to cry so the kids don't see - I'm done! I am pissed that families have to live like this and heartbroken because I can literally feel their pain. I don't speak about this much  but I was raised by my mother and we went through some hard years when I was young.   If I could get you to watch just one video all the way to the end  and then share  this would be that video. This family is filled with strength and love  and has the courage to share their very real story about the homeless you don't see  but need to see!   Huge thanks to the generous donor who helped pay for another week's hotel for this family.

Nearly three years ago I took a big risk and drove up to Sacramento to help empower our homeless friends after watching the circus created by Oprah. At the time  I was nineteen months unemployed. InvisiblePeople.tv just started  and driving around with a camera seemed like a dumb idea. But I took the last little bit of money I had and headed north.  Also around three years ago  homeless activists in Sacramento started a campaign to acquire "safe ground" for campers to call home. It's been a battle  but our friends at Safe Ground [http://twitter.com/#!/SafeGroundSac] have won a few court cased and they continue to fight for homeless people in Sacramento.  Today I visited Safe Ground and was walking around meeting new friends. Over the hill a man was watching us. Robert walked down the hill and asked to be interviewed. I am so honored he did.  Please watch and listen to Robert's story. It's very powerful  and shows the pain and frustration these gorgeous people have to face every day. They don't want to live there  they just don't have anywhere else to go.

(Homeless) Woman set on fire at Van Nuys bus stop in critical condition http://ow.ly/goqg2,LER,link
This is the homeless you don't see but need to see. I met Marlo in a weekly rate hotel in Albuquerque  New Mexico. The whole family  two adults and four children  live in a small hotel room.  Marlo says there are days she does not even want to wake up. From hotel to hotel then shelter to hotel and back. Families with low and no income get caught in a vicious cycle of nonstop crisis.  One thing Marlo says in this interview I hope you hear loud and clear. She is trying to potty train her youngest kids early because diapers are so expensive. My friend Lisa who founded Help a Mother Out [helpamotherout.org] educated me on how social assistance doesn't pay for diapers. Later when I started working with homeless families I saw first-hand how badly low-income families need diapers. Marlo mentions she was almost arrested for panhandling trying to get diapers for her children. Please support your local diaper bank and the Diaper Act [http://helpamotherout.org/diaperact]  Special thanks to Joy Junction [http://joyjunction.org]  // more stories http://invisiblepeople.tv // follow http://twitter.com/invisiblepeople // follow http://twitter.com/hardlynormal,HER,video
