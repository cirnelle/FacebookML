We apologize but unfortunately our ordering system that we use automatically cancels orders placed with foreign credit cards and shipping or billing address based out of the US. Your order took a little longer to trigger cancellation due to the fact your requested shipping address was based in the United States.

Nice one  Julie Cooper. Sounds like a wedding vow. ,LER,status
Hey Pamela   You should be able to save it both as a widget on your Facebook page or in a separate page.  After you put in the music and sounds  name the mix and click the word "save". From there you can either click "Go to Mix" or the "Facebook Your Mix" button just below.   I hope that helps.   Happy Mixing  The Skittles team,LER,status
Woo hoo! 100 000 fans in just under 2 months! Thanks for stopping by everyone. We've got more good stuff to come so stay tuned. ,LER,status
Noor  so are you saying you like Sour Skittles? Call it a hunch. ,LER,status
There seems to be a lot of love in the air. Its like spring on the Skittles board. ,LER,status
Laurie  as George McFly would say  it was your density. I mean destiny. ,LER,status
Sorry to hear that Michael. Maybe they were basking in the tropical sunlight of St. Kitts for too long. We'll have a word with them about it.  ,LER,status
Hey Quila  We'll try it out. In the meantime  mix up a lemon and strawberry and let us know if that comes close to pink lemonade.,LER,status
Kevin  Dictionary.com defines Skittles as "ninepins in which a wooden ball or disk is used to knock down the pins." We don't know anything about that. Your definition is much nicer. Maybe that should be the Urban Dictionary definition instead. ,LER,status
Hey Cheri  we always believed that love came in cutting them by 1/8. ,LER,status
Thanks Jessica. We'll break that out at the next company softball game. ,LER,status
Thanks Rhea. Although now Skittles literally rocks. Check out Mix the Rainbow and make your own beats. ,LER,status
Maria   As Tina Turner would say  "Better than all the rest." ,LER,status
Thank Dimitri  We like to hope they bring more than that together  but its a good start. ,LER,status
Anya  We're honored. Maybe you should give Skittles a playmate named Sour Skittles. ,LER,status
Bongi  We'd love to hear your beats. You should post your mix in the discussion board. ,LER,status
Ashley  no lemonade yet  but maybe a handful of sour lemon skittles would do the trick instead. ,LER,status
Chris  just enact the 5 second rule. We won't tell if you want to extend that by a few hours.  ,LER,status
Hey everyone   Check out Mix the Rainbow above. Just click and drag the Skittles to make your own track. The amazing beatboxing is from Kenny Muhammad - “The Human Orchestra.” We wanna hear some of the most creative  unique  and fresh tracks so don’t forget to post your mix to your page and send it to friends.   Have fun.  ,LER,status
Marc  hopefully you were able to use Skittles not only for your hunger in the well  but as some sort of rescue device. Like to signal a giant falcon overhead that could pull you to safety.,LER,status
Indeed there are Brogan. Just don't go hitting any pinatas looking for them:  http://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=24332982952,LER,status
Not sure what dialect some of you are writing in  but we'll take it. Thanks for your comments. Kittles lubbs nu too.  ,LER,status
Muchas Gracias  Andres. ,LER,status
Thanks Beau. Better than bon bons? Peg Bundy would disagree  but we won't.  ,LER,status

“Our Hommage cars not only demonstrate how proud we are of our heritage  but also how important the past can be in determining our future.” – Adrian van Hooydonk  Senior Vice President BMW Group Design.,HER,photo
Another story about a special relationship between a BMW and its owner: Love knows no age. When the 19-year-old student Matyáš Homola (https://instagram.com/matyashomola/) bought his first car  it was obviously a hard decision as to what model to choose. But despite the fact he has always been into motorsports  he didn't opt for a new car. He is now the proud owner of a 1978 BMW 3 Series  so his car is two times older than him. Lovingly  he named his 3 Series „Colette“ and takes great care in maintaining the classic soul of the car - he even has plans for exhibitions and some rally competitions. We are quite sure  this couple will have a great future together. #BMWstories #legends,HER,photo

We need your help  You may have heard that there’s a safety issue with six models of our Top Loader washing machines made between 2010 - 2013. In rare cases  this issue could cause smoke and in some cases fire to come from the machine. We first commenced the recall in April 2013 but there are still thousands of affected machines that are yet to be serviced.  All it takes to fix an affected machine is a quick  free service from one of our qualified technicians.  We need your help to ensure that other Australians – your family  your friends  your neighbours - remain safe and well.  Here’s how you can help. Firstly check your own machine. Get your parents to check their machines. Get your mates to check their machines. Get your neighbours to check their machines. Get anyone you know who has a Samsung Top Loader to check their machines.  What do you need to do!  Check if you have one of the impacted models – the model name is on the back of the machine.  The impacted models are: SW75V9WIP/XSA SW80SPWIP/XSA SW65V9WIP/XSA WA85GWGIP/XSA SW70SPWIP/XSA WA85GWWIP/XSA  If you have one of the affected models you need to get in touch with our Product Safety team.  You can call them on 1800 239 655  8am – 8pm  7 days or visit our website and lodge you details on our dedicated product safety page http://bit.ly/1HQTdkl,HER,photo
TOP LOAD WASHING MACHINE RECALL NOTICE:  Samsung takes product safety very seriously.  Samsung Electronics Australia is encouraging customers to check the model details of their Samsung washing machine  to determine if their model is impacted by the voluntary product safety recall initiated on the 30 April 2013.  Six top loader washing machines are affected - the model numbers are as follows:  • SW75V9WIP/XSA • SW65V9WIP/XSA • SW70SPWIP/XSA • SW80SPWIP/XSA • WA85GWGIP/XSA • WA85GWWIP/XSA  We identified a potentially hazardous issue affecting these six models that can cause electrical smoking and/or  in some cases  fire when the machine machines are used.   If you own  rent  or know someone that may have one of these affected machines  we encourage you to please contact Samsung as soon as possible for a FREE in-home safety check and service which will fix the product safety issue.   Contact Samsung's Product Safety Hotline on 1800 239 655 or email wm.samsung@samsung.com to arrange a FREE in-home service with a technician.
