BREAKING: A BABY ELEPHANT HAS JUST DIED AT RINGLING'S TRAINING FACILITY.    Mike was only 2 years old. This young elephant's sad death is no surprise given that four other baby elephants have died under Ringling's watch  including one 8-month-old whose hind legs were shattered during circus training & a 3-year-old who drowned in a pond while trying to get away from a trainer with a bullhook—a weapon that resembles a fireplace poker with a sharp steel hook on one end.   Ringling still uses these weapons at its Florida compound  where elephants are separated from their mothers shortly after birth & beaten into submission & elephants are chained on concrete for many hours each day.   These stressful conditions have been linked to the highly fatal disease that killed this calf  which disproportionately impacts captive baby elephants  yet Ringling continues to breed more babies for a life in chains. These deaths are precisely why PETA is calling for an end to Ringling's breeding program & for all of these elephants to be retired to a proper accredited sanctuary.,HER,photo

BREAKING: An orca has just died at SeaWorld San Antonio.   Unna is the 38th orca used by SeaWorld to die far short of how long she was expected to live  though it is in fact hard to call it 'living' when her 'life' consisted of being taken away from her mother just before her sixth birthday  being impregnated when she was only 8 years old & giving birth to a stillborn orca  & being so deprived of enrichment & the ability to engage in natural behavior that she obsessively picked at the paint on the bottom of SeaWorld's show pool floor until her face became badly injured  says PETA Foundation Wildlife Veterinarian Dr. Heather Rally.   While the infection that killed this orca is common in captivity  there is no evidence to suggest that the same is true of orcas in nature. PETA is calling on SeaWorld to stop sentencing orcas to miserable lives of deprivation in dismal tanks & start building coastal sanctuaries. Thirty-eight dead orcas is 38 too many.  R.I.P.

Swaziland is one of the five countries with the highest HIV rates in the world. The current national adult prevalence rate of HIV infection is 33%  and the HIV prevalence rate among pregnant women rose from 4% in 1992  to 43% in 2004.  Despite these extreme circumstances  Swaziland’s Global Fund-financed HIV/AIDS program has achieved impressive results since its inception in August 2003.  In Swaziland  (RED) money is supporting Global Fund-financed programs  which have already:      * reached over 4 400 mothers with services to prevent mother-to-child-transmission of HIV     * trained over 150 midwives and doctors in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV     * equipped over 40 hospitals to provide services to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV     * reached over 140 000 people with voluntary counseling and testing for prevention of HIV     * trained over 70 counselors to teach prevention of HIV     * set up over 35 counseling and testing centers for prevention of HIV     * established feeding schemes in 335 schools     * built 154 community feeding centers     * provided education support for over 36 000 vulnerable children     * provided anti-retroviral therapy for HIV/AIDS to almost 15 000 patients     * trained over 3 000 health workers to deliver home-based care for patients with HIV/AIDS  In the next two to three years  these programs aim to increase four-fold the number of women receiving treatment to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV  to offer comprehensive support for orphans and to more than double the number of people currently on antiretroviral therapy.  See how (RED) money is helping The Global Fund fight the pandemic.,LER,video

Please join WWP in honoring former Staff Sgt. Ryan Pitts  the ninth recipient of the Medal of Honor  recognized for his combat actions during his service in Afghanistan.   The ceremony was held earlier today. Watch it here: http://bit.ly/1p8EbdH  On the morning of July 13  2008 at about 4 a.m.  Pitts was manning Observation Post Topside  which was positioned east of the main base  and east of a bazaar and hotel complex in Wanat  in the Waygal Valley.  Shortly after  soldiers conducting surveillance identified potential insurgents. They put together a request for fire. But before that could happen  at about 4:20 a.m  Soldiers heard machine-gun fire from the north. After that  the valley erupted in enemy fire.  Soldiers at OP Topside were hit with small arms fire  rocket-propelled grenades and hand grenades. Pitts and six other paratroopers at OP Topside were injured in the initial volley of enemy fire. Two paratroopers were killed. Pitts took grenade shrapnel in both legs and his left arm.  For more than an hour after  Pitts continued to fight and defend his position and his teammates  despite his injuries.  Throughout the battle  despite the loss of blood and severity of his wounds  Pitts' incredible toughness  determination  and ability to communicate with leadership while under fire allowed U.S. forces to hold the observation post and turn the tide of the battle.  Without his ability to stay alert and fight while critically wounded  the enemy would have gained a foothold on high ground and inflicted significantly greater causalities onto the vehicle patrol base  and the enemy could have been in possession of the fallen Soldiers at the observation post.  Nine Soldiers -- Spc. Sergio Abad  Cpl. Jonathan Ayers  Cpl. Jason Bogar  1st Lt. Jonathan Brostrom  Sgt. Israel Garcia  Cpl. Jason Hovater  Cpl. Matthew Phillips  Cpl. Pruitt Rainey  and Cpl. Gunnar Zwilling -- were killed in the battle.,HER,photo

These wounded veterans bear both the visible and invisible wounds of wars from burns and amputations  traumatic brain injuries and paralysis to combat stress  post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. These warriors have already sacrificed so much  it is unfathomable and unacceptable to ask them to bear any further burdens.

The Wounded Warrior Project family is deeply saddened by the sudden passing of J. T. Townsend.  J.T. lit up a room with his positive energy and outlook on life. Through the J.T. Townsend Foundation he inspired and touched the lives of thousands.  J.T. saw his own spinal cord injury and paralysis as an opportunity to help others  and never wavered in his determination to improve the lives of individuals living with disabilities. J.T was selfless  always giving and using his personal story for good in the community.   We are grateful for the time we had with J.T. as he completed his studies at University of North Florida with an internship in our Jacksonville  FL office.    J.T’s smile and laugh inspired us and we know his beautiful spirit will continue to make a difference in the lives of many more.   Our thoughts and prayers go out to J.T.’s family and friends.

This trip has helped Eric fulfill his lifelong dream of a cross-country hunt; a dream that initially seemed impossible after his severe traumatic brain injury in Iraq.   On this adventure  Eric hunted ten different animals (alligator  Sitka deer  wild boar  Axis deer  buffalo  Merino ram  Pronghorn antelope  bear  Whitetail deer  and elk). A film crew tagged along to film the adventure for Trophy Quest on The Outdoor Channel (airing starting 11/21) and Beyond the Battlefield on the Sportsman’s Channel and CSS Sports (airing starting 12/28). Through these shows  others will have the opportunity to see Eric's inspiring adventure  too!  Please join us in congratulating Eric on his unwavering pursuit of his dreams!,LER,photo

Reason #4 to give today: You can help men  women  and children rebuild their lives after they’ve courageously escaped from the LRA. Your #GivingTuesday donation will fund our work with community partners in the Central African Republic who provide immediate assistance  trauma healing support  and vocational training to former LRA abductees.,LER,link
Reason #3 to give today: Helping LRA abductees escape is only part of the equation. It’s also vital that we educate & train our community partners in DRC and CAR on how to safely receive and support the men  women  and children who are returning home.,LER,link
Reason #2 to give today: We are empowering communities and peacefully dismantling the LRA from within by working with local journalists in DRC and CAR to create & broadcast “Come Home” radio messages. These messages have been proven to give Kony’s fighters the courage and instructions they need to safely escape the LRA.  You can fund these lifesaving messages by donating to our #GivingTuesday fundraising campaign. All donations made today will be matched by a generous donor and have DOUBLE the impact.  https://give.invisiblechildren.com/events/givingtuesday-2015/e64297,LER,link
Reason #1 to give today: On a recent trip to central Africa  Ananda met this 4 year old elephant named Charles. He was orphaned at a very young age when both of his parents were killed by poachers.

From Ananda: I woke up early yesterday morning to watch Joannick  our Early Warning Network Hub Operator in Central African Republic (CAR)  conduct the first of two daily security check-ins with communities across CAR.   The reality that this Network is a lifeline for hundreds of thousands of people targeted by LRA violence hit me like a slap in the face. I listened anxiously as each community  one by one  either reported that all was well  or that there had been an LRA sighting or attack in their area since the previous day's check in. For most of these communities  the Early Warning Network is their only way of letting neighboring towns and the outside world know if they've been attacked.,LER,video

A message from our President and CEO  Lisa Dougan  on the five-year anniversary of the passing of our beloved friend and colleague  Nate Henn:  "Five years ago today  the world lost a true hero  a gentle giant  and a deeply loved son  brother  and friend. On behalf of Invisible Children  and with a heavy heart  I celebrate the life of Nate Henn  a fallen peacemaker and a beloved member of the Invisible Children family who was tragically killed in the 2010 World Cup bombings in Kampala  Uganda.  Our love  our gratitude for Nate  and our wishes for peace and comfort go out to the Henn Family. While being honest in their grief  the Henn Family has continued to be such an incredible example of courage  resilience  and grace to all of us. Their embodiment of Nate's legacy and their steadfast commitment to the mission of Invisible Children continues to inspire and astound us.  I vividly remember the last personal communication I had with Nate before his life was tragically taken. On the evening of May 24  2010  I received the most joyful  exuberant text message from Nate. It came just hours after I had the privilege of representing Invisible Children  along with Ben and Jason  at the White House when President Obama signed the LRA Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act into law. Nate was beyond ecstatic about the historic victory -- one that he had worked so hard for  along with hundreds of thousands of other young Americans  and dozens of Uganda friends who had joined him as Invisible Children roadies in 2010.  There is no way to adequately express Nate's commitment to peace for LRA-affected communities  and his love for his friends in northern Uganda. While my heart aches on days like today  I'm also deeply and inexplicably thankful for the gift of knowing Nate and his friendship  and that my last exchange with Nate took place on such a special day that embodied the work of peace that he wholeheartedly gave himself to.  Today  I am reminded and challenged to be conduit of Nate's life and legacy -- to remain committed to the work of peace  to bridging cultural and geographic divides through friendship  and to living joyfully and with laughter as Nate did every single day.  I am actually writing this from central Africa where I will be spending the next few weeks with Invisible Children's teams and community partners in DRC and CAR. I could not think of anything more inspiring or motivating to continue the work of seeing an end to LRA violence than the combination of Nate's life of love  paired with the courage  resilience  and dedication of our staff and community partners in central Africa.  I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that Nate would stop at nothing to see peace in central Africa  and communities free from violence. I hope I can live with even a fraction of Nate's courage  love  and determination to see this mission through to the end....and to have fun while doing it.  I love you  Nate.  I love you  Henn Family.  I love you  Invisible Children Community.  Blessed are the peacemakers.",LER,status

“Spike your best friend’s eggnog when they’re not looking.”  Bloomingdale's ran this inappropriate ad that suggests date rape in their holiday catalog  clearly showing the man looking at the woman as she's turned away distracted.

This little girl is smarter than a lot of adults. Meet Maggie  she's seven and saw this sign in her local store.  It upset her right away  she's a big superhero fan. Her mom says in an interview to Buzzfeed that Maggie saw the sign before she did and said something like: “Well that’s wrong! Anybody can like superheroes  they’re being stupid aren’t they?”  The store has since apologized saying: “This alarm clock would make a great gift for both girls and boys. The sign has been removed and we’re sorry if it caused any confusion.”  Best line from the BuzzFeed article is this one: "Fortunately it doesn’t seem to have put her off - as well as superheroes she loves Doctor Who  Minecraft  dragons  skeletons and zombies (she had a cemetery cake for her birthday!) but also likes Frozen  princesses  kittens etc. She just thinks shops labelliing toys for boys or girls is silly: “I can like what I want.”  You're awesome Maggie!,HER,photo

Meet Turia Pitt  this is an extraordinary woman you should know.  Less than three years ago doctors said the ultra-marathon runner wouldn't live to see another day after she was caught in a bush fire and suffered burns to 65% of her body.  Turia spent 864 days in hospital  went through over a 100 surgeries and had fingers amputated. Then the woman who ran marathons had to learn to walk again.  Turia is amazing  in the past six months alone she rode her bike from Sydney to Uluru  swam a 20 kilometre race in Western Australia and walked the Great Wall of China.

Watch: LIFE IS SACRED at the Human Rights Watch Film Festival!   Do you know the story of Antanas Mockus? See the inspiring doc about his life  June 18th & 20th IFC Center & Film Society of Lincoln Center http://bit.ly/1JwQ60d  Violence is part of everyday life in #Colombia  where the military  guerrillas  paramilitaries  and drug cartels have been fighting for decades  and hundreds of thousands of people have been killed. But the unorthodox presidential candidate Antanas Mockus and his enthusiastic young activist supporters attempt to reverse the vicious cycle with an imaginative and positive election campaign. As mayor of Bogotá  dressed in a Superman costume and with an indomitable trust in the good of his fellow citizens  he took on towering crime rates and people's bad traffic habits. Can good ideas and an idealistic drive alone change a political culture where violence is rampant? This is the portrait of an inspiring man and a powerful youth movement  whose stories are relevant far beyond Colombia's borders.,LER,video

Tune in! The creators of THE TRIALS OF SPRING  an incredible project which will be shown as both a feature documentary and a multimedia presentation this week at HRWFF - New York  will be interviewed live on HuffPost Live today at 3:30PM EST!  Director. Gini Reticker and exec. producer Abigail Disney will be interviewed by Alyona Minkovski: http://live.huffingtonpost.com/  Women were on the front lines of the uprisings that swept the Arab world in 2011. Young and old  rich and poor  veiled and unveiled  they took to the streets beside men  their signs held high or hands cupped around their mouths to amplify their voices. But as the jubilation of revolution gave way to the convoluted process of governing—and often the chaos and blood of war—women disappeared from the mainstream story. Behind the scenes  however  they continue to play vital roles—keeping schools open and mouths fed  tending to the sick and injured  keeping the world informed through blogs and social media  lobbying for human rights  running for office  building alliances  even drafting constitutions for fledgling democracies. The Trials of Spring is a multimedia initiative that aims to elevate the stories of these women.,LER,photo

În cazul în care nu va exista o anchetă penală  pot fi cel puţin adoptate politici care să facă reapariţia torturii mai puţin probabilă. CIA  cu tradiţia sa de secretomanie şi lipsa asumării publice  ar trebui să nu mai reţină suspecţi  lăsând astfel de treburi în seama Departamentului de Justiţie. Când suspecţii sunt reţinuţi pentru interogare  Comitetul Internaţional al Crucii Roşii ar trebui să aibă acces imediat şi regulat  fără nicio excepţie. Cu tradiţia sa de confidenţialitate  acesta nu ar pune în pericol investigaţii delicate  în timp ce prezenţa sa ar descuraja orice tentativă de tortură.

Camera traps play a critical role in monitoring snow leopards and other wildlife. WWF works with local herders like Byambatsooj to monitor rare species and work to protect them.

Elephants live in a matriarchal society  so other females in the social group help a calf to its feet after birth and show the baby how to nurse. The older elephants adjust the pace of the herd so the calf can keep stride. By watching the adults  the calf learns which plants to eat and how to access them. The females regularly make affectionate contact with the calf.  Send your Mom this image as an e-card: http://wwf.to/12gg3cC,HER,photo

Earlier this month in Bangkok  178 nations convened to discuss global wildlife trade and many of the country delegates publicly expressed urgency and seriousness of the crisis. As poaching rates for African elephants and rhinos soar to catastrophic heights  member nations of the UN Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) took action.  The international community provided greater protections for rhinos. And thanks to many of you  the Thai prime minister said her country will shut down the unregulated ivory trade in the country to save elephants.

More sad wildlife crime news: Poaching statistics released by the South African government reveal 668 rhinos were slaughtered in 2012—a record high and a 50% increase over 2011.

The horn is also seen as a highly desirable status symbol in some Asian countries  notably Vietnam.

Did you know that despite their fearsome reputation as ruthless predators  sharks are much more likely to be killed by humans than the other way around? Some species  such as this porbeagle  are targeted primarily for their meat. However the growing trade in shark fins - often used to make an expensive Asian soup - has become a serious threat to many shark species. Sharks are caught  the fins are cut off and the rest of the shark is thrown back into the sea. As many as an estimated 73 million sharks are killed every year  primarily for their fins.    Despite living in cold waters  the porbeagle is a very fast swimmer  closely related to great white sharks. They have the ability to thermoregulate and therefore raise their body temperatures higher than the surrounding water.,HER,photo

“Almost all of the models were from local Portland  OR rescues. Before doing the actual shake photo we would get a nice head shot for the rescue to post on their website.

“For a majority of the book  I shot with Nikon D4s which shoots at a very rapid frame rate  I only have a few seconds to capture these images so every frame counts! I used Paul Buff Einsteins on set for lighting. I always keep a bunch in my studio because they are easy to bring on location and do a great job of freezing motion.” - Carli Davidson Pet Photography  As a special thanks to our fans  we're giving away eight (8) copies of 'Shake Cats' from award-winning photographer Carli Davidson.

“Getting the cats to shake was actually more of a grooming process than a waiting game. We basically treated the shoot like a mini grooming session with lots of treats and cat cuddles. I had my assistants  Amanda Giese and Tanya Paul  who are also professional animal care technicians  on site to do nail trims and ear cleanings. The ear cleanings are what generally caused the shake to happen  I just had to be ready.” - Carli Davidson Pet Photography  As a special thanks to our fans  we're giving away eight (8) copies of 'Shake Cats' from award-winning photographer Carli Davidson.

BREAKING NEWS: The cages of Barkworks pet store in Los Angeles’ Westside Pavillion mall are looking a little empty. That’s because the store--part of a southern California chain--is closing for good on Monday!  We believe this is due to pressure from the recently-passed L.A. City ordinance banning the sale of mill-bred pets. Additionally  our amazing volunteers have invested hundreds of hours over four years peacefully educating the public every weekend at this and other Barkworks locations about the fact that Barkworks is supplied by cruel puppy mills.  It's an incredibly gratifying way to the end the year with a huge win for animal welfare. And if this can happen at one of America's most popular malls  it can happen anywhere! -jessie  Update per your questions: For more information on puppy mills and what you can do to stop them  check out this link on our website: http://bit.ly/TnUDZc. You might also be interested in this story from KTLA a couple of years ago on puppy mills and stores like Barkworks:http://youtu.be/lEII7ZitTYE.  This store made a business decision to close.

We have had more people sign the Obama Family Dog petition than we could ever have imagined. It shows clearly just how many Americans believe in adoption! We must continue to forge ahead until we hear from the Obamas themselves  and in the meantime we can continue to talk about the benefits of adoption.  With the buzz this campaign has caused  we have maybe one of the largest stages ever to let people know what an amazing thing it is to save a life.  Please click Flickr link below to tell the world about your animals  and the bond you share.  http://www.flickr.com/groups/americasadoptedpets/  If you have yet to sign the petition  follow this link!  http://network.bestfriends.org/Petitions/Detail.aspx?pn=9&g=330dbd95104f4f589f58dcfc97e355f6 ,LER,status
Hi Trish   The Obamas HAVE said they are getting a dog after the election win or lose. It's a deal Sen. Obama made with his daughters.  If he ran for President  they could get a dog.  Of course we would never encourage a family to bring an animal into their lives if they were not ready. We would like to encourage them  and everyone to adopt once they decide they are ready.,LER,status
On Sunday  the Best Friends Rapid Response team  on the water in Oakville  Iowa  rescued a cat from a precarious spot.  The adult children of the cat’s person  worried about George  had contacted the Best Friends team asking for help. So the team motored in their boat to the home  which had about a foot of water inside. The Best Friends crew sloshed around  searching through each room and each closet. But … no George.  Then they reached the kitchen  where there are lots of places to hide. Ethan Gurney began opening cupboards and  sure enough  there was George  hiding in one. “He’s looking a little grumpy  but not too bad ” Ethan said as he lifted George out of the cupboard. (George was later reunited with his grateful person.),LER,video
After spending 10 long hours on the Iowa River on Thursday  the Best Friends Rapid Response team was called to the scene of a cat stuck in a tree surrounded by high waters.  So that night  Rapid Response manager Rich Crook and first responder Ethan Gurney got back in their flat-bottomed boat and motored back out to Oakville – for one last run of the day.  As they moved upstream and neared a long row of trees  Ethan began to whistle. That’s when the cat started meowing. “Sure enough ” Rich says  “there was the cat  in a tree.”,LER,video

Last year  NFL star Michael Vick made national headlines for his involvement in a large  very well organized dog fighting ring. As the legal process unfolded  Best Friends Animal Society made the case that the dogs were the victims  and they did not deserve to die like so many others have. The dogs arrived here at the Sanctuary in early 2008  and it has been clear from the start that these dogs did deserve a second chance. It is hoped that their story can help change perceptions of the dogs that come from fighting backgrounds.,LER,video

Prayer Point: They came to his home and told him  “If you say ‘Allah Akbar’ and commit to Islam  we will not take your money and your home.” “I cannot leave my religion ” Paul* said. So jihadists from ISIS took his money and his valuables  leaving him with just the clothes he was wearing. He joined thousands of other Christians in fleeing Mosul  also known as Nineveh plains.  The roads became so crowded with displaced families that a typical one-hour ride became a nine-hour test of endurance to reach Erbil. As these persecuted Christians and other religious minorities flooded into Erbil  they sought shelter any place they could- churches  schools  parks  unfinished buildings  even a mall. Samaritan’s Purse responded by providing food  water  shoes  and more.  Two hundred tents were distributed to provide temporary shelter. Thousands of mattresses and pillows were given to displaced families. One hundred cradles were provided to protect babies from biting ants on the ground. In one 48-hour period we worked with our partner to feed 14 000 people. Bibles were also provided to those who had to leave theirs behind. As of September  well more than 1 million Iraqis have been forced to flee their homes this year due to violence. Samaritan’s Purse continues to provide critical aid in Jesus’ Name to Christians and other displaced groups in the country as they simply try to survive another day.   Please pray for an end to the violence in Iraq and Syria. For many to be saved through the work of Samaritan’s Purse and our partners in the Middle East.

“We were scared  it was windy in the sea and the boat's motor stopped working."  New footage from this morning: Children and a baby were among this group of 44 refugees and migrants  rescued from an overloaded dinghy struggling to float in the high seas  off of Lesvos  Greece. Greek coastguards - who are currently rescuing up to three boats a night - moved swiftly to save the exhausted group of mainly Syrians and Afghans from a failing boat meant to carry just 25 people.  Bassam  from Syria told us: “We didn’t choose to be refugees  put our life in danger  especially with my young boy  I love him so much. When I decided to bring him  risk his life  it is because there was a strong reason to do that.

Our colleague Bathoul met her in a Syrian refugee camp in Erbil  in the Kurdistan region in northern Iraq. Bathoul said:  "Stories like Amy's break my heart. Not only were her dreams shattered  but the realisation that you might not be able to achieve them because you do not have the opportunity is a bitter pill to swallow.   51% of Syrian refugees are women. Many of them young girls like Amy who live in limbo waiting for an opportunity  a chance or a glimmer of hope that all is not lost and there is a still a chance to change their lives."  Saying goodbye  Amy said: "It was nice to meet you Bathoul. I enjoyed talking to you. You are very lucky to have finished your education and to be doing what you love. I would really love to work  just like you are now."  Photo: UNHCR/B.Ahmed,HER,photo

We often fail to recognize the real heroes of this world which makes this message even more special. Today  we are honoured to announce that “Mama” Hawa Aden Mohamed  a true hero  is the recipient of this year’s Nansen Refugee Award. She has assisted more than 215 000 people in Somalia – mainly displaced women and girls – survivors of violence – to recover  heal  and restart their lives.  “When Hawa Aden Mohamed rescues a displaced girl  a life is turned around ” said High Commissioner Guterres. “Today  we are saluting her for her work to save  nurture and educate hundreds of women and girls  many victims of the worst kind of violence.”  http://www.unhcr.org/nansen    © UNHCR/ F.

It's an extra treat when you think about all the aspects of the image and the reasons the photograph impresses you. The composition  the details  the lines  the light  the list goes on. Not to mention the complexity of the shot as well. To achieve this particular image  the photographer probably had to walk on quite a few slippery rock layers. Every visible and also concealed feature creates a pleasant viewing experience.,HER,photo

Dawn illuminates a view across Estancia Monte Dinero and the Atlantic Ocean  Rio Gallegos  Argentina.   Photo Credit: © Nick Hall  Editor's Note: All photographers should know that there are two times of the day when light is the most ideal for shooting astonishing images  in the morning or in the evening. Technically speaking during sunrise and sunset  the angle between the sun and the earth's surface is the smallest which enables the sunlight to breeze over the landscape and subject in a manner that highlights the beautiful details of nature and also creates great shadows.  In this specific image  the shadows are especially delightful.,HER,photo

Helecho enano along the hiking trail "Los Colmillos de Chaihuin in Chile’s Valdivian Coastal Reserve (VCR).   Photo credit: © Erika Nortemann  Editor's Note: This is macro photography at its finest. This helecho enano or fern leaf is actually extremely small  but with the help of a macro lens makes this tiny structure look massive and gorgeous. The ambient  backlit light cooperates well with this macro technique and adds contrast and sharpness that accentuates the leaf's miniature details.

Color  tone  and line are generally considered to be the components of a painting; however  they apply to a photograph too. The way the sun cracks through the clouds offers a lovely tonal wonderland which softens the highland and soft terrain.This artist seems to have captured and grasped these elements charmingly.,HER,photo

An overcast river's edge in Yellowstone National Park.   Photo Credit: © Dylan Rorabaugh  Editor's Note: Shooting in overcast conditions can be troublesome for some photographers. If you expose for the sky  your product contains an under-exposed ground and if you expose for the ground  your product has a washed out sky. Neutral density graduated filters are great filters to use when shooting a bright overcast sky. These filters darken the sky while keeping the rest of the shot at the same exposure. So never fear  you can get out of this Catch-22 the same way this photographer did!,HER,photo

The long exposure has captured the motion in the water and in result has built a visually stunning environment to become absorbed in.,HER,photo

"My Name is Isabella  I live in Maryland and I go to Stedwick Elementary. I just finished first grade. My teacher read a story to me called "The Great Kapok Tree" and it made me want to help save the rain forest. I came home from school that day and made a sign to post on my front door asking neighbors to help donate to save the rain forest. My Mom told me that if I really wanted to I could earn money to help my cause. So I started doing chores around the house and talking to my friends and family about what I wanted to do. Over the last 4 months I have been able to earn $120.00. I donated my money to the nature conservancy's plant a billion trees project. I feel really great about what I was able to do to help save a forest."

Photo Editor's Choice of the week!   Buttermilk Clouds above Colorado River at Sorrel River Ranch in Utah.    Photo credit: © Tom Till   Editor's Note: Composition was deeply thought about when capturing this landscape.  The classic rule of thirds guided the photographer to fill the frame and capture leading lines  which ultimately added depth and exposed repetition.  The triangle that is formed from the clouds and their reflection in the river  frames the bright orange mountains and reinforces the sensible image structure. These natural patterns and shapes are truly intriguing.,HER,photo

A view of the Great Sand Dunes National Park from Medano Creek at night showing the night sky and stars  Colorado USA  Editor's Note: Long exposure photography can illustrate nature’s most beautiful and fascinating occurrences. So the longer the exposure  the longer the star streaks. This technique helps capture the motion of stars in the night sky due to the rotation of Earth. A high ISO and large aperture also contributes to illustrating this phenomenon. To top it all off  the photographer’s use of a wide-angle lens offers a wonderful perspective to a magnificent scene.

Late afternoon sunlight cascades through clouds onto the volcanic shores of Horseshoe Bay  Rinca Island  near Komodo  Indonesia  Indian Ocean.  Photo credit: © Ethan Daniels  Editor's Note: One of the most important elements of landscape photography is light. Dusk and dawn light especially translate landscapes with low contrast and add depth and complexity to images. At these times of the day the sun is lower in the sky as well as low angled so sunlight travels through more air.  In this particular image the shadows are elongated and act as fascinating graphic elements.,HER,photo

Morning light over the Colorado River at Dead Horse Point State Park in Utah.  Photo credit: © Tom Till  Editor's Note: Natural landscapes are a work of art in itself.

The morning light in this photo successfully illuminates every crevice  nook  and cranny. The right light can make the most out of textures  angles  and shadows.

Photo credit: © Nick Hall  Editor's Note: Vanishing points are one of the greatest elements used to create perspective in a work of art. Not only do they create an illusion of depth but they can also create mood. In this particular image the vanishing point creates a dismal feeling. Receding parallels enable a desolate  abandoned ambience. The hue and tone nicely combine everything together and highlight a quiet  calm sight.,HER,photo

So ... I officially started my training as part of TEAM RMHC for the Chicago Marathon this weekend. On Saturday  I thought I'd start with a bang - I was like  "I'm going to run 13 miles today!" BUT about 8 miles in I had to give up cause I was so dehydrated. I was really discouraged - thinking I'm never going to be able to do a marathon - but then I thought - I have to take SMALL steps towards my BIG goal! Just like our RMHC families going through a tough time - it's the small wins along the way that add up to victory! With each mile I run & with every dollar I raise - I'm fighting to bring hope & support to the families that we serve! If you want to run with me make sure to visit www.rmhc.org/chicagomarathon to learn more!,LER,link

Cecile Richards tells it like it is: "While our opponents have been working to create scandal and panic where none exists  doctors and nurses at Planned Parenthood health centers have continued to provide care to thousands of women  men and young people every day — contraception  cancer screenings  testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections (STIs)  and safe and legal abortion.

Happy 50th anniversary  legal birth control!   Today we're celebrating the June 7  1965 ruling of Griswold v. Connecticut  which said that married women have a right to privacy in how to plan their families. The case paved the way for full legalization of birth control for ALL women  as well as the right to an abortion and LGBT civil rights.   See how far we've come in expanding birth control access—and how far we still need to go: http://ppact.io/1G3NfZY.,HER,photo
Man  that's true!,HER,photo
#ThrowBackThursday: Think about what life was like for women before birth control became legal in 1965. Got that?

We're forever grateful to a woman by the name of Estelle Griswold. Don’t know her? You should. Her activism is a big reason that birth control became legal in 1965  and why millions of women have access to it today.,HER,link

BREAKING: President Obama just announced new rules limiting U.S. ivory sales!  If finalized  these new regulations would place a near-total ban on domestic ivory sales  imports  and exports of African elephant ivory.  More than 100 000 elephants were killed by poachers between 2010 and 2012  leading some scientists to predict that African forest elephants could be extinct within the decade. The United States is a significant market for ivory.  Following is a statement by NRDC President Rhea Suh: “The truth of the matter is that the United States plays a very real role in the slaughter of African elephants. Our trade and import of ivory is part of the demand that is driving the near-extermination of this species.  That’s why our country needs to do everything in its power to protect these endangered and iconic animals. “Restricting sales and helping to reduce demand is a critical part of the solution. Though we still have plenty of work to do to protect elephants for good  these new regulations take us one step closer.” #ivory #elephants #conservation,HER,photo

"What counts in life is not the mere fact that we have lived. It is what difference we have made to the lives of others that will determine the significance of the life we lead." — Nelson Mandela.   He will be missed. He made the difference in the lives of many  including those of the children in Africa who did not get the incurable and often crippling disease of #polio.  In 1996  some mainly Muslim African nations banned polio immunizations. Past RI President Herb Brown flew to South Africa to plead with that country's president  Nelson Mandela  for assistance.  Mandela called a press conference  with Brown at his side  and told the gathered reporters  "I am asking right now that the president of every country in Africa open their doors to allow Rotary  UNICEF  and WHO to make Africa polio-free. We in South Africa can already attest to the value of this program and South Africa is now polio-free. I ask that each president do the same for their children as we have done for ours."   Almost immediately  Africa once again put out the welcome mat for polio immunizations. In 1997  Nelson Mandela received the #Rotary Award for World Understanding. ,HER,link

Whoa!! We have panda twins. 🐼🐼 Pandas often give birth to twins  but are usually only able to care for one at a time. For this reason  the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute team have pulled the second cub and have placed it in an incubator. The "panda twin protocol" calls for each cub to have time to bond with its mother  so keepers will carefully swap each cub out from time to time.   This method has been used successfully in China for many years. National Zoo animal care staff have traveled to China in previous years to receive training in the twin raising method,HER,photo

Today  June 6  in 1944  Allied forces descended upon the beaches of Normandy  France in what is known as D-Day.  The D-Day invasion began with a dangerous attack by American paratroopers. Dropped behind enemy lines to soften up the German troops and to secure needed targets  the paratroopers knew that if the accompanying assault by sea failed -- there would be no rescue.  While nearly 7 000 Allied navy and merchant vessels pushed toward the beaches of Normandy  overhead  12 000 bombers and fighter planes poured inland. Their coordinated actions secured an Allied foothold in France that helped lead to the end of World War II.

Rookie (magazine) on how to find and create the best #selfcare routine and skills best suited for you! You are worthy of nurturing yourself and deserve relaxation! 💖  "No one can tell you what self-care skills will be best for you. Things like bubble baths work for lots of people because they’re warm and smell good and you can’t do work while bubbling it up  but don’t think that’s the only way to take care of yourself. The important thing to connect to when creating your own list of self-care skills is what your emotions were before you did the action and what they were after. This regulation isn’t an accident  but rather a deliberate action by you to help yourself."   http://www.rookiemag.com/2016/02/self-care/,LER,link

Areej Obeidat  a 26-year-old Jordanian nurse  has worked at the International Rescue Committee’s Mafraq clinic since it opened in June 2012. She sees close to 50 patients a day  all of them Syrian refugees. They come for primary care: Colds  coughs  high blood pressure and diarrhea are their most common complaints. Now and again  someone recovering from a bullet wound appears  looking to have a dressing changed.  For many of the patients  just the chance to talk can be therapeutic. “They’re often lonely ” says Areej. “They’ve lost family  friends  all that they know and care for. They frequently cry when I speak with them about their homes and family in Syria. They want so much to talk. I soon understood they’re not just here for medical support—emotional support is so important  too.”   This International Women’s Day  share this story as a tribute to everyday heroes like Areej  who provide care – and a listening ear – to those most in need.,HER,photo
Nyibol Akol Padiet  a 37-year-old community health provider  has been treating common childhood diseases in her village in South Sudan since receiving training from the IRC. “I have been doing this work since July 2009 and I still enjoy it ” she says.

Thankfully  in the three years that I have been working for the IRC  I haven’t experienced a death.”   Nyibol is proud of her work and the difference she makes in her community. “Through my volunteer work  children’s lives have been saved ” she says. “There are many poor people who cannot afford to buy medication. So  for the IRC to provide medicines free of charge  it’s such a relief for everyone. Access to these medicines means they don’t have to walk long distances to the nearest health center.”  This International Women’s Day  share this story as a tribute to everyday heroes like Nyibol  who - together with 1 600 other IRC-trained community health workers in South Sudan - have treated nearly 78 000 children in their communities.,HER,photo

The will to learn is a powerful thing.   Her entire life  Brigitte dreamt of the moment she would be able to spell her name. When she was a little girl  her parents separated and she was sent to live with an aunt to babysit her cousins. They all ended up going to school  but she was kept at home.   When she was 17  she moved to live with her husband. Although he knew how to read and write  he never taught his wife the alphabet.   When the International Rescue Committee started a program to teach young people in the Democratic Republic of Congo the basics of reading  writing and math  nothing would stop 28 year-old Brigitte from enrolling – not even the age limit of 25.    “We told her we could not take her  but she would just come and sit outside  in the sun  and peek through the window to see what we were writing on the blackboard ” recalls instructor Françoise Kondo Mwayuma. “She would plead with us until she would start crying  and just would not take no for an answer.” Brigitte’s determination paid off and soon she found herself sitting at a desk for the first time in her life  learning how to spell her name – the exciting first step of her education.  This International Women’s Day  share this story as a tribute to everyday heroes like Brigitte  who strive for better lives for themselves and their communities.,HER,photo

Thank you to everyone who sent a letter through our website  urging the Obama administration to ensure that sufficient U.S. funds go toward protecting Syrian women and girls. Your voice was heard.    The United States government just announced  ahead of a pledging conference in Kuwait tomorrow  that they will make a significant pledge of assistance for the millions of Syrians affected by the humanitarian crisis. In his announcement  President Obama said that the aid will support healthcare for victims of sexual violence  among other things. Sexual violence has been a significant and disturbing feature of the civil war in Syria.    That's a great start  but there is still work to be done. The U.N. now estimates that there are over 700 000 refugees in the region  200 000 of whom fled Syria in the past 7 weeks.  “The humanitarian disaster in and around Syria is immense and growing steadily worse ” said the IRC’s president  George Rupp. “We are encouraged by early and significant pledges by the US and UK governments and hope other nations will step up as well. It is critical that funding appeals are met  bilateral aid is scaled up for countries hosting large numbers of refugees  and diverse channels are used to get lifesaving aid to Syrians in dire need.”,HER,photo

On the blog  IRC President George Rupp shares another snapshot the IRC’s work - the story of Minhaj Gedi Fara  who emerged from famine- and violence-choked Somalia in late July 2011 weighing less than seven pounds. A picture taken of the suffering child by a photojournalist visiting the IRC health center in Kenya’s Dadaab refugee complex became the face of the humanitarian crisis in the Horn of Africa.  Three months later  a more joyful image of Minhaj touched the world. After intensive therapeutic feeding and three blood transfusions overseen by the IRC’s Dr. John Kiogora  Minhaj’s weight reached nine pounds — enough to plump up his cheeks and enable his release into the arms of his eager mother. He would still need outpatient treatment for tuberculosis and he was still a refugee  but his life was saved and his recovery was on track.  Today  a few months shy of his second birthday  Minhaj remains in Dadaab  just as the Horn of Africa remains stricken with drought and food insecurity. At a recent checkup at the IRC hospital  he was the picture of health  and his mother could not have been happier. In Dr. Kiogora’s words  “It gives you inspiration and energy to continue serving the people who need you.”  Learn more at http://www.Rescue.org/,HER,photo

In the midst of all the somber news about devastation from flooding in the United States  Haiti and Nigeria  a happier dispatch:   24-year-old Alphonsine was one of the very first mothers to give birth at the brand new hospital that the IRC built at Bengamisa  in northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo  with funding from the UK government. Inaugurated in October  the state-of-the-art hospital has four wards - Maternity  Surgery  Pediatrics and Internal Medicine - and can receive up to 240 patients at the same time. The IRC also fully equipped the hospital and provided all essential drugs.  In rural Congo  where health facilities are very scarce and poorly equipped  the vast majority of women give birth either at home  unassisted by qualified personnel  or in crumbling mud structures. Maternal mortality here is one of the highest in the world. (Photo: Bienvenu Lomande/IRC),HER,photo

Last week  IRC reproductive health staff delivered the first baby to be born in the Al-Buraiqa maternity ward of Aden Sora Clinic in southern Yemen -  a little girl who was named Afkar after the IRC-trained midwife who assisted her mother during the birth. After the delivery  the mother was given an injection  known as "anti-D"  to help prevent complications that could arise in future pregnancies as a result of her blood type. The staff also conducted a home visit shortly after the birth to make sure that both mother and baby were doing well – and they were!    The IRC has been supporting the Al-Buraiqa maternity ward with staff  training and supplies since August of this year. Early marriage  conflict  and poverty all work to make Yemen's maternal mortality rate the highest in the Arab world  with an estimated eight mothers dying every day in childbirth. At Al-Buraiqa  the IRC has recruited and trained midwives  doubled the doctors on staff  and provided critical medicine to allow for 24/7 delivery services. Afkar is the first of what will hopefully be many deliveries at the Center.,HER,photo
The IRC is expanding support for Syrian refugee women. After conducting emergency evaluations  the IRC has learned more about how women are being directly targeted by rape and other forms of sexual violence  and that that the dangers do not end once they’ve fled the country.

In Aden  Yemen  IRC community health volunteers are spreading the word about basic health care services available to thousands through an IRC-managed clinic. This month  the IRC's Rebecca Blum accompanied volunteers to a local school  where many families have been living for months after fleeing their homes due to conflict. A volunteer approached a young mother and encouraged her to visit the health clinic's nutrition center because her daughter looked malnourished.    Within just a few hours  that mother arrived with her daughter  who was indeed malnourished and in need of medical treatment.

Clara Bunker introduces young neighborhood kids to the joys of composting  during the International Rescue Committee in New York's second annual harvest festival at Drew Gardens in the Bronx this past Saturday. The festival brought together refugee gardeners  community gardeners  and their fellow New Yorkers to celebrate the bounty of another successful growing season in a New Roots garden.

Through New Roots  the IRC is helping resettled refugees to celebrate their heritage  nourish themselves and their neighbors and become self-sufficient by planting strong roots in their new communities. We provide the tools  training and land. Refugees provide the know-how  elbow grease and determination.  Now  Newman’s Own Foundation has offered to match all donations to New Roots dollar for dollar  up to $45 000. If we meet our goal  the additional money will support our New Roots and other refugee resettlement programs in cities across the United States.   Thank you for your support!,HER,link
Episode 5 of the New Roots webisode series is here! This week  we follow the younger generation of refugees as they adjust to life in the US with visits to the garden and starting school. If you need to catch up  check out all of the episodes at rescue.org/new-roots/video,HER,link

A breath of relief for refugees with asthma: Many people living with asthma have difficulty taking their medication using standard metered-dose inhalers. Add-on devices called spacers are designed to make inhalers easier to use and more effective  but they are prohibitively expensive for many people living with asthma in Kenya. Last October  IRC pharmacist Erenius Ngelecha came up with an alternative for his patients in the Kakuma refugee camp in northwestern Kenya  modifying sanitized one-liter water bottles that would otherwise be thrown away as a spacer substitute. Within a few months  his innovative “spacer” was being used by nearly 100 asthma patients in the camp. (Photo: Jane Yang/IRC),HER,photo

Over the years the Santa Barbara CA based Direct Relief Women of more than 200 women have come together with three goals in mind – educate  engage and fundraise for Direct Relief.    Putting together small events or gatherings that allow for speakers related to Direct Relief to share firsthand their stories and work has been a wonderful educational tool for both Direct Relief supporters and the local community. Partners such as Dr. Harshad Sanghvi have spoken and educated about low cost tools for safe deliveries and Dr. Edna Adan  a nurse and midwife from Somaliland has spoken to groups about the enormous challenges women face in delivering babies in Sub-Saharan Africa.    Direct Relief Women also do a lot of hands on activities such as packing personal care packs or dental kits in our warehouse that go to clinics  or assisting doctors and patients at a Direct Relief sponsored free dental clinic.    They’ve also helped raise a lot of money through their annual Mother’s Day event that they organize and promote. Last year  Direct Relief Women raised over $100 000 to support the Maternal Child Health programs at Direct Relief.    Through their focus on issues related to Maternal and Child Health  they are able to concentrate their efforts on a key issue for Direct Relief’s work and also an issue that is so close to the women’s own interests.  They have made a huge impact on our organization  our programs and to the people who are able to receive better health because of what they do.  We salute you and profoundly thank this group of dedicated  talented and thoughtful women!,LER,photo
Since 2007  the students of all ages who comprise Youth4DirectRelief have been raising awareness about global health and support for Direct Relief.

Among their efforts  Youth4DirectRelief holds a flower sale campaign each spring  which raised $30 000 in 2011 and broadened the reach of Direct Relief’s humanitarian medical aid.

The NYTimes ran an article today on Haiti's cholera epidemic  a disease that's spread through fecal contamination of water. Before the devestating earthquake  only 12% of the country had access to piped  treated water and after that number declined rapidly. That set up Haiti as a prime candidate for a cholera outbreak. Ten months after the quake  the country went from 0 cases of cholera to 3 500 dead in about 2.5 months.  Cholera is still a challenge for Haiti. This week  Direct Relief is giving Praecipio International a $20 000 grant to fund the Haiti Epidemic Advisory System (HEAS)--the world’s first National Weather Service-inspired infectious disease forecasting center. This grant will enable them to reactivate the network starting April 1 now that rainy season has begun in Haiti and early reports are already showing a rise in cases—as noted in the article.   The HEAS serves three basic functions:  1) issuance of forecasts for infectious diseases of medical or public health significance; 2) facilitation of the HEAS social network  which produces “live” situational awareness; and  3) facilitation of “switchboard operation” to rapidly connect warning to emergency response.   This will help to provide information to the various health actors around Haiti and lead to more rapid detection and confirmation and then response. It helps us at Direct Relief because we have pre-positioned in Haiti 6 cholera modules and 300 000 sachets of oral rehydration to respond immediately upon confirmation from the HEAS on a cholera spike.

Emergency preparedness packs were created by Direct Relief with input from experienced emergency responders  including physicians from the UCLA School of Medicine  the University of Pittsburgh  emergency field physicians from Australian Aid International  and representatives from the Santa Barbara Public Health Department and provided free of charge to Medical Reserve Corps members.  The packs are designed to include the most critical items for emergency medicine in a streamlined  “grab and go” backpack. The packs include supplies for infection control  diagnostics  trauma care  and personal protection. Cal EMSA has adopted Direct Relief’s EMT level MRC pack as the California State standard  and has asked Direct Relief to equip all current MRC units in California.     To date  Direct Relief has provided 1 235 Medical Reserve Corps (MRC) Med-Packs  to 15 MRC units across California  including those in Santa Barbara  Sacramento  San Diego  and Los Angeles.

For over 40 years Direct Relief has worked with local Haitian clinics and partners to deliver medical aid and supplies.

Every Friday morning since 1988  the Holy Rollers (ranging in age from 55-92) gather at Direct Relief to wrap bandages that are made from donated sheets from two luxury hotels.  They rip the sheets into 1/4 and 1/2" strips  use a hand-made wooden dowel to begin the wrap (this allows the bandage to be wrapped extraordinarily tight which is needed for packing)  wrap the sheet and secure. The bandages are then packed and shipped worldwide. To date  over 250 000 have been sent.  There are currently 16 volunteers and a long waiting list to join. Wondering why it’s limited to 16?

CVCD is the only institution in Bolivia providing diabetes prevention  care & treatment services to patients regardless of their ability to pay. Since its founding in 2002 more than 100K Bolivians have been tested for diabetes & over 11K cases have been detected through the program.  CVCD works with The Abbott Fund which has provided funding for the past 5 years to purchase glucometers and test strips which allows for the screening of people in rural communities. Once people are identified with having diabetes  their information is recorded via iPad into a database and they’re referred to a CVCD Clinic.  In 2009 CVCD was named 1 of 6 International Diabetes Federation Centers of Education & in 2011 as one of World Diabetes Foundation’s Centers of Excellence.

Jennifer is a young woman confined to a wheelchair and homeless in Toronto.  Watching Jennifer's video  I get emotional - and then I get mad.   Jennifer has spent much of her young life on the streets. In her teens  she spent six years outside. This is now the second winter outside since Jennifer has had a wheelchair.    Homelessness is hard. Now imagine being disabled and most homeless services are not wheelchair user accessible. Jennifer can get into the lobby of the nearest shelter  but after that the stairs prevent her from further access.   Please take a few moments and watch Jennifer say her three wishes at the end  and then please share this video with everyone you know.  Stories like Jennifers need to be seen and never forgotten.

Donate here: https://www.razoo.com/us/story/Invisiblepeople-2016  INVISIBLE PEOPLE CONNECTS PEOPLE TO THE FACE OF HOMELESSNESS in a direct and meaningful way that humanizes & normalizes the subject and builds empathy in the viewer. This is achieved by 'raw'  unedited and unscripted stories of people experiencing homelessness as well as through the medium chosen (social media and the internet).  THIS IS WAY MORE IMPORTANT AND IMPACTFUL THAN SIMPLE AWARENESS. It's easy for homeless people to be an 'other'. Invisible People makes them real people with real stories. Once people are real  normal and sympathetic  it is easier for the general public to take action in support of ending homelessness. That action can be giving  donating  volunteering or voting. Empathetic awareness is critical to creating change.  DID YOU KNOW that Invisible People is the only national awareness and educational campaign on homelessness? Just turn on the TV and you'll see anti-smoking ads  don't text and drive videos are all over the internet  and awareness campaigns from the need to recycle to global warming are everywhere we look  and they should be. Yet except for Invisible People  there are zero campaigns teaching the general public the truth about homelessness.  THE GENERAL PUBLIC RECEIVES MAJORITY OF THEIR EDUCATION ON HOMELESSNESS FROM NONPROFIT FUNDRAISING MATERIALS. Nonprofits flood mailboxes  inboxes and social media with marketing materials crafted with the sole purpose of acquiring donors. The information presented in fundraising materials is not always the truth  yet the vast majority of the general public accept this information as fact. The problem with this is  the public is misinformed and wrong stereotypes are reinforced through fundraising materials. This creates more nimbyism (not in my backyard) and more support for criminalization  which is increasing across the country. All this while one side is saying they are reducing homelessness  while the other side is calling for a State of Emergency to be declared because they have never seen homelessness so bad. This is why it's harder than ever to find support to help fight homelessness  and why Invisible People's work is important. .  This year I turn 55 years-old. 55 is kind of a big number and most birthday campaigns ask for donations based on the age. I am simply asking for a donation of any size. Every and any amount counts  and WITHOUT YOUR SUPPORT  THERE WOULD BE NO INVISIBLE PEOPLE.  Our work stops without you!  ***Your donation is tax deductible,HER,video

Ron is a disabled Vietnam veteran homeless in Boston.  This time  he has been without a home for five months. Ron was in transitional housing  but he says they were not helping and only taking his money.   Ron says he's living moment to moment while hoping for the best  yet he says that never happens.   Ron's story breaks my heart. No one should have to live on the streets homeless  and especially not the men and women who bravely served our country. It's interesting that cities around the U.S. are claiming they have put an end to veteran homelessness  and there has been a lot of progress  but the real truth is many veterans are still without a home and we still have a lot of work to do.,HER,video

Douglas is a disabled veteran living on the streets of Hollywood. He sleeps on the sidewalk every night.  Douglas says wherever he lays his head is home.   There is a big push in this country to end veteran homelessness  and there should be. Douglas is disabled and confined to a wheelchair. He is missing one leg. Clearly there is something wrong if Douglas is calling a sidewalk home.   Service providers have offered Douglas a bed in a shelter  but he finds the streets to be safer. During my Los Angeles trip  I ran into a few people who should not be homeless on Hollywood Blvd  and they were also only offered shelter  yet returned to the streets. I know the folks in Hollywood working to end homelessness and they are giving their all  but obviously  they are not being provided the tools or housing needed to help these people.  All of the folks I met received disability income and qualify for housing  but of course  there has to be housing available.   Douglas says he loves our country  but he feels our government sucks.  Knowing Douglas slept outside the night of this interview  I have to agree with him.   What do you think?,HER,video

I was working as an outreach case manager when Glendale Police called about a homeless man they found in an abandoned building. Upon arrival I found a scared older man huddled in a corner in the worst possible condition a human being can be. I took Lanny back to our facility and offered him a shower and some clean clothes.   Over the next few years Lanny and I became close friends. I would look for him almost every day when I was working outreach  and when I was traveling with Invisible People  Lanny would inquire with my co-workers asking for information about my return.   I committed to getting Lanny off the streets. It took 3 and a half years to get him into housing  but once he had his own place that provided personal dignity  the transformation for the better was immediate.   This video on Housing First helps share that part of the story http://invisiblepeople.tv/housingfirst   Lanny passed away this week. Last time I hung out with Lanny was last January.  I stopped by his apartment and took him to dinner.   Although I am saddened by Lanny's death  I know he had a good life in his very own apartment the last few years.   Lanny is proof we can end homelessness. There are a lot more Lanny's still on the street. We MUST do everything we can to end homelessness for EVERYONE!   Lanny changed my life in ways. I am grateful for the bond we developed. Lanny will be missed.   Good-bye Lanny. I love you!  Mark,HER,video

Arthur is a Vietnam era veteran who lives in the woods near Ithaca  New York.  A relationship gone bad and the high cost of housing left him no choice but to make a home outside.   Something as simple as making a cup of coffee in the morning takes Arthur 45 minutes. Think about that for a moment. Would you wait in line at Starbucks even 15 minutes for a Caramel Macchiato? It really hit me when I was helping Arthur work his cart down the trail.  While Arthur pushed I had to lift up the front so the wheels wouldn't dig into where the trail was soft. It was challenging to say the least  and I could not stop thinking that he makes this journey several times a day every single day!   President Obama has mandated that we will end veteran homelessness by the end of this year. That's a very good thing. Many communities are claiming that they have ended veteran homelessness.  I really want to believe them  but the real truth is there are many still experiencing homelessness and soldiers from Middle East hitting the streets every day. There has been noticeable progress   but stories like Arthur's only prove we still need to do more!,HER,video

It looked as though they had been sitting there for some time because of all the "stuff" they had with them. Maybe they were even living there.

“How can you rebuild a life you’ve never had” ~ Mike  Mike has been on the streets since he was 13 years-old. The powerful quote from Mike validates why we need to focus on ending street homelessness and youth homelessness at the same time  and not just one or the other.  The night before we met  someone stole his backpack with everything he had for his dog.  This is a very powerful video. Mike talks about how people judge him for being homeless  and then judge that he can't take care of his dog. Honestly  most of the general population care more about pets then to do homeless people. Time and time again I've seen people literally freak out over a homeless dog completely ignoring the homeless person.  Mike also shares about how lines outside a store are celebrated  yet homeless people just cannot sit on a sidewalk.  Listen to Mike's second wish. It's very powerful!,HER,video

John is sleeping outside in Philadelphia. He tried shelters  but someone stabbed John trying to steal his boots  so he feels safer sleeping on the streets even though the overnight windchill is reported to be a deadly -11° or worse.   John had a great job in the telecommunications industry fixing police and fire communication systems. He fell on the job  which resulted in serious injuries. John was in a coma for some time  and he claims his homelessness is a result of insurance industry abuse. Clearly John is disabled  yet he has not been approved for disability benefits. John is vulnerable  and he should not be on the streets - period!   Moments before we met John   a woman spit on him simply because John asked her for a cigarette. Like most urban centers anymore  downtown Philadelphia is filled with large groups of homeless people nestled up alongside fancy restaurants  pricey shopping  and executive offices. This mixture of two extremely different socioeconomic classes can be volatile at times. I don't agree with this woman's actions  but something in the past  aggressive panhandling or an intoxicated homeless person verbally assaulting her could have influenced such awful behaviors. We must get people experiencing homelessness the help they need  and we need more funding for educational and awareness campaigns to change public perceptions about homelessness.

Click here: http://invisiblepeople.tv/birthday  It's  that time again. The time of year where Facebook lets you all know I am  now a year older on March 13th. Well  up until the last few years I  hated my birthday. Thanks to all of your generous hearts my birthday has  turned into a real miracle. Over the last three years you've helped  raise $36 000 to help fight homelessness.  PLEASE READ THIS NEXT PARAGRAPH:  "The  stereotypes of people living in poverty throughout the United States  are among the most negative prejudices that we have. And people  basically view particularly homeless people as having no redeeming  qualities" ~ Susan Fiske  Professor of Psychology. Princeton University  Invisible People's work is important!  I  strongly believe that if the general public viewed our homeless  neighbors as being the real people that they are  there wouldn't be such  humiliation and violence against people experiencing homelessness!  Awareness and education on homelessness can change that  and your  support in funding Invisible People is breaking wrong stereotypes and  changing how tens of millions of lives view homeless individuals.  DID  YOU KNOW that Invisible People is the only national awareness and  educational campaign on homelessness? Just turn on the TV and you'll see  anti-smoking ads  don't text and drive videos are all over the  internet  and causes from the need to recycle to global warming are  everywhere we look  and they should be. Yet except for Invisible People   there are zero campaigns teaching the general public about  homelessness.  This year I turn 54 years-old. 54 is kind of a big  number and most birthday campaigns ask for donations based on the age.  So let's cut my age in half. If each and every one of you could simply  make a donation of $27 it would go a long way to reaching our goal. Of  course   if you would like to donate $54 000  or even $5 400 please do. I  am being a little funny. The truth is $5  $10  $25  $54 - any and every  amount counts. This is the one campaign that fuels Invisible People  throughout the year and we desperately need your support to help end  homelessness.  Thank you in advance for your time and support ,HER,video

Homer has been sleeping rough in London for the last 20 years. Homer has tried staying in hostels  but he feels it's like being in prison.   Homer basically has been in the system all his life. At the age of 3 months he was in a children's home and then transitioned into a boy's hostel when he got older.   Near the end of this video Homer shares about the realities of life and death on the streets. It's very powerful and I hope you watch to the end.   This video was recorded on the last night of my stay  but I actually met Homer on the day I arrived.  When we first met he didn't want to be on video and I always respect everyone's wishes. Over the next week or so I stopped and talked to him  gave him socks  and just made general conversation every time I saw him. When I stopped to say good-bye he requested that I video his story. It was an amazing moment and I am honored to have spent enough time with Homer to call him friend.

Christine works at McDonalds overnight and her daughter works there during the day. They are working homeless: living in a weekly rate hotel and splitting shifts so one of them is there to take care of the younger children.  It's a vicious cycle.  Minimum wage does not allow them enough money to afford first and last months rent to move out of the hotel  nor does it allow for them to afford babysitters.   If they stop working or get sick  they end up on the streets or a homeless shelter. 5 people living in one small hotel room is now the new American Dream because in many ways... it's now the new middle class!  If you haven't noticed watching the videos on this site  the interviews that mess me up the most you can tell by the space between my questions. Plus  that I just can't concentrate enough to ask questions. This story messed me up and I almost forget to ask Christine about her 3 wishes. My heart goes out to every family trying to survive in poverty. I wish I could simply take all their pain away.  Special thanks to Paul Kruse http://firststepbackhome.net,HER,video

Without income it was only a matter of time before he became homeless.   Earlier today I had a chat with a local outreach team that focuses on abandoned buildings.  When I asked the person if he knew what I did he responded "ya we have housed a few people in your videos".  My hope is Moon will be one of them soon!,HER,video

Tammy has been "jumped" twice by kids and adults going on a rampage setting fires and abusing homeless people  but that's not the least of her worries. She has lived in the tent you see behind her for a few years and soon the city will be bulldozing the land because of new construction.   For Tammy  even with the dangers she feels safer living in a tent community than at a shelter.  She calls the community her family and in many ways they become one.   I was with an outreach team in Columbus  Ohio checking on all the "campers" to see if everyone had any needs and to place people on a housing list. Their goal is to get everyone the support they need before the tent community is eradicated.  I hope and pray Tammy makes it into a housing program.

Three years ago Randy walked out of a relationship and has been living outside homeless ever since.  Syracuse winter's are bitter cold  and this winter has been one of the worst. No one should be without adequate housing   especially in extreme climates.   Randy's hand is frostbitten. When he talked about the black falling off my heart stopped. I can't even imagine the fear and powerlessness Randy must feel.    I happened to be with John Tumino  who runs a local ministry reaching out to chronic homeless people  and John told me he had taken Randy to an emergency room in the recent past. Sadly  frostbite is not the worst of Randy's health issues. He has a serious heart condition  yet the first he can get in to see a doctor is over a month and a half away.   Randy survives by recycling and panhandling. He told me he was recently arrested for panhandling and given 30 days in jail.  Criminalization of homelessness is on the rise and it's also the most expensive way to deal with homeless crisis.  If your community supports passing laws that put homeless people in jail  just open your bank account up to pay more taxes. Plus  after jail people are just placed back on the streets so the problem gets worse not better!     Special thanks to In My Father's Kitchen    .,HER,video

Imagine working all your life and then in your senior years the only option for retirement is living in a park. When we recorded this interview   Dennis was a few months shy of turning 60 years-old and had been experiencing homelessness for a little less than 5 months.   Dennis said  "I used to make fun of the homeless until I became one"  which should stand out as a reminder to all of us that homelessness can happen to anyone.   A divorce changed his living situation. Dennis then developed health issues and stayed in a board and care until the high cost forced him to transition to a winter shelter program. When the winter shelter closed  Dennis had no other options except to sleep outside.   We have a "Silver Tsunami" coming.  Boomer generation is now entering into what should be their comfortable retirement years. Instead  because this last recession wiped out a lot more than hopes and dreams  seniors will enter into homelessness at an alarming rate.    Distributed by OneLoad.com,HER,video

It was snowing pretty bad when I met Bill in Syracuse. I must have had some snow on my face because when I walked up to say hello  Bill took out some Kleenex and started to wipe my face dry. I stood there in the cold overwhelmed by this kind gesture from a gentle homeless man. Bill only knew me for a moment  yet he was concerned enough about a complete stranger to clean off my face.   Bill has been on the streets for some time. He suffers from PTSD because of a violent attack many years ago.   He sleeps in an abandoned loft he claims was one used by an artist. The last time Bill stayed in a homeless shelter someone stole his dentures while he was sleeping.   The Housing First model may be a fit for someone like Bill. He's never going to go back to gainful employment and no one should stay in the shelter system without a direct pass to housing. Bill broke my heart. I tried to talk him into walking to a shelter with me  but he said he knows how to wrap up at night.  Someday soon I hope we'll have a system where an outreach worker can walk up to a person like Bill and give him a key to an apartment. Until then  all I can do is open my wallet to help make Bill's night a little easier.    Special thanks to Syracuse Rescue Mission   . Distributed by OneLoad.com,HER,video

I met Keith while driving around in an outreach van during subzero weather. Keith wonders how he didn't freeze to death sleeping outside during what is now called the "Polar Vortex". He continues that he has been sleeping under one bridge or another for over 20 years now.  We offered to help  but Keith didn't want the help we had to offer. Keith drank 3 beers that day so he would not be allowed into an abstinence based program  and he did not feel safe sleeping at the local low-barrier shelter. Plus  and this is a big one - Keith didn't want to get a few hours of sleep just to be kicked out the next morning into the freezing cold. He said that going into a shelter just to be kicked out every morning is like having "only half of a house".  I am still in Upstate New York and the weather report is forecasting subzero weather again. Most of our homeless friends like Keith  who have been on the streets for a long time  have adopted ways of surviving. NO ONE should have to sleep outside  especially when doing so is life-threatening.  We must change our systems so people who end up homeless do so for only a short period of time. It's unacceptable that Keith has been on the streets for over 20 years. Communities must also work together to provide the right services at the right time. Keith wanted help to get out of the cold  we just were not able to provide the help he needed.  The saying in homeless services is homeless people like Keith are "service resistant". I think that's   crap because if homeless services would simply listen to folks like Keith  and then PROVIDE THE SERVICES PEOPLE REALLY NEED  we could actually end homelessness.

After returning from tours of Iraq and Afghanistan  Michael found himself back in America with a drug and alcohol addiction  which quickly led to job loss and then homelessness.   Michael is homeless in Syracuse "flying a sign" on a subzero winter day just to get a few dollars to survive. Weather report at the time of this interview was around minus 15 °F. I had to take my gloves off just for a moment to setup the camera  and the tips of my fingers burned like they were on fire for the next half hour. Michael said he had been standing there for two hours. Luckily  Catholic Charities is providing shelter for him at night  but the day before on the same corner I gave socks and gloves to a man who is sleeping outside during this weather.    When I asked Michael what he wanted the world to know about being a homeless veteran he responded: " for a person to be homeless it's a shame  for a veteran to be homeless it's a tragedy."

Norman says when he first hit the streets of New York City he didn't know anything about homelessness. He didn't know where to go. He didn't know where to sleep. He didn't know where his next meal would come from.   The night before this interview  Norman slept in a subway station. Even now  after a few years being on the streets  Norman shares about how unsafe it is just trying to get a nights rest.   Norman tried the shelter system  but because of conflict as a result of the person next to him using drugs  he was asked to leave and was told he had to wait for an extended period to come back. Norman says the NYC shelter system basically just warehouses people and offers little or no help to better their lives.  When I asked Norman for his 3 wishes he responded  "Get out of homelessness.

Robyn and Mickey are both 17 years-old and homeless in Ottawa  Canada. Once Mickey begins to talk  you can tell that these young adults have aged beyond their years.   Robyn says that because shelters will not take dogs or allow them all to stay together  that they'd rather stay on the streets sleeping rough.   On their first night homeless both of them were stressed and scared. They stayed under a bridge until someone gave them a tent and they now live in the woods. The Salvation Army outreach team took me there  and looked like their sleeping bags and everything they had was soaked from the rain. Clearly  this is no way for people to live.   No way for 17 year-old's to live.      Very special thanks to Ottawa Salvation Army and Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness.  Distributed by OneLoad.com,HER,video

A different kind of TED: Health care for the homeless http://ow.ly/qdpa2,HER,link
Donna's story is a perfect example of why we need to listen to our homeless friends. Donna is homeless in Ottawa  Canada. She has serious health issues  yet manages to travel over 7 kilometers every day with her boyfriend collecting cans to raise money to eat  and to fix her RV to get off the streets.   One thing I have learned  is people often connect to geographic locations and that's where they want to live. Donna was raised in the Maritimes   a region of Eastern Canada. Her and her boyfriend ended up in Ontario because that's where their RV broke down and they could also get health benefits. As you'll see in this video  Donna pretty much only had one wish: to get back home to look after her mom's grave.   Here's the issue: services in Ottawa will never house Donna simply because she doesn't want to live here. In her mind  although it's been some time  she is just passing through. The other challenge is there is no grant funding to help Donna with the repairs on her RV  even though it's not that much money.   This type situation is what is often called "gaps in the safety net"  but I think it's really because we don't listen or use common sense. To me  it's pretty simple - help Donna and her boyfriend get their RV fixed and get to the Maritimes = two really happy people who....now wait for it...ARE NO LONGER HOMELESS!   We did this before you may remember. Thanks to all of you we helped a disabled veteran get his RV out of impound http://invisiblepeople.tv/blog/2010/08/thanks-to-social-media-johnny-will-get-his-home-back/  Local Salvation Army told me it'd be around $500cdn and a few tanks of gas to get Donna's RV repaired and out of the lot (were they are being charged daily) and back to the Maritimes. We are guessing around $800cdn will do it. Ottawa Salvation Army has graciously offered to facilitate logistics if we raise the funds. That means they'll make sure the RV gets fixed the Donna gets off safely  and they'll make sure they are connected on the other end of this journey.   Here is the link to our donate page http://invppl.tv/donate. If 8 people give $100 each it's done. If 16 people give $50 each game over. If just 32 of you give $25 we can help make Donna's wish come true and get an elderly homeless woman out of the cold. Please give generously and let's make this happen for Donna.

I am pissed! I am so mad right now! I just hate ignorance! More on that in a moment.   I met Lars in San Diego a few months ago. Lars was laid off from his job of 5 years  and when unemployment extensions ran out  he had no choice but to live in his car.   Lars was lucky that he found Dreams for Change  a nonprofit that helps support people living in their vehicles. I wrote about the program here:   http://invisiblepeople.tv/blog/2013/08/people-living-in-vehicles-need-safe-places-to-park-not-fines-or-jail/  While traveling this last month I saw that Vista  California was trying to shut down one of Dreams for Change parking lot programs at a local church. I did happen to visit that church  but all the stories  except for the interview with Teresa Smith  CEO of Dreams for Change  were recorded at another church parking lot outside of Vista.   Why I am so mad is I just learned that they did have to shut down the program at the church in Vista. Neighbors started yelling obscenities at the homeless and volunteers and made angry phone calls to the church  which made the situation unsafe. http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2013/oct/04/tp-park-and-sleep-charity-at-church-shuts-down/  I just wrote and than backspaced a bunch of obscenities myself.   Neighbors of Cornerstone Church in Vista - YOU SUCK! Homelessness is getting worse  and the best way to fight homelessness is to support programs like Dreams for Change that are helping people get out of homelessness.

Pregnant and unable to work  after resources ran out  Lisa and Lexus ended up in a weekly rate hotel in Wentzville  just outside of St Louis.

This video you MUST watch to the end. Normally  after I ask someone for their 3 wishes - we end. But Brion didn't want any wishes  and when he started to explain why  he opened up about his childhood and growing up in foster care.   Brion got back from the army after being discharged for health reasons. His mom asked him for his money so she could buy drugs. When Brion said no  his mother went to the police to have him removed from her apartment.   Brion is a homeless youth in Pittsburgh. Some nights it was safer to stay up all night then to fall asleep and become vulnerable.    At around 3 minutes in to this video Brion shares candidly about the problem of putting a child into different foster care placements. Brion was placed into his first foster home at 9  and says he was in 13 placements until he aged out at 18. Now at age 20  Brion says everyone who grows up with that much inconsistency becomes a product of the "system"!  Sadly  Brion's story is very common. According to California Progress Report  65% of youth in foster care emancipate without a place to live. 40% of persons living in homeless shelters are former foster children. A similarly disproportionate percentage of the nation’s prison population is comprised of former foster youth. Less than 3% go to college and 51% are unemployed.  The good news is that although the story of a broken foster care system is common  young men like Brion are not. I cannot predict the future  but I can almost guarantee Brion is going to put all the madness behind him and have an amazing life!

Scotty has been homeless in Denver since he was 13 years-old. He's 23 now and still homeless  and says he's kind of gotten used to to being on the streets.   At 13  Scotty's mother kicked him out into the streets. He survived with the support of older homeless kids in the downtown area of Denver.

Charles is 22 and living on the streets of Denver. Charles says homelessness is hard and homeless youth do the best they can  but he continues that the community often works against them.   When I first walked up on Charles he was writing out his sign to panhandle. Being a marketer by trade I was curious and asked him what works. Charles responded "the truth"  which is a brilliant lesson for all of us.  Charles has been homeless since 16 years-old. He was in foster care  and says he was in well over 25 placements before he decided to run away.   As I travel focusing on homeless youth  I keep hearing horrible stories of foster care being repeated. Our broken foster care system plays a huge role in both youth and adult homelessness.

WARNING: This video will mess you up!   Being on a road trip focusing on homeless youth it was important to tell the story of the homelessness you don't see - the millions of American families living in weekly rate hotels just barley one step from street homelessness. In fact  when I met this wonderful family today  they were packing up to leave and live in their car. The hotel had given them one day's grace  but they were completely out of money with no place to go. I am still emotional thinking about it even hours later. Truth is  thousands upon thousands of families face being evicted from a hotel to the streets every single day! This family was lucky. I tweet out what I call a "Hail Mary" and a generous heart stepped up and donated a weeks stay. That too messed me up!   Michael  Danielle  and their six children live in one hotel room near St Louis. Michael works a full time job  and they used to rent a house  but their landlord didn't pay the mortgage. After the bank took the property back  Michael  Danielle  and their six children were evicted with no place to go.   Hotel homelessness becomes a trap. Hotel's cost more than an apartment  but you can move right in without deposit  and a hotel room is far better than the streets. Once in  people who are considered the working poor  have an impossible time trying to save up enough money to afford adequate housing. Often these hotels are not a good place for kids to grow up.   There is a lot of emotion in this video. I get messed up throughout  but when the parents start talking about having to run in to the bathroom to cry so the kids don't see - I'm done! I am pissed that families have to live like this and heartbroken because I can literally feel their pain. I don't speak about this much  but I was raised by my mother and we went through some hard years when I was young.   If I could get you to watch just one video all the way to the end  and then share  this would be that video. This family is filled with strength and love  and has the courage to share their very real story about the homeless you don't see  but need to see!

Lexsis breaks my heart. This adorable young woman has been hardened by the system and homelessness. Only 19  Lexsis has grown up most of her life on the streets.  I met Lexsis in Denver  Colorado. She says every day is a struggle for food and safe place to sleep. Lexsis says people should look at homeless youth through their eyes  that they are not after money but acceptance and security.   Lexsis went into foster care as a little girl. When I asked how many placements she responded "57". That number seemed a little high to me so I asked a social worker who specializes in youth and was told high numbers of placements like that are not uncommon. How can any child grow up normal when they are being tossed around the system like that?!!

Ditsy is 19 years-old and homeless in Salt Lake City  Utah. As you'll quickly see  Ditsy loves kids. He told me that helping and playing with the homeless kids in the park makes him feel better about his younger years.  Although this was a fun interview  the fact that every kid in this video is homeless is a serious tragedy.   Ditsy says being a homeless youth is not the hardest thing he has done  but it's also not the easiest. He says he struggles for food  and has to worry about police when sleeping. As hard as homelessness is  Ditsy says if you can stay optimistic  it becomes a little easier. Smart words for such a young man.   When I started to talk to Ditsy about sharing his story the kids were not really around. Before I knew it the kids became part of this story so I just ran with it. While recording  I kept thinking about the challenges of finding all the parents to get their permission. This was a public park at dusk  and who knows where everyone is.   Ditsy took me to the first mother and I handed her a business card. I give everyone a business card with my email and cell number. The mother didn't really say much when another woman  surrounded by a group of people  started to yell at me to come to her. The first mother ran to this woman and handed her my business card. My first thoughts were that I was in trouble. My second thought was that no way was I going to get permission and this whole thing is about to go bad.   To my shock  the woman asked me to take photos of all their kids and family portraits of everyone. There were probably 3 or maybe 4 homeless families hanging out  and they all wanted portraits. I am not a still photographer and my gear is all setup for video. It was dark  I didn't have lights  and I had the wrong lens. I only say that because I wish I could have done better for all of them. I told them I would let me friends at Help Portrait [http://help-portrait.com] know what shelter they are in so they can get photos done right.   For the next 45 minutes I had so much fun  and so did all of them posing for photos. It was as if the world was alright and none of them were experimenting homelessness. Here is a link to a few of the family portraits I took tonight http://hardlynormal.tumblr.com/post/59928558609/just-a-few-of-the-homeless-family-photos-i-took-in So obviously  not only did I get every parents permission I made a bunch of new friends in the process.

At only 14 years old  Elaina made the decision to leave home rather than live with her mother's drug abuse. That's a pretty hard call for a young child to make  yet today I met a few homeless youth in Salt Lake City  Utah that felt the streets were better than home.    For the last 6 years Elaina has been on her own and in some state of homelessness. At one point she had an apartment  but it's really hard for kids be mature enough to maintain housing. Plus  at 16 or so  the only income a youth can find is at best part time  and that's not enough money to live off.     Elaina is a new mother. She says now having a son helps motivate her to do better. Soon  she'll be in her own apartment thanks to rapid rehousing program that's aimed at homeless youth.

Donald is on social security  but he keeps getting denied housing because of his past. Donald needs to have back surgery  but because he does not have a place to stay to recover  they won't do the surgery.   Donald says he is on parole and they don't have a solution.

I was walking around San Diego wearing Google Glass when Charlie  a man who has been homeless for over a decade  stopped and started a conversation with me.   When I started the interview and asked Michelle  Charlie's wife  what it was like to be homeless in San Diego  she immediately started to share how police officers constantly harass them.   Michelle says that it was not until she moved to California that she became aware of homelessness. Now she has lived on the streets over eight years!   This is the last interview that I will 'intentionally' record with Google Glass. People have requested I stop using them for interviews mainly because of the audio issues.

Joesph is completely blind in one eye and partially blind in the other. Watching him try to navigate a San Diego street with a white cane while pushing a shopping cart broke my heart.  Joesph is 75 years-old and homeless. He says he ended up on the streets because someone "cleaned him out"  yet Joesph still maintains his serenity.  Joesph's story is one of the many stories you hear on the streets that seems hard to believe. I always try and remember that when I was homeless  and I told people I worked in television  they probably didn't believe me either  but I was telling the truth.    In 1983  Joesph says he was shot in the head by a 14 year-old boy. The boy was walking through a parking lot and found a 357 magnum laying on the ground. The boy picked up the gun and it accidentally went off hitting Joesph in the head. The boy then called the police and the paramedics.   Joesph says the boy was an honor student and received 20 years in prison for the shooting. Joesph then worked for 16 months to get the boy out of prison. Joesph says the person responsible was not the boy that accidentally fired the gun  but the person who "misplaced" the gun  who Joesph claims was a parole officer.   As crazy as this story may sound  I have to remember miracle stories like Lydia Bardak  who after being brutally raped  saved the life of her attacker [http://bit.ly/r88dd9]  Joesph's amazing story doesn't end there  but you're just going to have to watch it yourself for the rest.     .

Karen lives in a car with her dog in San Diego. She says the hardest thing about being homeless is the loneliness.   Karen says she feels invisible. At one time she had an important job and lots of social interaction  but now she says it's rare to have a conversation with another person. Earlier  Karen was parked near a public park and was cleaning out her car. She was feeling invisible and hadn't talked to anyone  then a dog came into the park and caught everyone's attention making Karen feel even more invisible.   I know each Invisible People story is different and each story relates to people differently. Karen's story messed me up because I remember like it was yesterday  when I was homeless  watching 'normal' people with their families play in a park. The feeling of depression was often overwhelming as I wondered if I'd ever have a normal life again. I am even getting emotional typing this.   Karen is happy she has a car and feels it will help her get a job. I'm happy there are places like Dreams for Change's safe parking program so people living in their car have a safe place to park and help getting back in to housing!     .

Ticketing people like Phil  who have a small fixed income  will greatly increase taxpayer costs.   Phil simply wants to get his RV fixed so they can all drive to Arkansas to be with family.

T.J. has been homeless in San Francisco for the last three years. After getting sick he was not able to keep his job  and with no family or friends ended up on the streets.   Because T.J. is disabled  he gets $900 a month  but that is not enough for housing and food. He tried the shelter system  but he says the insane standing while waiting in line makes it not worth it.   T.J. is just of many older American's who are not able to work  yet benefits do not support housing!     . Distributed by OneLoad.com,HER,video

Share's story is a very candid interview on the connection between incarceration and homelessness.    I was walking down Market Street in San Francisco and Shane and I started a conversation. He asked why I had a camera in my hand  so I told him about my work. He then asked why I hadn't asked him to record an interview. I explained I never interview people who are intoxicated out of respect and he seemed to have been partying. He laughed and said "I always look like this and I have only had one beer today. You should see me when I am wasted!"   After his first 7 years in prison Shane went to the Union Rescue Mission in Los Angeles. Shane says he was doing good working the program. He was sober and even quit smoking for close to 9 months. Then one day he got a jaywalking ticket  and because any contact with police is a violation of his parole  Shane went back to jail for 6 months. 6 months jail time for jaywalking?!!   After that Shane just gave up. When he was let out he just ran  and each time he got busted again he asked for maximum time.   Shane used his time inside wisely. He learned 6 languages and earned 43 college credits  and studied about the cost of incarceration. Shane said the last report he read the federal government pays $340 in housing per day to the prison. When a prisoner is moved inside the prison gets paid $50 per move. When a prisoner is transported to court it's $75 each way. Shane says that the prison system says they spend $486k per year per inmate  yet in reality actual cost is $134k per inmate. I am not sure where Shane got his figures from  but according to Versa  prisons in California cost tax payers over $7 billion in 2010. The United States makes up just 5% of the global population  but accounts for 25% of the global prison population. You do all know private prisons are a growth industry and their stocks are traded on Wall Street? There is little to no incentive for people like Shane to get back to a normal life  and as a taxpayer - we are footing the bills!   I like Shane. He is a good guy that has just given up. He has spent so much time in jail that homelessness is where he feels comfortable  and that's just wrong!    . Distributed by OneLoad.com,HER,video
One might say Daniel has purpose. He spends his days filling up a shopping cart with "items" he thinks may sound good. When his musical percussion kit is ready  he finds a spot near the Union Square area of San Francisco to setup and entertain himself and anyone who just happens to be walking by.   Daniel is a convicted felon  and because of his past and going to prison  he cannot get a job or collect public assistance. 60 present of prisons and jails are filled with non-violent drug offenders. When they are released back into society it's almost impossible to find employment and they are not even allowed food stamps. Without any normal means to survive many go back to committing crimes.   Daniel has found a simple way to keep busy and to make a few bucks. He has 10 years off heroin and also kicked cocaine  but because of his felonies  his only choice was to adapt to homelessness.

David has been homeless since the age of 12. He first started "couch surfing"  but by age 17 David ran out of places to visit and ended up on the streets.   Even while living on the streets  David worked hard to stay in school. A social worker eventually connected with David and let him know about Jovenes  the youth shelter where he currently lives.    I met David at the Street Soccer West Coast Cup this past week in San Francisco.

"They call it a hotel but it's an insane asylum" Fujji says about the Baldwin Hotel in San Francisco. Roach infested  rats  ceiling tiles falling down  holes in the floor  and garbage all over are just a few of the reasons Fujji and his wife felt living on the streets would be safer and cleaner.    In the room they lived in you had to turn on the water from below the sink. After making requests for repairs and getting no response  Fujji stopped paying rent.   Over a decade ago  during my first month of homelessness  I stayed in this type of hotel. When my money ran out (I paid for a week) management gave me the option to work at one of their other hotels in Hollywood in exchange for a room. This seemed like a smart move because I didn't want to live outside  but what I thought was a plan turned into a nightmare. The owners of the hotel were nasty people with no conscious regard as to how people should be treated.   As a TV producer I once snuck a camera into Los Angele's infamous Ford Hotel. The hotel is now remolded  but at the time it was like out of a horror movie. I remember walking into a bathroom and watching hundreds of roaches run up the wall from a bathtub. You could not even imagine how horrible the Ford Hotel was at the time  yet it was home to many low-income families with children.   We have a serious affordable housing crisis in this country. We need more low-income housing  but that housing should also be fit for humans to live in. Sadly  there are people who care more about money than people and take advantage of those with little influence.   People like Fujji and his wife  who both are on a fixed disability income  should be able to find a clean and safe place to call home! Distributed by OneLoad.com,HER,video
Pete came up to me on the streets of San Francisco offering to give me a cover for my phone. He didn't want anything for it. He just must have seen me twittering away and thought I could use one. Not sure where he got them  but I was kind of took back a little that a disabled homeless man was being so nice to a stranger.   Pete and I got into a conversion about homeless and life  but mostly about needs. He showed me the tires on his wheelchair where the rubber was pretty much gone.    Pete says he lost his leg to bone cancer. Pete says the cancer was a result of being exposed to Agent Orange during his two tours of Vietnam.   Pete says he was in housing  but the VA stopped his benefits because of some bureaucracy. I hear this often  and I was reminded of what Dale said to me about the VA when I interviewed him in 2010 now featured in this clip about veteran homelessness http://youtu.be/SGSE4HpTX2s    There is good news. I was invited to attend a San Francisco Homes for Heroes meeting today  where in collaboration with a group of national and local services providers  100 veterans will be housed in the next 100 days.

Dawn's sign reads "PREGNANT & STRESSED!!" as she sits begging for change in San Francisco. She is hoping to get enough money to pay for a hotel room.   Dawn has had a challenging life. She first started shooting heroin at 12 years-old. Both of her parents were drug addicts. She then started traveling and hopping trains until she was 28  when she got pregnant with her second son. Dawn says she was tired of the streets and the drugs.   Travelers are a subculture of homeless youth that are known for hopping trains. You've seen them hanging out in your city. They almost have a uniform wearing brown clothes and often have dogs. Most of the kids seem happy  and the hippie lifestyle looks attractive. Truth is  many of these kids are "throw away" often running from horrible family situations. They find community with each other  but as young adults this lifestyle does not come with any professional or even social development. One youth leader once told me she was concerned because these kids don't get the nutrition they need. As fun as the traveling lifestyle may look I have often wondered how many of these kids end up as chronic homeless in their adult years. Dawn is one.   Dawn has been in and out of rehabs. Her story validates a very serious problem in social services we need to fix. More often than not drugs programs do not coordinate with other support services. What this means is when a person wants to get sober we can find them a detox  but after they are placed back on the streets  and it's nearly impossible to do homeless sober!   Dawn's three wishes resonate with me in a very powerful way. Although Dawn seems happy she is holding back so much sadness. She is a gorgeous woman with lots of life inside here. We need to help her and all the Dawns just like her on the streets of America.      . Distributed by OneLoad.com,HER,video

A few years back  Theresa ended up homeless after her mother died. She was in and out of shelters  but never got a chance to grieve until she found a home at Nickelsville  a tent community near downtown Seattle.    Theresa says that Nickelsville is like a breath of fresh air. Clearly  Nickelsville has become Theresa's family. Nickelsville is not without problems  but they probably get along better and get more done than that community in Washington DC.   Personally  I live tent communities. They often provide what homeless shelters miss  and I strongly believe homeless services can learn much from places like Nickelsville. Distributed by OneLoad.com,HER,video

In 2008  Mark's wife and daughter died  and shortly after he had a nervous breakdown. Mark then spent seven months in a hospital getting better. Mark then found out that no matter how legitimate a reason  that if you don't show up to work or pay your bills for several months  you lose everything!  Mark then spent a year homeless. He got a job washing dishes at a deli and worked his way off the streets. Business slowed  and he ended back out on the streets again.   Mark says that this time around he still has faith in himself  but he has lost faith in the system. Mark encourages us all to stand together because he says it's a human issue not a homeless issue. Mark believes that we all should have the basic essentials of a house and food  and I could not agree more.   Mark is a kind and gentle soul. He is someone who has "slipped through the gaps of the safety net"  and should have never ended up on the streets. Sadly  I hear stories like his often. We must do better in mental heath services and we most certainly need to keep people who are trying to get better from ending up on the streets  where many just get worse!,HER,video
A year ago Laura had a job she loved  a car  and a house for her and her two kids. Today  she is lucky that Seattle's YWCA is helping her move out of a tent community into a hotel room.   I met Laura while she was moving what possessions she had left from Nickelsville  a tent community located just outside of Seattle's downtown area  to a hotel room provided by the YWCA's family homelessness program . Her and her kids stayed at Nickelsville for a week after "timing out" from a 30 day shelter. Laura was lucky to have a place to go. Nickelsville is the only tent community that allows children  but living in a tent in not the best situation for young kids. The staff at Nickelsville and several social services agencies work together so that families and single parents with young kids get the help they need.   If you are not aware  and I feel a blog post on this topic coming soon  many shelters are transitional with 30 - 90 day programs. Some may go for a year or two  which actually makes a lot more sense. Who can get their life back in 90 days or less?!! NO ONE! When a resident goes past the allotted time  in Larua's case 30 days  the family "timed out" and has to be removed from the shelter. Ideally  that would be to their own apartment or a longer transitional program  but that takes a small miracle to happen. Many places just give a reference to a new shelter and do not even provide transportation  or they will "dump" clients to other shelter programs  such as an emergency shelter that takes anyone. (Catherine was dumped to a winter shelter program  where she was kicked out in to the streets and eventually died http://bit.ly/Yi9PL0)  I have a lot of respect for Laura. While talking to her  she told me stories of her childhood that were beyond horrible. What she had to do as a child is unthinkable  but she keeps fighting hard to make a better life for her two boys  even against all odds.

Sabrina is 23 and living under a bridge in Seattle. Sabrina and an old boyfriend hitchhiked to Seattle to spend a few weeks. Those weeks have now turned into four years of homelessness.   Sabrina says she has been on her own since she was 16. She left her home town to explore the world  yet like so many other kids these days  she fell into the addiction of heroin.   If you've been following me for a bit  you've probably heard me talk about heroin being the perfect drug to forget the pain of homelessness.  Cheap  easy to get  and the effects help you forget all the pain! Trouble is  heroin is extremely addictive  and in a very short time a person goes from getting high to needing a fix to 'maintain'. Without the fix a heroin addict gets violently sick. For reference  Cameron gave a very honest and candid interview about addictions that you can watch here http://bit.ly/HnVpjs .   There is a lot more research about homelessness and it's causes these days  and that's a good thing. For years  I have been asking people far smarter than I am to start researching how many homeless youth end up chronically homeless as adults. I would gather because of socioeconomic and physiological reasons a lot of homeless kids stay homeless  which to me  is a very serious crisis.   Last week I was in Portland and I met a few young kids all addicted to heroin. Many of them still had their youthful appearance  but you could tell the drugs and the street life where quickly taking a toll.    At 23 Sabrina still has a long and fruitful life in front of her  but being very real  our socially would rather lock up a drug addict them help them get back to a normal life. We really need to work on helping homeless youth get the support they need before they end up using hard drugs for any length of time.  Sabrina's story breaks my heart  and knowing there are thousands upon thousands of other youth out there in the same situation wrecks me!     .Distributed by OneLoad.com,HER,video
In general  a chronically homeless person is an unaccompanied disabled individual who has been continuously homeless for over one year  at least that's how the government defines it.   I met Rick near Times Square in New York City. Rick worked at the same job for 37 years  but after a stroke caused challenges  he lost his job and ran out of money. He has been turned down for disability so that leaves him out on the streets.   Rick has been homeless for 3 months. Most of the support for fighting homelessness is targeting to chronic homeless. But according to HUD you have to be homeless for longer than a year to qualify.      .Distributed by OneLoad.com,HER,video
Maria and her fiancee ended up losing their apartment because of a high utility bill. The day I met Maria  they had been living in a Sacramento tent city for three days. They were 'camping' on the streets but received a ticket for being homeless. Since this interview everyone in this tent city has been evicted.   Maria share with us what a day is like being homeless. They get up early to go to a park and get a lunch ticket. They split up to go to different homeless services for showers. Basically  their whole day is filled just trying to survive.   Maria's 1st wish was for her unborn baby. She's living homeless three months pregnant. She says they are moving into a new place.

"Jeannie went to jail this morning for not leaving camp. Many stayed at SafeGround Pilgrimage church last night. No church tonight" ~ [http://bit.ly/wsQqzz]  This past week Jeannie and Eli [http://bit.ly/AzJIik] were arrested in Sacramento for being homeless. They lived along with about 125 other homeless people in an organized tent community called Safe Ground [http://www.safegroundsac.org]  Jeannie worked as an in-home nurse. She lost her job and her place to live on the same day. Since April she has been living in a tent in Sacramento.  Kind of ironic Jeannie talks about the city counsel changes needed and the prospects of Sacramento allowing the campers to have a place to live is only days before they were forced to move.   The old hippie in me loves the self-governing tent city model  but really the only reason a tent community even exists is because homeless services has failed to provide adequate support.

"Police have come full force to Safe Ground & surrounding camps. Eviction eminent. There is nowhere for them to go. Shelters full." ~ @SafeGroundSac [http://bit.ly/tplNN8]  It's really hard to explain the feeling of powerlessness I felt today. But I guarantee my feelings don't even compare to the feelings of desperation my friends had while police were evicting them from their tents today.

Eli had his own business doing building remodeling and was an associate minister at a church for over 20 years. Because of the economy he lost everything  and when he shares about losing his books and jazz records I can feel his pain. I hope you can  too!   "When we had jobs we were important. When we had homes we were important. When we had cars we were important. When we had bank accounts we were important" ~ Eli   Trust me  Eli's interview is very powerful. Please watch it in it's entirety. Near the end  when Eli talks about rest being his 3rd wish  and that police keep threatening the campers with arrests  know that Eli stood up for what he believes and went to jail today.

Jordan is only 19 years-old and lives in a tent city in Sacramento  California. He says the only problems he has is being cold  and not being used to homelessness. Of course  there is also the eviction notice Sacramento Police left for the tent community the day I was visiting.   The good news is  Jordan is going to college. You can tell by his smile he has a bright future.   Jordan was lucky that he found Safe Ground. He feels like he has a home again. Sure wish the City of Sacramento would let them all keep their "homes".   Interesting  Jordan's second wish was to just understand why the police keep evicting the tent city and force them to move. I'd like to understand that too.

I met Ron in St Louis  Missouri. Ron was living with his nephew and then his SSI disability payments were stopped. The only way he could fight to get them back was with a lawyer  and because he didn't have money for legal help Ron ended up homeless.  Please forgive me but I am about to go into a little rant. At the time of this interview Ron lived in a shelter that is 10 days in and 30 days out. That means after staying there 10 days you are kicked out and cannot return until a 30 days period! THAT IS STUPID! No one can get their life back in 10 days  or 30 days even. I know of a shelter in Anchorage  Alaska that is 30 days in and 30 days out. Imagine you lose your job and then your apartment. It's winter time and you go into a shelter. If you cannot find a new job and come up with a months rent and security deposit within 10 days  or 30 days  you are kicked out in to the cold weather.  Shelters that run policies like this will tell you it's to motivate people to find work and a place to stay. But the real truth is it's money. This type shelter does little to get people out of their crisis and actually perpetuates homelessness. Although I am a big supporter of housing first model  there is still need for shelters  but this type shelter system makes no logical sense and much change if we are to have any impact on ending homelessness.  Ron is 65 years-old and is spending his retirement years homeless. Sadly  we are going to see more seniors on the streets as the 'boomer generation' gets older. Without savings  assets or healthcare  this will tax our social services system to the crisis level  yet no one is walking about it.  // more stories http://invisiblepeople.tv // follow http://twitter.com/invisiblepeople // follow http://twitter.com/hardlynormal,HER,video
I was walking in a park near downtown Ottawa  Canada  and started to talk to a small group of homeless people sitting on the lawn. Everyone started to talk about the recent street violence of homeless people being attacked for no reason. John (not his real name) showed me photos he took on his cellphone of a blood stained sidewalk after a 60 year-old man was viciously beaten. Another homeless man a few years back was set on fire.  Last few years violence against homeless people has been increasing at an alarming rate in North America. Just today  I was driving one of the most gentle men I have ever met  a kind homeless man in his 60s  who told me about where he can and cannot sleep on the streets. At one point  about a year ago  I found this gentle man after he was released from the hospital. His entire body was black and blue. I have never seen anyone beat up so bad. A few kids beat him so bad he was in the hospital for four days.  We need to stop violence on homeless people. Hate crime legislation is on and off again  and I am not really sure that is the solution. I believe we need more education so today's youth see homeless people as people. This website helps  but there is so much more work to be done.  John is an educated man from a good family  but developed addictions. I admire the courage he has to be open and honest with himself. I sure hope John got that apartment and is working towards sobriety. I am proof that people change for the better.  // more stories http://invisiblepeople.tv // follow http://twitter.com/invisiblepeople // follow http://twitter.com/hardlynormal,HER,video

This hotel is one of the better ones  and a wonderful man named Paul Kruse arranges for churches to bring in food and diapers.  Many of the affordable  weekly rate hotels are run down. Most places are filled with drug dealers  criminal activity and are unfit for children. It's a vicious cycle of homelessness because while paying to stay at these hotels it's nearly impossible to save for first and last months rent to get out of the situation.  This is the homelessness you don't see.

This is the homeless you don't see but need to see. I met Marlo in a weekly rate hotel in Albuquerque  New Mexico. The whole family  two adults and four children  live in a small hotel room.  Marlo says there are days she does not even want to wake up. From hotel to hotel then shelter to hotel and back. Families with low and no income get caught in a vicious cycle of nonstop crisis.  One thing Marlo says in this interview I hope you hear loud and clear. She is trying to potty train her youngest kids early because diapers are so expensive. My friend Lisa who founded Help a Mother Out [helpamotherout.org] educated me on how social assistance doesn't pay for diapers. Later when I started working with homeless families I saw first-hand how badly low-income families need diapers. Marlo mentions she was almost arrested for panhandling trying to get diapers for her children. Please support your local diaper bank and the Diaper Act [http://helpamotherout.org/diaperact]  Special thanks to Joy Junction [http://joyjunction.org]  // more stories http://invisiblepeople.tv // follow http://twitter.com/invisiblepeople // follow http://twitter.com/hardlynormal,HER,video
