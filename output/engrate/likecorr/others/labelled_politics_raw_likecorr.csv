In response to the Pope:  If and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS  which as everyone knows is ISIS’s ultimate trophy  I can promise you that the Pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been President because this would not have happened. ISIS would have been eradicated unlike what is happening now with our all talk  no action politicians.   The Mexican government and its leadership has made many disparaging remarks about me to the Pope  because they want to continue to rip off the United States  both on trade and at the border  and they understand I am totally wise to them. The Pope only heard one side of the story - he didn’t see the crime  the drug trafficking and the negative economic impact the current policies have on the United States. He doesn’t see how Mexican leadership is outsmarting President Obama and our leadership in every aspect of negotiation.   For a religious leader to question a person’s faith is disgraceful. I am proud to be a Christian and as President I will not allow Christianity to be consistently attacked and weakened  unlike what is happening now  with our current President. No leader  especially a religious leader  should have the right to question another man’s religion or faith. They are using the Pope as a pawn and they should be ashamed of themselves for doing so  especially when so many lives are involved and when illegal immigration is so rampant.  Donald J. Trump,HER,status

I totally disagree with the FOX statement. I do not think Megyn Kelly is a quality journalist. I think her questioning of me  despite all of the polls saying I won the debate  was very unfair. Hopefully in the future I will be proven wrong and she will be able to elevate her standards to a level of professionalism that a network such as FOX deserves.   More importantly  I am very pleased to see the latest polls from Public Policy Polling showing me at a strong number one with 35% in New Hampshire  the Monmouth University poll showing me  again at number one  with 30% in South Carolina and the latest national poll from Gravis where I am again the clear front runner with 40%. It was also just announced that I won the prestigious corn kernel poll at the Iowa State Fair by a landslide.

Donald J. Trump Orders Flags to be flown at Half-Staff at all Trump Properties in Honor of the Five Fallen Soldiers  Mr. Trump Takes Action and Shows Commitment to Military and Vets  (New York  NY) July 20th  2015- Today Donald J. Trump has ordered all flags at Trump properties around the country to be flown at half-staff in honor of the five fallen soldiers who were tragically killed in last week's shooting. Mr. Trump has long been a dedicated supporter of our military and our Veterans and if the President won't act  he will.  Mr. Trump stated  "This disgraceful omission is unacceptable and yet another example of our incompetent politicians. It is a simple yet meaningful and important gesture that signifies our respect and recognition for these great soldiers who lost their lives. We must do better for all Americans  especially our military. We must Make America Great Again!"  In addition to the lowering of the flags  Mr. Trump has established a hotline (855- VETS- 352) and email address (veterans@donaldtrump.com) for Veterans to share their stories about the need to reform our Veterans Administration.  If he is elected President he will take care of these and all Veteran complaints very quickly and efficiently like a world-class business man can do  but a politician has no clue.,HER,status
I am not at all surprised by the Des Moines Register's sophomoric editorial. It was issued immediately after the release of the ABC News/Washington Post poll showing me with 24% and an eleven-point lead over my nearest rival. As one of the most liberal newspapers in the United States  the poll results were just too much for them to bear. The Des Moines Register has lost much circulation  advertising  and power over the last number of years. They will do anything for a headline  and this poorly written "non-endorsement" got them some desperately needed ink.   On the campaign trail in Iowa  a state whose people I have truly gotten to know and love  I have been treated very badly by the Des Moines Register. They were uneven and inconsistent  but far more importantly  very dishonest. They would rarely write the facts or report what really took place. They never captured the energy of each event and it is a constant battle with them by my representatives to get an accurate count of the large crowds I draw. They know the very impressive numbers and either reduce them or don't report them at all. It is always wonderful to have the support of a newspaper  even a failing one  but this has only given me more motivation to fight harder in Iowa and Make America Great Again!,HER,status

It's a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care and one of our Veterans that has served our country is put on a waiting list and gets no care.,HER,status
I am not a fan of John McCain because he has done so little for our Veterans and he should know better than anybody what the Veterans need  especially in regards to the VA. He is yet another all talk  no action politician who spends too much time on television and not enough time doing his job and helping the Vets. He is also allowing our military to decrease substantially in size and strength  something which should never be allowed to happen.  Furthermore  he was extremely disrespectful to the thousands upon thousands of people  many of whom happen to be his constituents  that came to listen to me speak about illegal immigration in Phoenix last week by calling them "crazies".  These were not "crazies"---these were great American citizens.  I have great respect for all those who serve in our military including those that weren't captured and are also heroes.  I want to strengthen our military and take care of our Veterans.  I want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN especially for those that serve to protect our freedom. I am fighting for our Veterans!,HER,status
Donald J. Trump Response to Huffington Post   Mr. Trump is number one in the unimportant Huffington Post poll  along with all other recently released polls including Reuters  FOX  USA Today/Suffolk University and The Economist.   Mr. Trump is in first place in Nevada  where he is also number one  by a wide margin  with Hispanics. He is number one in North Carolina and expects to win Iowa and New Hampshire.   Mr. Trump singlehandedly raised the issue of illegal immigration and started a national conversation about what has turned out to be one of the most important topics of this election cycle.   Likewise  Mr. Trump is the leader on issues such as the terrible United States trade deals  strengthening our military  taking care of our great Vets and the repeal and replacement of Obamacare.   If you read previously written Tweets  Mr. Trump has never been a fan of Arianna Huffington or the money-losing Huffington Post.   The only clown show in this scenario is the Huffington Post pretending to be a legitimate news source. Mr. Trump is not focused on being covered by a glorified blog. He is focused on Making America Great Again.,HER,status

Failing candidate Hillary Clinton  who is desperately trying to hold on to her lead in the democratic primary against Bernie Sanders  is knowingly putting out lies about my stance on illegal immigration. I said “Mexico is sending”--- I’m not knocking immigration or immigrants  but rather am very critical of the country of Mexico for sending us people that they don’t want. Likewise I am very critical of illegal immigration and the tremendous problems including crime  which it causes.   She is desperate  she is sad  and she is obviously very nervous when she has to revert to issues that have already been settled given the absolute accuracy of my statement. She speaks about “my tone” and that’s the problem with our country’s leaders. They are more worried about tone than results! It’s not about being nice--- it’s about being competent.   Hillary should spend more time producing her illegally hidden emails and less time trying to obfuscate a statement by me that is totally clear and obviously very much accepted by the public as true. I am honored  however  that she is attacking me  instead of Jeb Bush. Obviously she knows that JEB is no longer her real competition. The last person she wants to face is Donald Trump.,HER,status

Mr. Trump believes that Hillary Clinton has lost all credibility when she blames him for the horrible incident in South Carolina. Why would Mrs. Clinton attack Donald Trump for something that he has nothing to do with?   Mr. Trump continues to send his prayers and condolences to the people of South Carolina. In light of the tragedy  Mr. Trump also cancelled a sold out campaign event.   At this time of national sorrow  a responsible leader should be focused on uniting and healing the country.   Mr. Trump believes that Hillary Clinton does not have any credibility when she blames words for violence. This is the same politician who lied to the world after she failed to take proper steps to secure the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi and falsely blamed the radical Islamic attack on a YouTube video. This is the same person who illegally deleted her emails after getting a subpoena from the U.S. Congress.   It is totally inappropriate for Mrs. Clinton to exploit this terrible tragedy and use it as an opportunity to attack Donald Trump. She must be nervous about something.,HER,status

We put 16.1 million men in uniform in the various armed services  invaded Africa  invaded Sicily and Italy  won the battle for the Atlantic  planned and executed D-Day  marched across the Pacific and Europe  developed the atomic bomb and ultimately conquered Japan and Germany.

If you follow Obama administration actions this summer  you see it's their "Summer of the Flag". They seek to ban some flags  light up our White House in controversial colors of others  inexplicably wave the white flag retreating from Iran's terrorist regime  and today actually raised the flag of a communist nation in the halls of our US State Department. Why then is it impossible for this Commander in Chief to honor our fallen military heroes following last week's terrorist murder spree in Chattanooga? He did so after evil attacks on Americans in Aurora  CO and Newtown  CT - so why not now  Mr. President? Why not our troops?  Demand he do so! Whether you agree with me or not on other issues  please join this effort. If you don't stand for something you'll fall for anything  and this IS something to stand for!  President Obama - we shouldn't even have to tell you  but lower the flags. It is the sign of respect. Include our White House flag  for honoring our fallen who were killed on their Chattanooga base where they're working and sacrificing for all of us - including you.,HER,link
Congratulations  Prime Minister Netanyahu. Thank you to the good people of Israel for supporting a leader who will stand up and fight for all the free world while other leaders sit down.

Dear PETA   Chill. At least Trig didn’t eat the dog.   Hey  by the way  remember your “Woman of the Year”  Ellen DeGeneres? Did you get all wee-wee’d up when she posted this sweet picture? http://conservatives4palin.com/2015/01/peta-woman-year-posts-photo-child-standing-dog.html Hypocritical  much?  Did you go as crazy when your heroic Man-of-Your-Lifetime  Barack Obama  revealed he actually enjoyed eating dead dog meat?  Aren’t you the double-standard radicals always opposing Alaska’s Iditarod – the Last Great Race honoring dogs who are born to run in wide open spaces  while some of your pets “thrive” in a concrete jungle where they’re allowed outdoors to breathe and pee maybe once a day? (http://iditarod.com/ http://www.irondog.org/)  Aren’t you the same herd that opposes our commercial fishing jobs  claiming I encourage slaying and consuming wild  organic healthy protein sources called “fish”? (I do.)   Aren’t you the same anti-beef screamers blogging hate from your comfy leather office chairs  wrapped in your fashionable leather belts above your kickin’ new leather pumps you bought because your celebrity idols (who sport fur and crocodile purses) grinned in a tabloid wearing the exact same Louboutins exiting sleek cowhide covered limo seats on their way to some liberal fundraiser shindig at some sushi bar that features poor dead smelly roe (that I used to strip from our Bristol Bay-caught fish  and in a Dillingham cannery I packed those castoff fish eggs for you while laughing with co-workers about the suckers paying absurdly high prices to party with the throw away parts of our wild seafood)? I believe you call those discarded funky eggs “caviar”.  Yeah  you’re real credible on this  PETA. A shame  because I’ll bet we agree on what I hope is the true meaning of your mission – respecting God’s creation and critters.   Our pets  including Trig’s best buddy Jill Hadassah  are loved  spoiled and cared for more than some people care for their fellow man whose politics may not mesh with nonsensical liberally failed ways or don’t fit your flighty standards.  Jill is a precious part of our world. So is Trig.  - Sarah Palin,HER,photo

I don’t believe America has ever seen such a thing. The leader of the free world just followed Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu’s honest  visionary  and serious U.N. speech with a speech of his own in the Rose Garden. More like it  President Obama just recorded essentially an infomercial on the disastrous Obamacare rollout. In a speech full of unserious claims and low-level false accusations against those who disagree with his liberal  unworkable policies  this president engaged in doublespeak without even blinking. It was unreal.   Obama just proclaimed all our predictions about Obamacare were wrong. The economy is doing great  he claimed  though he dare not direct that to the millions of people who are being kicked to part-time employment  to bankrupt cities  to shuttered Main Street businesses  and to conscientious taxpayers suffocating under a $17 trillion debt.  Obama just claimed for the umpteenth time there will be no health care rationing (aka “death panels”)  but apparently Howard Dean  Paul Krugman  and Obama’s own former director of Medicare and Medicaid (and anyone who read the IPAB section of the monstrous bill) didn’t get the memo on that one.  Obama just claimed that the last government “shutdown” in 1996 hurt the economy  when in fact he knows the stock market boomed. I guess he thinks he can furlough reality too. He’s also claiming that he cut deficits in half. In what alternate universe? And if that’s the case  then why does he insist on yet another enormous debt ceiling increase?  The White House is now condescendingly comparing Obamacare’s numerous “glitches” to Apple software updates. The difference is we can CHOOSE to buy Apple products; no one forces us. Obviously the comparison is ridiculously unserious as we find out the harsh  life-changing punishments this new arm of the IRS will hit us with if we don’t buy Obama’s forced product.  Among so many other distorted things  Obama just declared that “Obamacare is open for business” – well  aside from all the “glitches” I guess. His infomercial sent people to broken websites and a hotline that seems permanently on hold. And this same bureaucracy will now be in charge of our health care  which is 1/6th of our economy. Nah  surely nothing could go wrong with that.  The majority of Americans are against Obamacare despite all of the rhetoric fed into Obama’s teleprompter. And amazingly  of course  Obama blamed fiscal conservatives and tea party patriots for the problems and even for this partial government shut down that he and Harry Reid drove. He declared he would NOT negotiate a solution with them  but then in the next breath he said he’s open to hearing from anyone with a better idea. Doublespeak.  Bottom line  sadly our president passes the buck and cries that he has no responsibility in all of this. He acted as if he  the leader  didn’t have any responsibility to pass a budget either – even during his first two years in office when he enjoyed total Democrat control of Congress and the White House.  What a difference in leadership style and substance we witnessed today on U.S. soil. The two speeches said it all. A Warrior unifying his nation and their allies  and a Community Organizer un-organizing and dividing his own.  - Sarah Palin,HER,status

Who is running our country? We've got a CIA Director sharing security info with his mistress using an unsecure gmail account. We've got the delusional Susan Rice blaming the death of an ambassador on a Youtube video. We've got Iran firing on one of our drones a week before the election. We've got the White House either ignorant of or covering up all of this. Who is minding the store? Everywhere we look we see the rank incompetence or corruption of the people who are supposedly running our country and our major institutions. Let's hope that responsible reporters at Obama's press conference today ask the right questions Americans deserve answers to.   Here's my question for the president: As our nation's chief executive you claim to be unaware of the most important and tragic situations we're facing; so  as a former chief executive  I'd like to know how long it takes for your staff to tell you things like: "Sir  your CIA Director is under investigation"?  - Sarah Palin,HER,status

Apparently President Obama can’t see Egypt and Libya from his house. On the anniversary of the worst terrorist attacks ever perpetrated on America  our embassy in Cairo and our consulate in Benghazi were attacked by violent Islamic mobs. In Cairo  they scaled the walls of our embassy  destroyed our flag  and replaced it with a black Islamic banner. In Benghazi  the armed gunmen set fire to our consulate and killed an American staff member. The Islamic radicals claim that these attacks are in protest to some film criticizing Islam. In response to this  the U.S. embassy in Cairo issued a statement that was so outrageous many of us thought it must be a satire. The embassy actually apologized to the violent mob attacking us  and it even went so far as to chastise those who use free speech to “hurt the religious feelings of Muslims.” (Funny  the current administration has no problem hurting the “religious feelings” of Catholics.)   But where is the president’s statement about this? These countries represent his much touted “Arab Spring.” How’s that Arab Spring working out for us now? Have we received an apology yet from our “friends” in the Muslim Brotherhood for the assault on our embassy?    It’s about time our president stood up for America and condemned these Islamic extremists. I realize there must be a lot on his mind these days – what with our economy’s abysmal jobless numbers and Moody’s new warning about yet another downgrade to our nation’s credit rating due to the current administration’s failure to come up with a credible deficit reduction plan. And  of course  he has a busy schedule – with all those rounds of golf  softball interviews with the “Pimp with the Limp ” and fundraising dinners with his corporate cronies. But our nation’s security should be of utmost importance to our Commander-in-chief. America can’t afford any more “leading from behind” in such a dangerous world. We already know that President Obama likes to “speak softly” to our enemies. If he doesn’t have a “big stick” to carry  maybe it’s time for him to grow one.  - Sarah Palin,HER,status

My Republican colleagues talk a lot about “family values.” Well  let me be very clear. It is not a family value to force the mother of a newborn baby to go back to work a few days after she gives birth  because she doesn’t have the money to stay home and bond with her baby. That is not a family value. That is an insult to everything that I know about what family is about.,HER,status

I think – and I say this straightforwardly – I think Donald Trump is a pathological liar. I think much of what he says are lies or gross distortion of reality. And what somebody like a Donald Trump is doing is playing on the fears and anxieties of the American people. And people are afraid. But instead of having a rational discussion about how we rebuild the middle class  what Trump is saying is it's all the Muslims' fault  it's all the Mexicans' fault.,HER,video
I'll tell you what does worry me. Ever since Trump has been opening his mouth  you're seeing all these bitter people  latent racists who are becoming emboldened. You're seeing some ugly stuff happening around this country.  What we have got to do immediately is to say that racism and xenophobia are totally unacceptable and we will stand with Muslims and undocumented people in this country. We can't allow racism and xenophobia to gain traction.,HER,status

In my view  now is the time for developing a serious and effective approach to destroy ISIS. Now is not the time for taking cheap political advantage of this tragedy. Now is the time – as President Obama is trying to do – to unite the world in an organized campaign against ISIS that will eliminate the stain of ISIS from this world.  But let me also say that now is not the time for demagoguery and fear mongering. What terrorism is about is trying to instill terror and fear into the hearts of people. And we will not let that happen. We will not be terrorized or live in fear. During these difficult times  we will not succumb to Islamophobia. We will not turn our backs on the refugees who are fleeing Syria and Afghanistan. We will do what we do best and that is be Americans – fighting racism  fighting xenophobia  fighting fear.,HER,status

As a nation  we must do everything we can to put an end to this awful epidemic of senseless slaughter.  We need a comprehensive approach.

We must greatly expand and improve our mental health capabilities so individuals and families can get the psychological help they need when they need it. We also have to tone down the incredibly high level of gratuitous violence which permeates our media.  The shouting at each other must end. The hard work of developing good policy must begin.,HER,status

Pope Francis is not just asking us to alleviate poverty and move toward more a equitable distribution of wealth and income.

He is asking us to become a different kind of person  where our happiness and well-being comes from serving others and being part of the human community - not by spending our lives accumulating more and more wealth and power while oppressing others.,HER,status

Bernie Sanders’ New Title: Dealmaker:   Sen. Bernard Sanders didn’t seem a likely suspect to bridge Washington’s toxic partisan divide and cut one of the most significant deals in years.  But the Senate’s lone socialist and a potential 2016 presidential candidate did just that — negotiating a deal over the weekend to tackle wait times at the Department of Veterans Affairs and clear his biggest legislative test since he took over the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee gavel last year.  The Vermont independent’s compromise with House Veterans’ Affairs Chairman Jeff Miller  R-Fla.  would provide $17 billion to the agency with $5 billion offset with savings and fees elsewhere. In a brief interview after a Monday news conference announcing the deal  Sanders reflected on the difficulty of the deal.  “I learned that it’s very  very  very hard; that there are a lot of moving parts; that there a lot of people you have to pay attention to ” he said. “In this case with the VA  the administration  the Democrats  with Republicans and a whole lot of individuals within those entities.

Bernie Sanders proposed legislation to bar companies that leave America from receiving federal contracts  The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal reported. “I have a message for these corporate deserters: You can’t be an American company only when you want corporate welfare from American taxpayers or you want lucrative contracts from the federal government ” Sanders said in the Burlington Free Press. “This is an absolute outrage. It really is ” Sanders said on WCAX-TV  which reported that Mylan Pharmaceuticals  a company with a plant in St. Albans  Vermont  is one of the latest companies to make a move merging with Abbott Laboratories and reincorporating in the Netherlands.

The Third Leading Cause of Death in the U.S.   Heart disease and cancer are the two leading causes of death in the United States.

An Attack on Workers:  The Supreme Court ruled against a union that had collected fees from workers who were not members but nevertheless benefited from better pay and working conditions that the union negotiated. The case decided on Monday involved home-care workers in Illinois whose hourly wages rose from $7 in 2003 to $13 in 2014. The workers also received health insurance paid for by the state and other benefits. The state and taxpayers benefited by paying less for home care than it would have cost to put people in expensive institutional care.  Sen. Bernie Sanders called the court decision “another attack on the rights of workers to collectively bargain for higher wages and decent benefits.” The decision by Justice Samuel Alito Jr.  and four other extreme right-wing Republicans “is another attack on the rights of workers to collectively bargain for higher wages and decent benefits.” It could have been worse  Sanders noted. The ruling did not go as far as some worker advocates had feared so other public-sector employees may still have an effective voice at the bargaining table.  Supreme Court analyst Jeffrey Toobin warned that it still could get worse. Writing for The New Yorker  Toobin said the conservative court has a pattern of first deciding a case in a “narrow” way but then using a decision as a precedent to move the law in a more dramatic  conservative direction in a subsequent case.,HER,photo

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Gas Prices: Sen. Bernie Sanders on Thursday introduced legislation to make federal regulators invoke emergency powers to stop speculators from taking advantage of turmoil in Iraq to drive up oil prices and make motorists pay more for gasoline  the Burlington Free Press and Los Angeles Times reported. “I am getting tired of big oil companies and Wall Street speculators using Iraq as an excuse to pump up oil and gas prices ” Sanders said.   VA Reform: Sen. Sanders  who is chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee  and Sen. John McCain led the push for Senate passage of VA reform measure that would let veterans visit civilian doctors in certain circumstances. But Sanders worries that allowing visits to physicians outside the system will lead to the privatization of veterans care. He told The Associated Press that the real problem is a 16 percent increase in patients cared for by the VA from 2008 to 2013.

Speculators Use Iraq to Drive Up Oil and Gas Prices:  Sen. Bernie Sanders accused oil companies and Wall Street speculators of using unrest in Iraq as a phony excuse to artificially drive up crude oil and gasoline prices. The price of oil rose on Thursday above $115 a barrel – a new nine-month high on the New York Mercantile Exchange – ostensibly because of concerns that sectarian violence in Iraq could cut off the country's exports. The price of regular gasoline rose to $3.67 a gallon on Thursday  up a nickel in the past month  according to gasbuddy.com. That was despite the fact that today there is more supply and less demand for gasoline than five years ago  when the average price of a gallon of gas was just $2.67 a gallon.

BREAKING: Senate Passes Sanders-McCain Veterans Bill:   The Senate today voted nearly unanimously for a bill to expand hospitals and clinics run by the Department of Veterans Affairs and to hire more doctors and nurses to provide timely  quality care for veterans.   The bipartisan bill by Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) would let veterans facing long delays for doctor appointments at VA facilities go elsewhere. Their measure also would hold VA officials accountable for trying to conceal patient wait times.  “Our job is to make certain that every veteran in the country gets quality health care in a timely manner ” Sanders said. “At a time when 2 million more veterans have come into the VA in the last four years  we must ensure that there are enough doctors  nurses and other health care professionals to meet the needs of veterans in every facility in the country.”  Read more here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-passes-sanders-mccain-veterans-bill #VA #Veterans #Vote4Vets ,HER,link

Bernie Sanders has called the “billionaire agenda.” Now Republicans are trying to silence Koch brother critics like Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.  So what are the Republicans trying to hide? It’s not well known  but David Koch was the 1980 Libertarian Party candidate for vice president. He campaigned on a platform that called for abolishing taxes on the wealthy and profitable corporations  shutting down Medicare and Medicaid  repealing Social Security  putting the Postal Service out of business and doing away with the minimum wage. “They want to repeal every major piece of legislation over the past 80 years that protects the middle class  the elderly  the children  the sick and the most vulnerable in our country ” Bernie said.

Princeton Study: U.S. No Longer An Actual Democracy - Brendan James  Talking Points Memo:   A new study from Princeton spells bad news for American democracy—namely  that it no longer exists.  Asking "[w]ho really rules?" researchers Martin Gilens and Benjamin I. Page argue that over the past few decades America's political system has slowly transformed from a democracy into an oligarchy  where wealthy elites wield most power.  Using data drawn from over 1 800 different policy initiatives from 1981 to 2002  the two conclude that rich  well-connected individuals on the political scene now steer the direction of the country  regardless of or even against the will of the majority of voters.  "The central point that emerges from our research is that economic elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on U.S. government policy " they write  "while mass-based interest groups and average citizens have little or no independent influence."  As one illustration  Gilens and Page compare the political preferences of Americans at the 50th income percentile to preferences of Americans at the 90th percentile as well as major lobbying or business groups. They find that the government—whether Republican or Democratic—more often follows the preferences of the latter group rather than the first.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  House Passes ‘Vulgar and Obscene’ Budget: House Republicans on Thursday passed a budget that would shower tax breaks on the wealthy and cut income tax rates on corporations while cutting support for seniors on Medicare and Social Security  families on Medicaid  children and seniors who rely on food stamps and college students struggling to afford tuition. In an interview with the Rev. Al Sharpton on MSNBC  Sen. Bernie Sanders called the budget “vulgar and obscene.”   High Court Ruling a Bonanza for Republicans: The Republican Party and the financial industry are primed to take advantage of the Supreme Court’s ruling that ended longstanding total limits on campaign contributions. According to a review of Federal Election Commission records  more than 71 percent of big-money donors give to Republicans and less than 26 percent to Democrats. Wall Street financiers are the biggest class of uber-wealthy donors. "We are rapidly on the road to oligarchy both economically and politically " Sen. Sanders told The Huffington Post. "A smaller and smaller number of very wealthy people now have more influence than ever before thanks to Citizens United and McCutcheon."   David Koch’s Radical Manifesto: In 1980  David Koch ran for vice president on the Libertarian Party ticket. According to information provided by Sen. Sanders' press office on Thursday  the platform consisted of dozens of odious positions from abolishing Social Security  Medicare and Medicaid to getting rid of campaign funding limits  according to a Daily Kos post. David and Charles Koch today are among the richest billionaires in the world and the biggest benefactors of Republican candidates and causes.   Veterans Award for Sanders: Sen.

A Ruling for the Rich and Republicans: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/a-ruling-for-the-rich,HER,photo
The Week in Review:  The Supreme Court on Wednesday handed the wealthy more power to spend more money and have more influence on who wins elections. After a very rocky rollout  there were very impressive results by a midnight Monday deadline when more than 7 million Americans signed up for health care under the Affordable Care Act. The March jobs report issued Friday by the Labor Department showed the number of Americans out of work six months or more is twice as high as before the recession began in 2007. The latest jobless numbers bolster the case for Congress to extend benefits that expired late last for the long-term unemployed.  Continue reading: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/the-week-in-review-040414,HER,photo
Real Unemployment at 12.7%:  The official unemployment rate for March was 6.7 percent  unchanged from February  but real unemployment ticked up to 12.7 percent  the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced on Friday. That number counts workers forced to settle for part-time jobs and those unemployed for so long that they have given up looking for work. The Senate is expected to vote Monday to resurrect benefits that expired last Dec. 28 for the long-term jobless. “This will impact several million American workers who are at the end of their ropes financially ” Sanders said. Passing the bill is “the morally right thing to do” and “good economics ” the senator added  but he cautioned that the measure faces an uncertain fate in the Republican-run House.  This bill to extend long-term emergency unemployment benefits for 2.2 million Americans would restore benefits that expired nearly three months ago.The benefits  about $300 a week on average  help jobless workers fill up their gas tank to get to a job interview  feed their families  pay the rent and heat their homes.  Each  week that the Congress fails to act  an additional 72 000 Americans are losing their unemployment benefits. Today  about 4 million Americans who are currently looking for a job have been unemployed for more than 6 months. In the wake of a slow recovery from the recession that began in 2007  long-term unemployment is near a 60-year high.  House Speaker John Boehner and other Republicans today oppose extending the benefits  but when George W. Bush was President  Republicans  including Boehner  voted for emergency unemployment benefits five times  Now that Barack Obama is in the White House  many congressional Republicans oppose extending these benefits. Since 1958  Congress has never failed to pass emergency unemployment benefits when long-term unemployment has been as high as it is today. Today  there are nearly three job applicants for every one job opening.  There simply aren’t enough jobs out there for the more than 10 million Americans who are actively seeking work.  The long-term unemployment rate today is more than double what it’s been at any other time Congress has let emergency jobless assistance expire. For example  hundreds of people applied last month to work at a Sam’s Club in Oxford  Ala.  that won’t be opening until August. In January  more than 5 000 people waited in line for just 1 500 jobs at an outlet mall in Palm Beach  Fla. That same month  1 600 people in Hagerstown  Md.  applied for just 36 job openings at a dairy farm to process milk and ice cream. Last December  10 000 people applied for just 750 flight attendant jobs at Southwest Airlines and more than 23 000 Americans applied for just 600 jobs at Wal-Mart in Washington  DC.  If Congress fails to extend emergency unemployment benefits  240 000 American workers will lose their jobs by the end of this year. The overall economy will be hurt because when people lose their unemployment benefits  they don’t go to the grocery store  they don’t buy clothes  they don’t go to the pharmacy.  Businesses lose customers  they lose money  and they fire even more people.,HER,photo

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Supreme Court Rules for the Rich: Sen. Bernie Sanders denounced a 5-4 Supreme Court ruling on Wednesday that fundamentally undermines American democracy by striking down limits on total donations that individuals may make to political candidates and parties  the Burlington Free Press  Moyers & Company and London’s Daily Mail reported. “These five justices are working night and day to make the wealth and powerful more wealthy and more powerful ” Sanders told nationally syndicated radio host Leslie Marshall. We have to be careful that we do not let this great country … become a plutocracy or an oligarchy. That  frankly  is the direction that we are moving ” Sanders said in a Senate speech shown on WFFF-TV and WVYN-TV.  Democracy Now!: Sen. Sanders said the Supreme Court’s ruling only offers “freedom” to a handful of wealthy donors who can afford to dump more than $125 000 into campaigns. “For them to plop a few billion dollars into the political process ” Sen. Sanders told Amy Goodman in a Thursday morning interview for Democracy Now! “It’s just an outrage… I suspect in the next presidential campaign  the Koch brothers themselves will spend a billion dollars to elect the candidate of their choice.”  Court Commentary: The decision elicited strong disapproval from a host of Democrats and liberals. President Barack Obama  a spokesman said  was “disappointed ” and Sen. Sanders predicted that henceforth  “billionaires like the Koch brothers and Sheldon Adelson will control our political process ” according to a Chicago Tribune editorial. “Freedom of speech  in my view  does not mean the freedom to buy the United States government ” Sen. Sanders said in a Rutland Herald and Times Argus editorial. Writing for Politico  National Review editor Rich Lowry didn’t like the way “Sanders natters on about the decision creating ‘an oligarchic form of society.’”  Oligarchs and Plutocrats: An oligarchy is a system of "government by the few." Rooted in Greek  oligos means "few" and arch means "rule " as in monarch or hierarchy. Plutocracy has been used in English since the middle of the 17th century to refer to the rule or power of the wealthy. Pluto comes from the Greek for "wealth."

High Court Gives Big Money More Say in Campaigns:  The Supreme Court on Wednesday struck down overall campaign contribution limits. The law that the 5-4 ruling voided has prevented individuals from contributing more than $123 000 to candidates and party committees per election cycle. Sen. Bernie Sanders  who has proposed a constitutional amendment to restore the power of Congress and state lawmakers to limit campaign donations  blasted the ruling.“Freedom of speech  in my view  does not mean the freedom to buy the United States government ” Sanders said.  The ruling gives wealthy donors like the billionaires Charles and David Koch more power to influence elections. An earlier ruling in Citizens United vs. FEC resulted in a record $7 billion being spent in the 2012 election cycle  including at least $400 million by the Koch brothers alone. “What world are the five conservative Supreme Court justices living in?” Sanders asked. “To equate the ability of billionaires to buy elections with ‘freedom of speech’ is totally absurd. The Supreme Court is paving the way toward an oligarchic form of society in which a handful of billionaires like the Koch brothers and Sheldon Adelson will control our political process.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/high-court-gives-big-money-more-say-in-campaigns #McCutcheon,HER,photo

A Very Ugly Moment:  “What kind of nation are we when we give tax breaks to millionaires but we can’t take care of the elderly and the children?” Sen. Bernie Sanders asked on Monday. He was reacting to a new report that more than 18  percent of Americans last year struggled to afford food. Republicans in Congress  meanwhile  are calling for deeper and deeper cuts in food stamps  a program that provides help mostly to children and seniors.  We are living in “a very ugly moment ” the senator told the Rev. Al Sharpton.,HER,video

Working Overtime:  President Barack Obama on Thursday called for new overtime rules so more workers will be eligible for time-and-a-half pay after putting in a 40-hour workweek. Obama’s directive to the Labor Department eventually will help millions of low-wage workers. Now  a worker on  salary of more than $455 a week with minimal management duties may be denied overtime.  Sen. Bernie Sanders applauded the president’s action. “It is absurd that millions of workers making as little as $455 a week are considered ‘supervisors’ and get no overtime pay.  I hope the Department of Labor raises that threshold to at least $1 000  which would reflect inflation since 1975. That step alone would mean a raise for millions of workers. More money in the hands of working people would mean that those workers could then go out and make purchases that would help create more jobs.”  It will take a while before workers see any more money in their paychecks. Leaving the details to be worked out by the Labor Department  Obama did not specify what the new salary thresholds should be. The department isn’t likely to propose specific language until this fall.  Workers won the right to overtime pay back in 1938  when Congress passed a law requiring extra pay for extra hours of work. Under the law  the Labor Department was given the authority to change the salary thresholds to account for inflation. The department also was given leeway to spell out which workers are eligible for overtime. The last time the rules were updated  however  was 1975. That’s when the Ford administration raised the salary threshold significantly to account for inflation.,HER,photo
Childhood Poverty in America:  The childhood poverty rate in the United States is greater than in any other major country. So as senators on Wednesday worked on a bill that would reauthorize a federal child care block grant  Sen. Bernie Sanders proposed an  amendment calling on President Barack Obama to submit a five-year plan to reduce childhood poverty. “The United States of America is the richest country in the history of the world. Unfortunately  despite our great wealth  more of our citizens are living in poverty than ever before and we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country in the industrialized world. We have a moral responsibility to end childhood poverty in America ” Sanders said.  Read more: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/childhood-poverty-in-america,HER,photo
What the U.S. Can Learn About Health Care from Other Countries:  Other major countries offer better health care at less cost than the United States  according to witnesses who testified on Tuesday at a Senate hearing chaired by Sen. Bernie Sanders. “What this hearing is really about is two fundamental issues. First  the U.S.  the wealthiest country on the planet  is the only major industrialized country in the world that does not guarantee health care as a right to its citizens. Should we consider joining the rest of the world? I’d argue we should ” Sanders said. “Second  the U.S. spends twice as much as other countries that have much better health outcomes. What can we learn from these countries?” asked Sanders  chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Primary Health and Aging.

There's No Need to End Saturday Mail Delivery - Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   The U.S. Postal Service is one of our most popular and important government agencies. It provides universal service six days a week to every corner of America  no matter how small or remote. It supports millions of jobs in virtually every other sector of our economy. It provides decent-paying union jobs to some 500 000 Americans  and it is the largest employer of veterans.  Whether you are a low-income elderly woman living at the end of a dirt road in Vermont or a wealthy CEO living on Park Avenue  you get your mail six days a week. And you pay for this service at a cost far less than anywhere else in the industrialized world.  Yet the Postal Service is under constant and vicious attack. Why? The answer is simple. There are very powerful and wealthy special interests who want to privatize or dismember virtually every function that government now performs  whether it is Social Security  Medicare  public education or the Postal Service. They see an opportunity for Wall Street and corporate America to make billions in profits out of these services  and couldn't care less how privatization or a degradation of services affects ordinary Americans.

The Kochs are against extending emergency unemployment benefits.  “It causes employers to face higher taxes  too  which discourages them from hiring new employees.”  Read more.  4. The Kochs spent $400 million on misleading attack ads in the last election cycle.  “A labyrinth of tax-exempt groups and limited-liability companies helps mask the sources of the money  much of which went to voter mobilization and television ads attacking President Obama and congressional Democrats  according to tax filings and campaign finance reports.”  Read more.  5.

Republicans Again Block Help for Long-Term Unemployed: A bill to revive benefits for the long-term unemployed was blocked on Thursday by Senate Republicans. The proposed three-month extension of the jobless-aid program  which expired Dec. 28  was supported by Sen. Bernie Sanders and all of the other members of the Democratic caucus. Only four Republican senators supported the measure. One more vote would have provided the 60 needed under Senate rules to advance the bill.

A Monday evening vigil outside the White House was among more than 200 demonstrations planned across the country by leading environmentalists opposed to construction of Canada’s controversial tar sands oil pipeline. President Obama will have the final say on whether to allow building the 1 200 mile pipeline to ship 830 000 barrels a day of the dirty crude oil from Alberta to refineries in Texas along the Gulf of Mexico coast.  An environmental impact study released on Friday discounted the increase in greenhouse gas emissions that would result from extracting and refining more of the dirtiest form of crude oil on the planet. Sen. Bernie Sanders said the report “turned a blind eye to the ugly reality” that expanded drilling in the tar sands region would contribute to global warming. President Obama should block construction of the pipeline  Sanders said  to avoid contributing to “the most serious environmental crisis facing the world today.” In addition to the vigil outside the White House  another was planned Monday evening in New York featuring 350.org co-founder Bill McKibben. The Vermont-based McKibben’s 350.org helped organize the vigils along with CREDO  the Sierra Club  Rainforest Action Network and other organizations.,HER,photo

Long-Term Unemployment:  More than 1.3 million Americans without jobs for six months or more face an unemployment insurance cutoff at the end of December. As the impact continues to be felt from worst recession since the 1930s  Sen. Bernie Sanders joined 31 other senators who signed a letter urging Congress to preserve federal unemployment insurance for another year.  While the official 7 percent unemployment rate in November was the lowest in five years  long-term unemployment remained near record highs. Altogether some 4 million Americans  more than one-third of all those who are unemployed  have been jobless for six months or more.   The immediate threat affects about 1.3 million workers who would lose benefits if Congress lets an emergency program expire in the days after Christmas. Another 1.9 million would have their benefits cut later in the year. (Some 600 Vermonters face an immediate cutoff after Dec. 28  and 2 300 more Vermonters could lose benefits later in 2014  according to the National Employment Law Project.) A new study by the same group showed that federal unemployment insurance keeps workers in the job hunt and families out of poverty.,HER,photo

A single-payer system  like Medicare  is the cure for America's ailing healthcare - Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)  The Guardian:   I start my approach to healthcare from two very basic premises. First  healthcare must be recognized as a right  not a privilege. Every man  woman and child in our country should be able to access the healthcare they need regardless of their income. Second  we must create a national healthcare system that provides quality healthcare for all in the most cost-effective way possible.  Tragically  the United States is failing in both areas.  It is unconscionable that in one of the most advanced nations in the world  there are nearly 50 million people who lack health insurance and millions more who have burdensome co-payments and deductibles. In fact  some 45 000 Americans die each year because they do not get to a doctor when they should. In terms of life expectancy  infant mortality and other health outcomes  the United States lags behind almost every other advanced country.  Despite this unimpressive record  the US spends almost twice as much per person on healthcare as any other nation. As a result of an incredibly wasteful  bureaucratic  profit-making and complicated system  the US spends 17% of its gross domestic product – approximately $2.7tn annually– on healthcare. While insurance companies  drug companies  private hospitals and medical equipment suppliers make huge profits  Americans spend more and get less for their healthcare dollars.  What should the US be doing to improve this abysmal situation?  Continue reading here: http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/30/single-payer-cure-healthcare-reform,HER,link

Global Warming is a Greater Threat than Al Qaeda:  “You have the entire scientific community saying we have to be very aggressive in cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Yet you’re seeing the heads of coal companies and oil companies willing to sacrifice the wellbeing of the entire planet for their short-term profits. And these folks are funding phony organizations to try to create doubt about the reality of global warming ” Sen. Bernie Sanders said in an interview published in the November issue of Playboy magazine. “Big business is willing to destroy the planet for short-term profits. I regard that as just incomprehensible. Incomprehensible. And because of their power over the political process  you hear a deafening silence in the U.S. Congress and in other bodies around the world about the severity of the problem. Global warming is a far more serious problem than al Qaeda.”  What do you think?

From the end of World War II until 1973  we saw an expanding middle class  with people’s incomes going up. Since that point  and especially since the Wall Street–driven financial crisis  you’ve seen a real collapse. Since 1999 median family income has gone down $5 000. Real unemployment  counting people who have given up looking for work or who are working part-time when they want to work full-time  is more than 14 percent.

Remember Rep. Paul Ryan? The failed Republican candidate for vice president has been relatively quiet as Tea Party extremists have commandeered his party and the debate over the government shutdown. But the House Budget Committee chairman waded into the debt-limit debate in a column published Wednesday in The Wall Street Journal. He said he would consider letting the government avoid default if “entitlement reform” is a part of the deal.  Translation: he wants to cut Social Security benefits and change Medicare.

Today’s news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Koch Brothers Finance Tea Party Agenda: The Koch brothers and other billionaires are financing expensive campaigns to promote the Tea Party agenda starting with defunding President Barack Obama's health care law  Sen. Bernie Sanders told MSNBC's Thomas Roberts on Monday. "Obamacare is just the tip of the iceberg " Sanders added. He said the extreme right wing also wants massive cuts to Social Security  Medicare and Medicaid.   A Planned Shutdown: Sen. Sanders criticized House Republicans Monday for causing a government shutdown that was “planned by the Koch brothers and other very wealthy people from the day after Obama was re-elected ” WPTZ-TV reported. “Can you imagine  Mr. President  billionaires  billionaires going to war against working people so that they and their kids cannot get health insurance? I mean I thing that is just obscene ” Sanders said in a Senate floor speech on WFFF-TV and WVNY-TV.   How the Shutdown Could End: Sen. Sanders said the government will reopen when the Republicans understand that they may lose the House of Representatives because the overwhelming majority of Americans  while disagreeing on Obamacare  nevertheless believe that it should not have been used to precipitate a government shutdown or to create a crisis over whether the United States defaults on its debts. “At the end of the day when they see that it will be politically dangerous for them to continue along this path they will change their tune ” Sanders told America Tonight anchor Joey Chen on Al Jazeera America.   Americans are Angry: “They are hurting. The average person in this country lives paycheck to paycheck and they look here at Capitol Hill and they see that instead of creating jobs we’re sending people home without pay ” Sanders said. “The way you deal with it is to say  ‘Excuse me. We’re going to remove you from office. You’re going to be defeated politically  and we’re going to have some sensible people in to replace you.’ That would be my hope and that’s my expectation ” Sanders added in the Al Jazeera America interview.

I got into politics not to figure out how to become President. I got into politics because I give a damn.  I do think that it is an outrage that we have people sleeping out on the streets in this country. I do think it is an outrage that 51% of young African-Americans are unemployed or underemployed. I do think it is an outrage that millions of people don't have any health insurance. That's what I feel in my gut. And that's why I'm fighting for change.,HER,status
I'll tell you what does worry me. Ever since Trump has been opening his mouth  you're seeing all these bitter people  latent racists who are becoming emboldened. A few months ago we were supposed to hate Mexicans. Now we're supposed to hate Muslims. And that kind of crap is not going to work in the United States of America.   What we have got to do immediately is to say that racism and xenophobia are totally unacceptable and we will stand with Muslims and undocumented people in this country. We can't allow racism and xenophobia to gain traction.,HER,status

A lot of people have given up on the political process  and I want to get them involved in it. In this fight we are going to take on the greed of the billionaire class. And they are very  very powerful  and they’re going to fight back furiously. The only way to succeed is when millions of people stand up and decide to engage. And what this campaign is showing is that thousands and thousands of Americans have already begun doing just that.,HER,photo
You are looking at one candidate for president who does not have a super PAC and I’m damn proud of that. I’m not gonna take money from billionaires. I don’t want their money. This is a people's campaign.,HER,photo
The evening was really pretty sad. This country and our planet face enormous problems. And the Republican candidates barely touched upon them tonight.

Let me tell you something about our country that the billionaire class doesn’t want you to know...,HER,video
This campaign will be driven by issues and serious debate; not political gossip  not reckless personal attacks or character assassination.,HER,photo
There is something profoundly wrong when we have a proliferation of millionaires and billionaires at the same time as we have the highest childhood poverty rate of any developed country on earth. This campaign is sending a message to the billionaire class: “you can’t have it all.” You can’t get huge tax breaks while children in this country go hungry. http://bernie.to/OntheIssues-ChildPoverty,HER,photo
Let me tell my Republican colleagues that I respectfully disagree with their approach. Instead of cutting Social Security  we need to expand Social Security benefits. Instead of cutting head start and childcare  we need to move to a universal pre-k system for all the children of this country. As Franklin Delano Roosevelt reminded us: “The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much  it is whether we provide enough for those who have little.” And that is a test that we as a nation must once again meet and master.,HER,status
The reason why we are doing well in this campaign is because we are telling the truth. We are talking to the reality of American life today. We are talking about a reality in which almost all of the wealth and income in this country is going to the top 1 percent and we are going to change that.,HER,photo
This is a campaign that is on the move and  together  this is a campaign that will end in victory.,HER,link
Portland set the record tonight. Including the 9 000 who couldn’t get in the doors  an astonishing 28 000 people showed up for our rally. We began this campaign all of three and a half months ago and the momentum has been nothing less than extraordinary. This campaign is sending a message to the billionaire class: Yes we do have the guts to take you on! They may have unlimited sums of money  but we have a united people.,HER,link
Seattle  15 000 of you came out tonight and stood up to say loudly and clearly  “this country belongs to all of us  not just the billionaire class." I hope you can imagine a country where government works for all of us and not just a few.,HER,photo
The Republican debate is over. Not one word about income and wealth inequality  climate change  Citizens United or student debt. That's why the Republicans are so out of touch with the American people. What I heard was more tax breaks for the rich  more people losing health insurance and more talk about war. This is not what we need.,HER,status
I hope very much that you will become part of our campaign team. And I hope that you will watch our video and never forget: This country belongs to all of us  not just a handful of billionaires.,HER,video
It is an obscenity that we stigmatize so many young Americans with a criminal record for smoking marijuana  but not one major Wall Street executive has been prosecuted for causing the near-collapse of our entire economy.,HER,status

Check-out John Nichols’ article for The Nation where he discusses America’s jobs crisis and how it is disproportionately affecting young people and minorities.   In the article  he cites Senator Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) inclusion of a youth jobs program in the recently passed immigration reform bill as a positive step.  Nichols quotes Sanders as saying  “at a time when real unemployment is close to 14 percent and even higher among young people and minorities  it is absolutely imperative that we create millions of decent-paying jobs in our country. The establishment of a youth employment program for 400 000 young people is a good step forward but in the months to come we must do even more.”,LER,link

These attacks that we're going to see from the Republicans in massive cuts in food stamps is directly related to the attacks you're going to see on Social Security  Medicare  Medicaid & education. What the Republicans are about are huge tax breaks for the wealthiest people in this country  huge tax loopholes for corporations that make billions in profits - and then they go after working families  the elderly  the children  the sick & the poor.

I don’t look at Congress as having personality defects  people can’t get along & all that stuff  that’s not the issue.

The Federal government will be there  we'll compensate the loss of the payroll tax.' But when you have a 15 trillion dollar national debt  I do worry.

The American people - whether they are Republicans  Democrats  independents  conservatives  progressives - say that when the wealthiest people are doing phenomenally well  when their effective tax rate has gone down  you've got to ask the wealthy to pay more taxes.   The American people are saying when you have these huge corporate loop holes so that companies that made billions of dollars in a given year pay nothing in federal income tax  you've got to close those loop holes. And the American people  whether you're Tea Party or progressive  are also saying do not cut Social Security  Medicare  and Medicaid.  So we have a plan out there.

They lost their jobs. They lost their life savings. And  they lost their hope for the future. This is not what American democracy is supposed to look like. It is time for change at the Fed - real change.",LER,link

"In the midst of the worst economic crisis in modern American history  16% of our people - 25 million Americans - are unemployed or underemployed. Numbers are higher for the young kids graduating high school & college. Older workers  55  60  they're losing their jobs now - You know what? If we don't turn this economy around  those people are never going to have another job for the rest of their lives  impacting their retirement. In the midst of all that - the collapse of the Middle Class - you've got the Republicans living on another planet  not even recognizing the severity of the crisis  let alone doing anything about it.",LER,video

They have undue influence. The vast majority of the American people feel that we should be tough on Wall Street.

"The American people are hurting. A record-breaking 46 million Americans are living in poverty. Twenty-five million Americans need a full-time job. Nearly one out of four children in this country are living in poverty  and we now have the highest childhood poverty rate of any major advanced country on earth. Senior citizens on fixed incomes haven’t received a cost-of-living adjustment in their Social Security benefits for two years in a row  even as healthcare and drug prices have soared. And as Vermonters and other Americans living in northern states are preparing for the winter  the cost of home heating oil is soaring.  We cannot balance the federal budget on the backs of the most vulnerable Americans by slashing the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program.",LER,link
As you know  huge decisions are being made by this so-called "Super Committee" in Washington -- decisions that will affect our country for decades to come.  Last week  I asked you to join me as a citizen cosponsor of the Keeping Our Social Security Promises Act and the response has been tremendous. So far  over 60 000 Americans have supported scrapping the payroll tax cap on all income over $250 000 and making millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share into Social Security.  Now  I'd like you to join me in an interactive discussion on Social Security  jobs and the deficit committee. Deficit reduction is important  but it is not the most important issue we face. We are in the midst of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression and if the middle-class is to be saved we need to create millions of good paying jobs in the very near future and ensure the long-term solvency of Social Security.,LER,link

Sometimes  we all need a break from the seemingly endless partisan bickering of Washington. One of Senator Sanders' key aides  UVM English professor Huck Gutman  finds his escape in the power of poetry. What do you think?

“When the wealthiest people in this country are becoming wealthier & their tax rates are the lowest in 50 years; when major corporations are making billions in profits & in some cases paying nothing in taxes; do you REALLY think the solution is going to an 85-year-old person & taking $1000 out of his social security check?

Joe Biden is a good man and a great Vice President. Serving alongside him in the Senate and then the administration  I saw first-hand his passion for our country and our people. Like millions of others  I admire his devotion to family  his grace in grief  his grit and determination on behalf of the middle class  and his unyielding faith in America’s promise. As Vice President  Joe has been by President Obama’s side for every pivotal decision. He helped save the auto industry and pull our economy back from the brink of depression. He continues to fight for higher wages  safer communities  and a more peaceful world. It’s a record to be proud of  defend  and build on. And I am confident that history isn’t finished with Joe Biden. As he said today  there is more work to do. And if I know Joe  he will always be on the front-lines  always fighting for all of us. -H,HER,status

“It is just heartbreaking  it is sickening to me to see another massacre. People should not have to be afraid to go to college  like this one  or go to the movie theater  or go to bible study. What is wrong with us that we can't stand up to the NRA and the gun lobby and the gun manufacturers they represent?   You know  this is not just tragic. We don't just need to pray for people. We need to act. And we need to build a movement. It's infuriating. Every time there's another massacre Republicans and the NRA say  now is not the time to talk about guns. Yes  it is. But more than talk  it is time to act.  But Republicans keep refusing to do anything to protect our communities. They put the NRA ahead of American families. It is wrong and we need to make every politician who sides with them to look into the eyes of parents whose children have been murdered and explain why they listen to the gun lobbyist instead.  Now  I am well aware that this is a political mountain to climb. But you don't get anything done in this country if you don't start by calling it out. And we have had too many murders  too many people who should have never gotten guns in the first place taking out whatever their rage  their fury  their mental problems are by killing other people. And I will  as your president  never relent on trying to work on this.” -Hillary today in Florida,HER,status

The House voting to defund Planned Parenthood is an attack on women's health—nothing more  nothing less. Republicans should be ashamed.,HER,photo
Last night  11 Republican candidates continued their race to the bottom on women’s health and women's rights. They made one outlandish statement after another. And every single candidate on stage has pledged to defund Planned Parenthood if they become president.   It's bad enough to see hateful rhetoric and lies in a presidential debate. But just like the candidates on stage last night  Republicans in Congress want to defund Planned Parenthood. And they’re willing to shut down the federal government to do it  no matter how bad that is for our country. That’s how far they’ll go to stop an organization that provides 500 000 breast exams  400 000 pap tests  and 4.5 million STD tests every year.    Repeating false statements doesn't make them true  no matter how many times you do it. Defunding a trusted health care provider that serves one in five women in America doesn't help anyone – in fact  it would hurt hundreds of thousands of people. Speaker Boehner and his colleagues have a job to do  and they should do it. Here’s my message to them: Don’t attack women’s health care. And don’t shut down the government. -H,HER,status

I wanted you to hear this directly from me:  Yes  I should have used two email addresses  one for personal matters and one for my work at the State Department. Not doing so was a mistake. I'm sorry about it  and I take full responsibility.  It's important for you to know a few key facts. My use of a personal email account was aboveboard and allowed under the State Department's rules. Everyone I communicated with in government was aware of it. And nothing I ever sent or received was marked classified at the time.   As this process proceeds  I want to be as transparent as possible. That's why I've provided all of my work emails to the government to be released to the public  and why I'll be testifying in public in front of the Benghazi Committee later next month.  I know this is a complex story. I could have—and should have—done a better job answering questions earlier. I'm grateful for your support  and I'm not taking anything for granted.

Apoyo completamente una reforma migratoria. Es lo que siempre he apoyado y continuaré apoyando y como Presidenta haré todo lo posible para hacerla una realidad.

No vamos a cambiar nuestra constitución para eliminar la ciudadanía por nacimiento  eso sería dar un paso atrás.

What we’ve seen too much of in the last few years is a spate of people who have reached for a gun before they really figured out what was going on. They’ve been much too eager to use that gun—we’ve seen it with policing and we’ve seen it with civilians.   With police  first and foremost  they need to be trained and held accountable and disciplined in a way that prevents the reaction that we’ve seen way too much of. And with civilians—a lot of these “stand your ground” laws need to be rewritten. If you have to defend yourself  OK. But look at some of the instances we’ve had—Trayvon Martin  and too many more.   Nobody should want to create circumstances in which innocent  unarmed people are killed—either by law enforcement or by civilians wielding guns. We’ve got to figure out how to deal with that.,HER,status

“I stand strongly in favor of comprehensive immigration reform.

And certainly from my perspective  what is being said by those running on the Republican side is incredibly offensive  it is unrealistic  it is mean-spirited—I’ve run out of adjectives. The idea that the United States of America would round up 11 or 12 million people and deport them is absolute fantasy  and we need to end that kind of talk because it is very hurtful to hardworking people who are here and their families  generations of them. The idea that we would amend our Constitution to do away with citizenship by birth is absolutely the wrong direction to go. So I will be speaking out on this over and over again because I want to make sure everyone—not just every Hispanic person  but every American—understands what the import of this rhetoric on the other side actually is  because it is inflammatory and something that every sensible American should reject.”—Hillary,HER,status

What Donald Trump said about Megyn Kelly after the first Republican debate was offensive  and it deserves the kind of reaction that it's getting from so many others—but if we focus on that  we're making a mistake. What a lot of the men on that stage in the debate said was offensive: some very radical and offensive positions when it comes to women's lives  women's reproductive health  women's opportunities.    When one of the GOP’s major candidates  Marco Rubio  says there should be no exceptions for rape and incest in a ban on abortion  that is as offensive and as troubling a comment as you can hear from a major candidate running for the presidency. The language may be more colorful and more offensive when it comes from one candidate  but the thinking  and the attitude  toward women is very much the same as the rest—it's just delivered in a different package. What they say about women should not be forgotten.   So yes  it makes great TV. Trump went way overboard: offensive  outrageous  pick your adjective. But what Rubio said has as much of an impact in terms of where the Republican party is today as anybody else on that stage. And it is deeply troubling  and it should be to the press  not just to those who fight for women’s health and rights.,HER,status

The gun control push illustrates the misguided priorities of President Obama and Hillary Clinton. They refuse to stand up and do what is necessary to defeat radical Islamic terrorism  to defeat ISIS  to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Instead  they remain obsessed with disarming the American citizenry  of stripping us of our fundamental right to protect our homes  our lives  and our families.  You don’t get rid of the bad guys by getting rid of our guns. You get rid of the bad guys by using our guns.,HER,link
Thankful for time with the family this Thanksgiving!,HER,photo
On this Thanksgiving  as we gather with family and loved ones  we celebrate the blessings the Lord has bestowed upon us and this great nation. Particularly this year  as we face many uncertainties – from the threats of terror to economic hardships – let us take time to thank God for all that he has given us and ask for his provision in our lives and our country.  When we think back to that first Thanksgiving in 1621  and all that the Pilgrims endured  only half surviving the first brutal winter  we remember sacrifice upon which this land was built – and the sacrifice that continues to keep us free and safe. In the struggle for independence  the brave motley group of soldiers defeated the greatest military force in the world. In the battle against slavery  the blood shed to purge this people from our original sin. In the World Wars  the thousands who fought in the trenches and scaled the cliffs of Normandy to save the American idea.  We are grateful for all those who have gone before us and for those who continue to serve: for the soldiers  sailors  airmen  and Marines who courageously defend our freedom. For the police officers  firefighters  and first responders who protect our communities. And for the pastors  teachers  and parents who guide us to know the truth  and be set free by it.  And we remember President George Washington’s call in the first Thanksgiving Day Proclamation  226 years ago  to "unite in most humbly offering our prayers and supplications to the great Lord and Ruler of Nations  and beseech Him to pardon our national and other transgressions… to render our National Government a blessing to all the people… and to promote the knowledge and practice of true religion and virtue."  It is this hope in a Higher Ruler that inspired the Pilgrims to leave everything in pursuit of freedom  and it is this same Providence that  if we call upon the name of the Lord  will restore the promise of America.,HER,link
Mr. President  let’s have a debate on Syrian refugees. Right now. Anywhere you want.,HER,link
We cannot defeat radical Islamic terrorism with a President who refuses to utter the words “radical Islamic terrorism.”,HER,video
America must stand with our allies against the scourge of radical Islamic terrorism. This is an evil that does not discriminate between French  German or American  Christian  Muslim or Jew  soldier  football player  or concert goer. Their only goal is to murder those who do not submit to their vicious  totalitarian ideology. Our deepest condolences go out to our French allies  and I know the government of the United States stands by to offer any assistance necessary.  We must now face the facts. Between the downing of the Russian jet over Egypt and this massive coordinated attack on Paris  we are seeing an unmistakable escalation of ISIS’ ambitions and the scale of their terrorist attacks outside Syria and Iraq. Even as chaos rages in Paris  we need to take immediate  commonsense steps to preserve our own safety. We need to consult closely with our NATO allies who may be targeted for additional attacks. We need to immediately declare a halt to any plans to bring refugees that may have been infiltrated by ISIS to the United States. We need to redouble our efforts to prevent ISIS agents from penetrating our nation by other means.  Such steps  however  are defensive reactions to an enemy that will continue to try to attack us until they succeed once again. We must immediately recognize that our enemy is not ‘violent extremism.’ It is the radical Islamism that has declared jihad against the west. It will not be appeased by outreach or declarations of tolerance. It will not be deterred by targeted airstrikes with zero tolerance for civilian casualties  when the terrorists have such utter disregard for innocent life. We must make it crystal clear that affiliation with ISIS and related terrorist groups brings with it the undying enmity of America—that it is  in effect  signing your own death warrant.,HER,link

Praise God Kim has been released! https://www.facebook.com/tedcruzpage/posts/10153570897667464,HER,photo
Today  judicial lawlessness crossed into judicial tyranny. Today  for the first time ever  the government arrested a Christian woman for living according to her faith. This is wrong. This is not America.  I stand with Kim Davis. Unequivocally. I stand with every American that the Obama Administration is trying to force to choose between honoring his or her faith or complying with a lawless court decision.  In dissent  Chief Justice Roberts rightly observed that the Court’s marriage decision has nothing to do with the Constitution. Justice Scalia observed that the Court’s decision was so contrary to law that state and local officials would choose to defy it.  For every politician — Democrat and Republican — who is tut-tutting that Davis must resign  they are defending a hypocritical standard. Where is the call for the mayor of San Francisco to resign for creating a sanctuary city — resulting in the murder of American citizens by criminal illegal aliens welcomed by his lawlessness?  Where is the call for President Obama to resign for ignoring and defying our immigration laws  our welfare reform laws  and even his own Obamacare?  When the mayor of San Francisco and President Obama resign  then we can talk about Kim Davis.  Those who are persecuting Kim Davis believe that Christians should not serve in public office. That is the consequence of their position. Or  if Christians do serve in public office  they must disregard their religious faith–or be sent to jail.  Kim Davis should not be in jail. We are a country founded on Judeo-Christian values  founded by those fleeing religious oppression and seeking a land where we could worship God and live according to our faith  without being imprisoned for doing so.  I call upon every Believer  every Constitutionalist  every lover of liberty to stand with Kim Davis. Stop the persecution now.,HER,link

May we never forget the men and women who lost their lives in an unspeakable act of aggression 73 years ago. On December 7  1941  Japan attacked Pearl Harbor launching the United States into World War II.  The Greatest Generation heroically answered the call to defend freedom and defeat evil across the world. May we continue to honor their sacrifice by doing all we can to preserve the beacon of freedom in our own time.,HER,photo
Moments ago  President Obama announced he would unilaterally grant amnesty to millions of people who have come to our country illegally.  I have one question: Why is President Obama making it easier for immigrants to come to our nation illegally rather than legally?  His actions are not only unconstitutional and in defiance of the American people who said they did not want amnesty in the 2014 elections  but they are also unfair to every immigrant who has come to our nation legally.  We are all the sons and daughters of immigrants who dreamed of opportunity in a nation where if you worked hard and played by the rules  you could achieve anything.  We can’t let one President abandon that dream for us all: www.stopobamasamnesty.com,HER,status

Free Speech Matters  The reason that so many Americans love Duck Dynasty is because it represents the America usually ignored or mocked by liberal elites:  a family that loves and cares for each other  believes in God  and speaks openly about their faith.     If you believe in free speech or religious liberty  you should be deeply dismayed over the treatment of Phil Robertson. Phil expressed his personal views and his own religious faith; for that  he was suspended from his job. In a free society  anyone is free to disagree with him--but the mainstream media should not behave as the thought police censoring the views with which they disagree.  And  as PC enforcers often forget  tolerance is a two-way street. Here's what Phil himself had to say about accepting and loving everybody:  “I myself am a product of the 60s; I centered my life around sex  drugs and rock and roll until I hit rock bottom and accepted Jesus as my Savior.  My mission today is to go forth and tell people about why I follow Christ and also what the bible teaches  and part of that teaching is that women and men are meant to be together.  However  I would never treat anyone with disrespect just because they are different from me. We are all created by the Almighty and like Him  I love all of humanity. We would all be better off if we loved God and loved each other.”,HER,status

The attacks on Paris are a wake up call. This is not a grievance-based conflict. This is a clash of civilizations. Either they win or we win.,HER,video
My prayers tonight are with the people of France as they come to terms with the terrible tragedy unfolding in Paris. These brutal terrorist attacks against innocent civilians are a reminder of the increasing dangers facing free peoples around the world  and it is important for all Americans to stand with the people of France in this difficult time. As we learn more about the attacks and who is behind them  the United States should assist the French government in finding those who are accountable and bringing them to justice. We cannot let those who seek to disrupt our way of life succeed. We must increase our efforts at home and abroad to improve our defenses  destroy terrorist networks  and deprive them of the space from which to operate.,HER,status

Resettling refugees is a proud and important part of Canada’s humanitarian tradition. It reflects our commitment to Canadians and it demonstrates to the world that we have a shared responsibility to help people who are displaced and fleeing persecution. Protecting the safety  security  and health of Canadians and refugees is a key factor in guiding the Government of Canada’s plan to resettle 25 000 Syrian refugees as quickly as possible – while also taking the time to do it right.

Today  I had the pleasure of introducing our team of extraordinary Canadians who will serve as Ministers in your new government. As a Canadian  you expect to see your values and priorities reflected in your government – and we have listened closely. Our strong  diverse  and experienced team will serve all Canadians  and – for the first time in our country’s history – there will be an equal number of women and men around the Cabinet table.  Over the course of the campaign  we promised you a government that will bring real change – in both the things we do and the way we do them. We will immediately start implementing our plan for a strong and growing middle class. On Election Day  you sent a clear message  and you rightly expect us to fulfill our promises.  I am writing to you  today  to reaffirm my commitment to spend the next four years working hard to deliver on those promises. It is time for leadership that never seeks to divide Canadians  but takes every single opportunity to bring us together  including in Parliament.  We made a commitment to invest in growing our economy  strengthening our middle class  and helping those working hard to join it. We committed to fighting climate change and protecting our environment. We made a commitment to provide more direct help to those who need it by giving less to those who do not. We committed to public investment as the best way to spur growth  job creation  and economic prosperity. And we committed to a responsible  transparent fiscal plan for challenging economic times. We expect you to hold the government accountable for delivering these commitments.  Our country faces many real and immediate challenges – from a struggling middle class to the threat of climate change. If we are to overcome these obstacles  Canadians need to have faith in their government’s honesty and willingness to listen. That is why we committed to set a higher bar for openness and transparency in Ottawa. Government and its information must be open by default. Simply put  it is time to shine more light on government to make sure it remains focused on the people it was created to serve – you.  But in order for you to trust your government  you need a government that will trust you. When we make a mistake – as all governments do – it is important that we acknowledge that mistake and learn from it. We know that you do not expect us to be perfect – but you expect us to work tirelessly  and to be honest  open  and sincere in our efforts to serve the public interest.  Before the election  we also made a commitment to bring new leadership and a new tone to Ottawa. Moving forward  we will pursue our goals and objectives with a renewed sense of collaboration. We fully understand and appreciate that partnerships with provincial  territorial  and municipal governments are vital to deliver the real  positive change that we promised you.  It is also time for a renewed  Nation-to-Nation relationship with Indigenous Peoples  one based on a recognition of rights  respect  co-operation  and partnership. Not only is this the right thing to do  but it is also a sure path to economic growth.  To close  I am deeply grateful to have this opportunity to serve you – and every Canadian across our great country. I am committed to leading an open  honest government that is accountable to Canadians  lives up to the highest ethical standards  brings our country together  and applies the utmost care and prudence in the handling of public funds.  Thank you for having faith in me. Thank you for putting your trust in our team.  We will not let you down.  Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  P.C  M.P. Prime Minister of Canada,HER,status

Nathan Cirillo who tragically lost their lives. We continue to grieve with their families.   Our servicemen and women  who have put their lives on the line for their country  stand for the very best of what it means to be Canadian. We will live up to our sacred obligation to Canada’s men and women in uniform  our veterans  and their families.   As I said in addressing the country last year  the picture in our minds – of Canadians helping and protecting Canadians – that is who we truly are  and it is who we shall continue to be.   We will not allow threats to shape us  nor bow to those who mean to undermine our values and way of life. Canadians are kind and generous  open-minded  and optimistic. We know that Canada was built by people from all corners of the world  who worship every faith  who belong to every culture  and who speak every language.   Today  on this solemn anniversary  I join Canadians from coast to coast to coast in committing that we shall continue moving forward  together.,HER,status

Real change has come to Canada  and it's because of you.  Your knocks and calls. Your donations. Your support on social media. And most importantly  your votes.  From every last candidate  to every last volunteer  donor and supporter  remember: I didn’t make history. You did.  For three years  we had a very old-fashioned strategy. We met and talked with as many Canadians as we could. And we listened.  We beat fear with hope. We beat cynicism with hard work.  We beat negative  divisive politics with a positive vision that brings Canadians together.  Most of all  we defeated the idea that Canadians should be satisfied with less. That good enough is good enough  and that better just isn’t possible.  Well my friends. This is Canada. And in Canada... Better is always possible.  You built this platform. You built this movement. You told us what you need to be successful. You told us what kind of government you want  and we built the plan to make it happen.  Now  we start on our next challenge: achieving real change for the middle class. And Canadians are counting on us to deliver.  Thank you again for all your hope and hard work.,HER,status

So let’s get this straight: CEO Hank Greenberg ran AIG as it recklessly gambled on mortgage-backed securities – and left just before his company took a $182 billion bailout from the Bush Administration. Once his Republican friends were out of office  Greenberg sued the Obama Administration because – get this – the bailout wasn’t generous enough for him. And now  Hank Greenberg is giving $10 million of his AIG fortune to try to save Jeb Bush’s dying Presidential campaign.    I’m not sure what’s more disgusting: That Jeb Bush is pinning his Presidential hopes on his brother’s bailout money  or that bailed-out CEOs are trying to buy elections. This is business as usual for Wall Street and Washington insiders  and it stinks.,HER,link

My grandson Atticus is almost five  and he loves gadgets. Atticus makes coffee with Bruce every morning we visit because he’s fascinated by the way the coffee maker works. I have no doubt that someday we’ll show up and Atticus will have built his own coffee maker or toaster or clock or some sort of flying robot with really cool dragon wings. And who knows? Maybe someday Atticus – or one of his big sisters – will build something that changes the world. We invest in science and education so that kids like Atticus – or Ahmed in Texas – can create a world we never dreamed of. Let’s invest in our kids’ dreams – not tear them down with hatred and fear.  #IStandwithAhmed,HER,photo
Sometimes I look around the Senate and think: Did you guys fall down  hit your heads  and think you woke up in the 1950s? I simply cannot believe that in 2015  the Senate would consider shutting down the government to defund Planned Parenthood and women’s health care. So Ted Cruz wants a big fight over defunding Planned Parenthood? I say: Bring it on  Ted. I’ve lived in a world with backward-looking ideologues interfering in women's health. We’re not going back.

80 years ago today  FDR signed the Social Security Act into law – and it was in large part thanks to a remarkable woman from Massachusetts: Frances Perkins. Coming out of the Great Depression  Frances Perkins was FDR’s Secretary of Labor – the first woman in US history to hold a cabinet position  and a chief architect of the New Deal. God bless Frances Perkins.   FDR and Frances Perkins knew Social Security was about economics  but it was also about our values. It’s about who we are as a people  and what kind of country we are determined to build. Today  I’m fighting hard to make sure we don’t cut a dime of Social Security benefits. I’m fighting to protect and expand Social Security – and I hope you’ll fight alongside me.   Happy birthday  Social Security – and a special thanks to Frances Perkins—a tough woman with a vision!,HER,photo
The first time Jon Stewart invited me onto The Daily Show six years ago  I threw up backstage. I had gut-wrenching  stomach-turning stage fright. I was a no-name college professor there in 2009 to talk about oversight of the Wall Street bailout. It was important – and I didn’t want to mess up and become the joke. The first couple of minutes seemed so terrible  I thought I would have to resign from my new position on the TARP Congressional Oversight Panel. But when we got to the commercial break  Jon could tell that I hadn’t said what I’d come to say. He took my arm  told me to stay in my seat -- and then he let me deliver this message. That moment changed my life.   I’m grateful for every single time someone has come up to me and asked: “Hey  aren’t you that lady I saw on Jon Stewart?” Because almost every time I’ve told someone  “Yup  that’s me ” they’ve followed it up with: “Keep fighting!” That’s what Jon has done for 16 years: with passion and humor  he skewered the people who needed skewering  called out the big guys who rig the system  and prodded us all to fight back.  Thanks  Jon!,HER,video

By the time I was 30  I thought my life was settled. Granted  not quite what I’d expected—but settled. I was a single mom with two little kids  and I’d just started teaching law in Houston. And then I met a guy from Massachusetts named Bruce. I was completely crazy about him  and I still am. When I proposed to him  he said yes. I bought a sundress that could double as a wedding gown  and 35 years ago today  I married Bruce.  Bruce has about a million good qualities  but I want to mention one: Throughout my career  and all the unexpected twists and turns  he has never once discouraged me from taking on a fight. He’s always believed that if I wanted people to listen to my ideas  I might as well shout from the highest mountain I could find.

My daddy worked hard his whole life.   Like a lot of families  we had ups and downs. At different times  Daddy sold fencing  housewares and carpeting. He tried building a small business. He worked as a maintenance man. When I was 12  we lost the family station wagon  and came about an inch from losing our home.    There was no money for me to go to college. My mother wanted me to be safe  and she thought the best thing I could do was find a good husband. But I wanted to be a teacher – and Daddy convinced her to let me try. Later on  he never seemed to think that I’d ruin my children because I was a Working Mother  and he never showed any doubt that I could manage on my own. He read the books I wrote and cheered me on in my battles with big banks. In the end  I think Daddy found it deeply satisfying that his baby girl became a law professor and learned to fight for families like ours.   Happy Father’s Day to all the dads trying their hardest – and inspiring their little girls (and boys) to dream big.,HER,photo

TPP supporters say that when people like you read the trade deal  you'll support it. And that's a good idea – you should be able to read it  decide for yourself  and then tell your representatives what you think about it.

Help us set the record straight about this secret deal  and join our fight to make the TPP agreement public before Congress votes on TPA/Fast Track.,HER,photo
I have a scar on my finger that’s a little less than an inch long. I got it on Mother’s Day. I was in fifth grade  and I was determined to make breakfast for my mother. I’d planned out the menu based on something I’d read somewhere  and it included fresh squeezed orange juice  which I’d never actually seen. It also turned out that I wasn’t very good at handling a knife. The orange slipped from my grasp  and I gave my finger a good whack. I remember lots of blood  lots of tears  lots of chaos. My brother David helped out  and we salvaged the breakfast. Mother praised it all  from the hand-made card to the cold toast  and I was sure that this was the best Mother’s Day ever in the history of Mother’s Days. My mother is gone now  but on Mother's Day  I smile when I think of the day I sliced my finger instead of the orange. The day I wanted to do something big to celebrate all that she did for me. For me  Mother’s Day is a celebration of giving – what our mothers gave us and what we try to give back. Happy Mother’s Day!,HER,photo

Six years ago next week  Jon Stewart first let me come on his show to talk about how the biggest banks on Wall Street had just broken our economy. And bless him  even though I had such gut-wrenching stage fright that I threw up back stage  Jon has invited me back year after year – as a law professor  a government advisor  a candidate and a senator – to talk about how we’re fighting to level the playing field.

Coming out of the Great Depression  our country was at a crossroads. We made the decision together to invest in ourselves  in our kids  and in our future – and for nearly 50 years  it worked. And then in the 1980s  our country moved in another direction  and we found ourselves living in a very different world – one where the rich just got richer  and everyone else was left behind. No one spoke more powerfully about what was happening to America’s struggling middle class than Governor Mario Cuomo.

Since 2009  the big banks and financial institutions have paid at least $128 billion to regulators for the tricks and traps that brought down our economy. But they are happy to pay the fines – in fact  JP Morgan gave its CEO Jamie Dimon a 74% raise for negotiating its settlement. If these settlements are so weak that Wall Street is celebrating  it's not a good deal for the American people. That's why I introduced the Truth in Settlements Act to require accessible  detailed disclosures about settlement agreements. Just a couple weeks ago  the bill made it through the Senate Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs Committee and can now receive a full Senate vote.

Even Wall Street admits: Student loan debt is crushing home ownership. College graduates who owe more than $50 000 in student loan debt are 8% less likely to own a home than their classmates.

My Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act is just one small way to start giving student loan borrowers some relief.   ,HER,link

Today is President Barack Obama's birthday  which seems like a good time to remind the anarchy gang in Congress about the reality of the world they’re living in.   Back in 2012  the Republicans tried to win the presidency. They picked their candidate  spent a zillion dollars  made their best case to the American people  and lost to President Obama by five million votes.   Five million votes. And they didn’t vote for the President by such a wide margin so that the Republicans could hold the government hostage until 2016  or 2020  or 2024  or whenever they think they can win the presidency again. And they didn’t vote for President Obama so that Congress could waste time and taxpayer money on foolish stunts like lawsuits and impeachments.   Here’s the deal: Congress is supposed to do its job every day. We shouldn’t stop working to make the lives of millions of Americans better just because we don’t like the political party in charge – and we shouldn’t make Block-the-President a political game that takes priority over helping get this country working better for working people.   It’s time for the Republicans in Congress to remember that it’s their job to work with President Obama – on his birthday and every day. Happy Birthday  Mr. President!,HER,status

Like a lot of little girls  I loved my daddy dearly. I loved to do things alongside him. When I was nine  he taught me to paint  letting me manage the main part of repainting our front door. When I was ten  he let me help him tar the roof on the carport he built. I was so proud that he thought I was big enough and dependable enough to help.    Through the years we put up a new ceiling in the living room  hung wallpaper  and dug up flower beds together. Daddy was a quiet man  but when we worked  he would talk about the widest range of things. After I was married and had my own house  we kept up our projects. Several years ago  I rescued an old floor lamp from a dumpster. We cleaned it up  and I can still hear him telling me to hold the pieces steady as he fished through the new wiring. That was also when he told me that the cancer had come back.   My daddy worked hard his whole life.  He sold fencing and carpeting  and ended up as a maintenance man. He and my mother never had much  but he said that his life was a success because his four kids had more opportunities than he had.

Scott Brown is refusing to disclose how much he is being paid to speak at a hedge fund conference in Las Vegas this week. Wow.

The decision of how tough to be when a big bank breaks the law should not be delegated from governors to staff of the Federal Reserve.

While the full picture of what happened is still emerging  we know that there were multiple terror incidents across Paris and over 120 people are feared dead with many more injured.   We must be prepared for a number of British casualties  and we are doing all we can to help those caught up in the attack.   These were innocent victims enjoying a Friday night out with friends and family  no doubt at the end of a hard week.   They were not seeking to harm anyone.   They were simply going about their way of life – our way of life.   And they were killed and injured by brutal  callous murderers who want to destroy everything our two countries stand for.   Peace. Tolerance. Liberty.   But we will not let them.   We will redouble our efforts to wipe out this poisonous extremist ideology and  together with the French and our allies around the world  stand up for all we believe in.     I have just chaired a meeting of COBR to review the security situation here in the UK.   The threat level is already at severe  which means an attack is highly likely  and will remain so.   Our police and intelligence agencies work round the clock to do all they can to keep us safe.     Ever since the co-ordinated firearms attacks in Mumbai in 2008  we have all been working together to ensure we could respond to such an attack.   This Summer police and other emergency services carried out a major exercise to test our response for multiple firearms attacks.   And in light of last night’s attacks  we will review our plans and make sure we learn any appropriate lessons.   It is clear that the threat from ISIL is evolving.   Last night’s attack suggests a new degree of planning and co-ordination and a greater ambition for mass casualty attacks.   And we must recognise that however strong we are  however much we prepare  we in the UK face the same threat.   That’s why we continue to encourage the public to remain vigilant.     And we will do all we can to support our police and our intelligence agencies with the resources and capabilities they need.   The terrorist aim is clear.   It is to divide us and to destroy our way of life.   So more than ever we must come together and stand united.   And carry on with the way of life we know and love.   I hope to speak to President Hollande later today and I will make clear that we will do whatever we can to help.   Your values are our values.   Your pain is our pain.   Your fight is our fight.   Together we will defeat these terrorists.,HER,status

Firstly  thank you so much for your support - not just during the election campaign  but over the past five years.  Together we have laid the foundations for a better future - and now  with a Conservative majority government  we must build on them.  We are on the brink of something special in our country.  We can make Britain a place where a good life is in reach for everyone who is willing to work and do the right thing.  Our manifesto is a manifesto for working people. 3 million apprenticeships. More help with childcare. Cutting taxes for 30 million people. Building more homes. Creating millions more jobs. And an in-out referendum on our future in Europe.  And as we conduct this vital work  we must ensure that we bring our country together. So we will govern as a party of one nation. One United Kingdom.  That means ensuring the recovery reaches all parts of our country; giving everyone a chance in life  no matter where they're from; and of course it means bringing together the different nations of our United Kingdom.  Five years ago  our country was in the grip of an economic crisis. Five years on  Britain is so much stronger.  But the real opportunities lie ahead. And I'm convinced that we can take these islands  with our proud history  and build an even prouder future.  So if you're not already a Member  please join the Conservatives today - and together  we can make Great Britain greater still.,HER,link

We have always been an open nation  welcoming those who want to make a contribution and build a decent life for themselves and their families.  But people have understandably become frustrated.  They want Government to have control over the numbers of people coming here and the circumstances in which they come. And yet in recent years  it has become clear that successive Governments have lacked that control.  So my objective is simple: to make our immigration system fairer  and reduce the current exceptionally high level of migration from within the EU into the UK.  First  we want to create the toughest system in the EU for dealing with abuse of free movement. This includes stronger powers to deport criminals and stop them coming back.  Second  EU migrants should have a job offer before they come here - and UK taxpayers will not support them if they don't. And if an EU jobseeker has not found work within six months  they will be required to leave.  Third  we want to reduce the number of EU workers coming to the UK - so in the future  they won't get benefits or social housing from Britain unless they have been here for at least four years.  This is an issue which matters to the British people  and to our future in the European Union.  If I am elected as Prime Minister in May  I will negotiate to reform the European Union  and Britain's relationship with it. This issue of free movement will be a key part of that negotiation.  If I succeed  I will campaign to keep this country in a reformed EU. If we cannot put our relationship with the EU on a better footing  then of course I rule nothing out.  I want to know what you think about this important issue. Please leave a comment below and have your say.,HER,status

The people of Scotland have spoken. It is a clear result.  They have kept our country of four nations together.  Like millions of other people  I’m delighted.  As I said during the campaign  it would have broken my heart to see our United Kingdom come to an end.  And I know that sentiment was shared by people  not just across our country  but also around the world - because of what we've achieved together in the past and what we can do together in the future.  So now it is time for our United Kingdom to come together  and to move forward.  A vital part of that will be a balanced settlement - fair to people in Scotland  and importantly to everyone in England  Wales and Northern Ireland as well.  Let us first remember why we had this debate - and why it was right to do so.  The Scottish National Party was elected in 2011 in Scotland and promised a referendum on independence.  We could have blocked that  we could have put it off - but just as with other issues  it was right to take - not duck - the big decision.  I am a passionate believer in our United Kingdom - I wanted more than anything for our United Kingdom to stay together.  But I am also a democrat. And it was right that we respected the SNP's majority in Holyrood and gave the Scottish people the right to have their say.  Let us also remember why it was right to ask the definitive question  Yes or No.  Because now the debate has been settled for a generation - or as Alex Salmond has said  perhaps for a lifetime.  So there can be no disputes  no re-runs - we have heard the settled will of the Scottish people.  Scotland voted for a stronger Scottish Parliament backed by the strength and security of the United Kingdom  and I want to congratulate the No campaign for that - for showing people that our nations really are better together.  I also want to pay tribute to Yes Scotland for a well-fought campaign  and to say to all those who did vote for independence: 'we hear you'.  We now have a chance - a great opportunity - to change the way the British people are governed  and change it for the better.  Political leaders on all sides of the debate now bear a heavy responsibility to come together and work constructively to advance the interests of people in Scotland  as well as those in England  Wales and Northern Ireland  for each and every citizen of our United Kingdom.  To those in Scotland sceptical of the constitutional promises made  let me say this: we have delivered on devolution under this Government  and we will do so again in the next Parliament.  The three pro-union parties have made commitments on further powers for the Scottish Parliament.  We will ensure that they are honoured.  And I can announce today that Lord Smith of Kelvin - who so successfully led Glasgow’s Commonwealth Games - has agreed to oversee the process to take forward the devolution commitments  with powers over tax  spending and welfare all agreed by November and draft legislation published by January.  Just as the people of Scotland will have more power over their affairs  so it follows that the people of England  Wales and Northern Ireland must have a bigger say over theirs.  The rights of these voters need to be respected  preserved and enhanced as well.  It is absolutely right that a new and fair settlement for Scotland should be accompanied by a new and fair settlement that applies to all parts of the United Kingdom.  In Wales  there are proposals to give the Welsh Government and Assembly more powers.  And I want Wales to be at the heart of the debate on how to make our United Kingdom work for all our nations.  In Northern Ireland  we must work to ensure that the devolved institutions function effectively.  I have long believed that a crucial part missing from this national discussion is England.  We have heard the voice of Scotland - and now the millions of voices of England must not go ignored.  The question of English votes for English laws - the so-called West Lothian question - requires a decisive answer.  So  just as Scotland will vote separately in the Scottish Parliament on their issues of tax  spending and welfare  so too England  as well as Wales and Northern Ireland  should be able to vote on these issues - and all this must take place in tandem with  and at the same pace as  the settlement for Scotland.  I hope that is going to take place on a cross-party basis. I have asked William Hague to draw up these plans.  We will set up a Cabinet Committee right away and proposals will also be ready to the same timetable.  I hope the Labour Party and other parties will contribute.  It is also important we have wider civic engagement about how to improve governance in our United Kingdom  including how to empower our great cities - and we will say more about this in the coming days.  This referendum has been hard fought. It has stirred strong passions. It has electrified politics in Scotland  and caught the imagination of people across the whole of our United Kingdom.  It will be remembered as a powerful demonstration of the strength and vitality of our ancient democracy.  Record numbers registered to vote and record numbers cast their vote.  We can all be proud of that.  It has reminded us how fortunate we are that we are able to settle these vital issues at the ballot box  peacefully and calmly.  Now we must look forward  and turn this into the moment when everyone - whichever way they voted - comes together to build that better  brighter future for our entire United Kingdom.,HER,status
On Thursday  Scotland votes - and the future of our country is at stake.  It is a once-and-for-all decision. There is no going back. If Scotland votes yes  the United Kingdom will split  and we will go our separate ways forever.  I desperately want our family of nations to stay together. It would be heart-breaking to wake up on Friday morning to the end of the country we love.  The country that launched the Enlightenment  abolished slavery  drove the industrial revolution and defeated fascism.  A country with the British values of fairness  freedom and justice. Values that say wherever you are  whoever you are  your life has dignity and worth.  The greatest example of democracy the world has ever known  of openness  of people of different nationalities and faiths coming together as one.  Millions of people in England  Wales  Northern Ireland and Scotland could not bear to see our country  the greatest country on earth  ending forever on Friday.  Please help keep our family of nations together - use our Facebook app to send a personal message to your friends in Scotland today.,HER,link
Today  the whole country will want to express its deep sympathy for David Haines’ family.  They have endured the last 18 months of David’s captivity with extraordinary courage.  And now David has been murdered in the most callous and brutal way imaginable by an organisation which is the embodiment of evil.  We will hunt down those responsible and bring them to justice  no matter how long it takes.  David Haines was an aid worker.  He went into harm’s way not to harm people  but to help his fellow human beings in the hour of their direst need – from the Balkans to the Middle East.  His family spoke of the joy he felt when he learned he had got this job in Syria.  His selflessness  his decency  his burning desire to help others has today cost him his life.  But the whole country  like his grieving family  can be incredibly proud of what he did and what he stood for in his humanitarian mission.  David Haines was a British hero.  The fact that an aid worker was taken  held and brutally murdered at the hands of ISIL sums up what this organisation stands for. They are killing and slaughtering thousands of people  Muslims  Christians  minorities across Iraq and Syria.  They boast of their brutality.  They claim to do this in the name of Islam.  That is nonsense.  Islam is a religion of peace.  They are not Muslims. They are monsters.  They make no secret of their desire to do as much harm not just in the Middle East  but to any countries or peoples who seek to stand in their way or dare to stand for values they disagree with.  It was an ISIL fanatic who gunned down four people in a museum in Brussels.  So  let me be clear.  The British people need to know that this is a fanatical organisation called ISIL  that has not only murdered a British hostage.  They have planned - and continue to plan - attacks across Europe and in our country.  We are a peaceful people.  We do not seek out confrontation.  But we need to understand.  We cannot ignore this threat to our security and that of our allies.  There is no option of keeping our heads down that would make us safe.  The problem will merely get worse  as it has done over recent months  not just for us  but for Europe and for the world.  We cannot just walk on by if we are to keep this country safe.  We have to confront this menace.  Step by step  we must drive back  dismantle and ultimately destroy ISIL and what it stands for.  We will do so in a calm  deliberate way - but with an iron determination.  We will not do so on our own – but by working closely with our allies  not just the United States and in Europe  but also in the region.  Because this organisation poses a massive threat to the entire Middle East.  So we will defeat ISIL through a comprehensive and sustained counter-terrorism strategy.  First  we will work with the Iraqi Government to ensure it represents all its people  and is able to tackle this threat effectively.  We will support the Kurdish regional government  who are holding the front line against ISIL.  We will help them protect their own people - and the minorities  including Christians  they have helped already - through our supplies of ammunition and through training.  Second  we will work at the UN to mobilise the broadest possible support to bear down on ISIL.  Third  the United States is taking direct military action. We support their efforts.  British Tornadoes and surveillance aircraft have been helping with intelligence gathering and logistics.  This is not about British combat troops on the ground.  It is about working with others to extinguish this terrorist threat.  As this strategy intensifies  we are ready to take whatever steps are necessary to deal with this threat and keep our country safe.  Fourth  we will continue to support the enormous humanitarian efforts  including using the RAF to do so  to help the literally millions of people who have fled ISIL and are now living in appalling conditions.  And fifth  and perhaps most important  we will maintain and continually reinforce our formidable counter-terrorist effort here at home to prevent attacks and to hunt down those who are planning them.  People across this country will have been sickened by the fact that it could have been a British citizen – a British citizen – who could have carried out this unspeakable act.  It is the very opposite of everything our country stands for.  It falls to the Government  and to each and every one of us  to drain this poison from our society and to take on this warped ideology that is radicalising some of our young people.  The murder of David Haines at the hands of ISIL will not lead Britain to shirk our responsibility  with our allies  to deal with the threat this organisation poses.  It must strengthen our resolve.  We must recognise that it will take time to eradicate a threat like this.  It will require  as I have described  action at home and abroad.  This is not something we can do on our own – we have to work with the rest of the world.  But ultimately our security as a nation  the way we go about our everyday lives in this free and tolerant society that is Britain  has always depended on our readiness to act against those who stand for hatred and who stand for destruction.  And that is exactly what we will do.,HER,status
I want no-one in Scotland to be in any doubt: we want you to stay.  So please join me in signing this important letter to the people of Scotland  and let's keep our proud family of nations together.,HER,link
My message to the Scottish people is simple: 'We want you to stay.' Please read and share this article with friends:  As the people of Scotland put pen to ballot paper next week  you will be writing the UK’s future in indelible ink. It’s a momentous decision: there will be no going back.  That is why the main party leaders – Ed Miliband  Nick Clegg and I – have agreed the right place for us to be today is in Scotland  not at Prime Minister’s Questions in Westminster. There is a lot that divides us  but there’s one thing on which we agree passionately: the United Kingdom is better together. At this crucial moment  we want to be listening and talking to voters about the huge choices they face. Our message to the Scottish people will be simple: ‘We want you to stay.’  It’s difficult to put into words what our United Kingdom represents. This is the group of small islands in the North Atlantic that have punched above our weight for centuries – and we’ve done so together.  When the world wanted representation  we gave them democracy. When they wanted progress  we had the Scottish enlightenment and the industrial revolution.  When slavery bound innocent people  we abolished it; when fascism threatened freedom  we defeated it. A hundred years ago  our boys went off to war together – and they did so as comrades  united by purpose and hope for a better world.  As individuals and as nations  we have done extraordinary things. This is the special alchemy of the UK – you mix together Scotland  England  Wales and Northern Ireland and together we smash expectations.  And that’s just as true today as it’s ever been. Together we ensure that the sick are cared for in our NHS; that no one has to reach for their credit card to get decent medical help.  Together we ensure dignity and security for our elderly  with a pension system that we all pay into  from Land’s End to John O’Groats. Together  the United Kingdom embodies the values that the world looks on with awe and envy.  Just because our countries are great together  that does not mean we cannot be even better. That is why a No vote doesn’t mean a vote for the status quo – No doesn’t mean no change. It means significant further devolution for Scotland – major new powers over tax  spending and welfare all being passed to Scotland.  This is not about Scotland versus the rest of the United Kingdom. It is about two competing visions of Scotland’s future.  This week  the No campaign set out more detail on this. Power for Scotland over how much money it borrows  what taxes it raises  how it spends that money – all agreed by November  all put into draft legislation by January. This is the package that Gordon Brown outlined on Monday. It is one I wholeheartedly support. Because we know that brighter future for Scotland rests not only on staying in the UK  but also on having significant new powers.  This is the sort of clarity you need as you make this decision  knowing how it will affect your life  your job  the security of your country  the money in your pocket – especially when you’re not just making this decision for yourself  but for your children  your grandchildren  and their children too.  With this timetable  we are giving people that clarity  showing that by voting No  Scotland gets the best of both worlds: power over the policies that matter  and the stability of the United Kingdom; the freedom to chart its own destiny  and the support of three other nations; the reputation in the world as a successful nation  and the clout of a world-renowned union.  But where we offer clarity  those who support separation offer only question marks. Just eight days away from the referendum  they are still unclear on what money Scotland could use without the pound sterling. The plan for Scotland to enter the EU is a blank page. The formula for filling the public services funding deficit is a blank space. While a Yes vote may be a lucky dip  a No vote is a guaranteed win for anyone who wants a stronger  more autonomous Scotland.  The United Kingdom is a precious and special country. That is what is at stake. So let no one in Scotland be in any doubt: we desperately want you to stay; we do not want this family of nations to be ripped apart. Across England  Northern Ireland and Wales  our fear over what we stand to lose is matched only by our passion for what can be achieved if we stay together.  If we pull together  we can keep on building a better future for our children. We can make sure our destiny matches our history  because there really will be no second chances. If the UK breaks apart  it breaks apart forever.  So the choice for you is clear: a leap into the dark with a Yes vote  or a brighter future for Scotland by voting No. You can have the best of both worlds in the UK. You can have more powers in Scotland. And you can be part of a United Kingdom – standing tall  forging a more secure future in this world  building more opportunities for our children and grandchildren and the generations yet to be born. That is the next chapter in our history; we can write it together – but only if Scotland votes No next week.,HER,status

Like the horror of Lockerbie in 1988 when I was a young man  the images of the burnt-out Malaysian plane  298 victims and their personal effects strewn across the wheatfields and villages around Grabovo in eastern Ukraine will never leave me.  Ten of our own citizens died; we grieve for them this weekend. So too did 27 Australians  including members of a family who had previously lost relatives on flight MH370; 43 Malaysians and 192 Dutch citizens also died — a huge blow to our friends and allies. We stand shoulder to shoulder with those countries and with all those affected by this outrage.  But alongside our sympathy there is also anger. Anger that this could happen; anger that a conflict that could have been stopped by Moscow has been fomented by Moscow; anger that some in the West  instead of finding the resolve to deal with this issue  have simply hoped it would go away.  We must establish the full facts of what happened. But the growing weight of evidence points to a clear conclusion: that flight MH17 was blown out of the sky by a surface-to-air missile fired from a rebel-held area.  If this is the case then we must be clear what it means: this is a direct result of Russia destabilising a sovereign state  violating its territorial integrity  backing thuggish militias and training and arming them.  We must turn this moment of outrage into a moment of action. Action to find those who committed this crime and bring them to justice. But this goes much wider than justice.  In Europe we should not need to be reminded of the consequences of turning a blind eye when big countries bully smaller countries. We should not need reminding of the consequences of letting the doctrine of “might is right” prevail. We should not need to be reminded of the lessons of European history.  But we do. For too long there has been a reluctance on the part of too many European countries to face up to the implications of what is happening in eastern Ukraine.  Sitting around the European Council table on Wednesday evening I saw that reluctance at work again.  Some countries  with Britain at the forefront  have consistently pushed for action that reflects the magnitude of the long-term threat. They tend to be the countries with the closest physical proximity to Russia and the most direct experience of what is at stake. Their own independence and nationhood have come at a high price. They never forget it. But others seem more anxious to make this a problem to be managed and contained  not a challenge to be met and mastered.  Elegant forms of words and fine communiqués are no substitute for real action. The weapons and fighters being funnelled across the border between Russia and eastern Ukraine; the support to the militias; the half-truths  the bluster  the delays. They have to stop.  Some international crises are insoluble. Not this one. If President Vladimir Putin stops the support to the fighters in eastern Ukraine and allows the Ukrainian authorities to restore order  this crisis can be brought to an end. Of course there must be proper protections for Russian-speaking minorities. These issues can be addressed. But the overriding need is for Russia to cease its support for violent separatists.  If President Putin does not change his approach to Ukraine  then Europe and the West must fundamentally change our approach to Russia.  This is not about military action  plainly. But it is time to make our power  influence and resources count.  Our economies are strong and growing in strength. And yet we sometimes behave as if we need Russia more than Russia needs us and the access we provide to European markets  European capital  our knowledge and technological expertise.  We don’t seek a relationship of confrontation with Russia. But we must not shrink from standing up for the principles that govern conduct between independent nations in Europe and which ultimately keep the peace on our continent.  So let us be clear about what needs to happen.  First  there must be immediate access to the crash site and the crime scene must be preserved. The remains of the victims must be identified  treated with proper respect and dignity and returned to their families. There must be a ceasefire. And there must be a full investigation into what happened. Russia will have plenty of information about these events which it must make fully available — and straight away.  Second  Russia must immediately halt supplies and training for the rebels. They do not represent the people of Ukraine. Without Russian support they will wither.  Finally  we must establish proper long-term relationships between Ukraine and the European Union; between Ukraine and Russia; and  above all  between Russia and the European Union  Nato and the wider West.  What form that relationship takes rests on how Russia responds to this appalling tragedy. Russia can use this moment to find a path out of this festering  dangerous crisis. I hope it will do so. But if that does not happen then we must respond robustly.  Nearly 25 years ago Britain hosted the Nato summit that ended the Cold War and began the process of ushering Russia back into the councils of the world.  In six weeks’ time Britain will host a Nato summit in Wales at which the relationship with Russia will again take centre stage. It is up to Russia which path that relationship now takes.,HER,status

This weekend  many people will have received their postal votes for the European and local elections. If your pencil is hovering over the Conservative box — or if you’re wondering whether you’ll make it to the postbox at all — I’m writing this directly to you.  People used to say there is no choice in politics anymore. With these elections  that has been blown apart. There is a vigorous national debate going on  with clear water between all the different parties.  I welcome that — and here I want to tell you the three things that distinguish the Conservative Party from the rest.  First: while other parties talk  Conservatives deliver. Nowhere is that more true than in Europe. Labour and the Liberal Democrats pay lip service to public opinion  but in reality think there’s barely any need for change in Europe. Ukip talk about the national interest  then vote against it.  Beyond the mood music  there is only one party with a credible plan in Europe. I have set out  very clearly  the key areas we are renegotiating on: keeping our border controls; cracking down on benefit tourism; securing more trade; getting more control over justice and home affairs; and getting Britain out of “ever closer union”.  Once we’ve negotiated  whatever the outcome  the British people will have the final say on our future in Europe  with that in-out referendum in 2017.  If you’re reading this thinking “I’ve heard all this before” – I get it. I was watching  too  when Labour made Britain the doormat of Europe and signed British taxpayers up to eurozone bail-out funds. So I understand the scepticism.  But if you want proof that we will deliver  just look at our record. Those bail-outs Labour signed us up to? I pulled us out of them. When there was an EU treaty that wasn’t in our interests  I refused to sign it — the first British prime minister to do so. And we are the party who got the EU budget cut for the first time  saving British taxpayers £8.15 billion.  We’ve proved we can deliver. And as for that referendum? I have made a clear and personal commitment: I would not be Prime Minister of a government unless we could carry out our pledge of an in-out referendum. This is a fundamental principle for me.  So the lines are drawn: Labour and the Liberal Democrats won’t give you a say. Ukip can’t give you a say. It’s only the Conservatives who can and will give you a say in that in-out referendum.  The second distinction is this: while other parties favour short-term gimmicks  we have set out a long-term plan that is turning Britain around.  It’s a plan with five parts: reducing the deficit; cutting income tax; backing business to create more jobs; capping welfare and reducing immigration; and delivering the best schools and skills.  It is a plan that is working  with the deficit down by more than a third  26 million people who have had their income tax cut  immigration down  welfare capped  250 000 fewer young people in failing schools and more people in work than ever before.  Most importantly  it is a plan driven by core Conservative beliefs: you shouldn’t spend what you haven’t earned; leave something better to the next generations; work is the best welfare there is; everyone should rise as high as their hard work will take them.  These are the values that inspired Margaret Thatcher to unleash a wave of small businesses and that drove Harold Macmillan to build a property-owning democracy.  Our ultimate goal is not about gilt yields and bond markets  it is to give people more financial security; to give families more peace of mind; to help many more young people make the most of their talents and get on in life.  This is a long-term plan underpinned by our beliefs – and the contrast with Labour is stark. They’ve given us a succession of short-term gimmicks  underpinned by political opportunism: bank taxes they have “spent” 10 times over; an energy policy that turns out to be a con; a housing policy their own shadow housing minister said would not work in practice.  They’re flailing around because  ultimately  they have no ideas beyond the ones that got us into this mess — more spending  more borrowing  more taxes. The only party with a credible  long-term plan is the Conservative Party. The third distinction between us and the other parties is this: optimism vs pessimism.  It’s been said that I was a sunny optimist in Opposition who became a grim realist in Government. I don’t recognise that at all. I am more optimistic about Britain’s future than I have ever been. That’s because I’ve been to hundreds of offices  warehouses and labs across this country and seen Britain coming back.  I’ve seen it in the faces of the entrepreneurs who come to Downing Street who have been unemployed  who got a £3 000 loan from the Government and who are now running their own businesses. This is optimism based on fact  not just faith.  But there are politicians who refuse to be upbeat about Britain. To them  pessimism equals patriotism. They insist that our best days are behind us and that everything is bound to get worse. Like Pte Frazer politicians  they are perennially crying out that “we’re all doomed”.  To me  real patriotism isn’t running your country down at every opportunity  it is seeing its strengths and building on them — because time and again  the doom-mongers turn out to be wrong.  A few years ago  they said Britain was down and out; but now we’re one of the fastest growing economies in the developed world. They said: “Jobs will be sucked away from our shores  never to return.”  But in recent years  we’ve seen several companies move production and services back to Britain  such as Hornby from India to Sussex  or EE from the Philippines to Northern Ireland.  The doom-mongers predicted that reducing public spending would slash a million jobs; but we’ve got 1.5 million more people going out to work. They said that if there was a recovery  it would only be in London and the South East. But today  where are exports growing fastest? The West Midlands. Indeed  exports from there are set to grow three times faster than Germany’s by 2017.  There is so much cause for confidence in Britain today. We have four of the world’s top 10 universities. We have a higher employment rate than the USA for the first time since the Seventies. And we  the discoverers  inventors and chroniclers of gravity  DNA  penicillin and the web  are inventing more of the products and ideas that are shaping our world: the chip in your smartphone  the bionic arm  the latest in artificial intelligence.  We are not just celebrating this success  we’re building on it: the first nuclear power station for a generation  the first new railway line north of London for 120 years  the biggest construction project in Europe in Crossrail. The Conservative Party is optimistic about Britain  and unashamedly thinking big for Britain. That is real patriotism.  So this is what the Conservatives offer: delivery over talk. Plans over gimmicks. Optimism over pessimism. Above all  the passionate confidence that Britain is on the right track. If you believe these things too  then please — get out to vote  post your ballot  and have your say. Your vote matters.,HER,status

The General Election is one year away. For each of those 365 days  the Conservatives have one clear message: we are the team that is turning Britain around.  We have set out a serious  long-term economic plan: reducing the deficit  cutting income taxes  backing business  capping welfare  reducing immigration  delivering the best schools and skills - and that plan is working for families across our country.  The deficit has been cut by over a third. Our economy is now one of the fastest growing in the developed world. 1.5 million more people are now in work. Immigration is down. Welfare has been capped. And something I'm very proud of: today 250 000 fewer children are being taught in underperforming schools.  All this means more peace of mind for families  more young people with the chance to get on in life  and more financial security for people across our country.  From the ashes of the Great Recession we are building a Great British revival.  But make no mistake: all this is at stake a year from now. Labour's only plans are for more spending  more borrowing  more debt - more of the same that got us into the mess. They would ruin the progress that has been made.  So our message is clear  consistent and unrelenting: the Conservatives are the ones with the long-term economic plan that is working. If we want to continue this Great British revival  and keep on turning our country around  we've got to keep working through this plan.  That's why I'm asking you to back the plan that is turning our country around by donating £10 today: https://www.conservatives.com/donate?code=YearToGo  Thanks  David Cameron,HER,link

Easter is not just a time for Christians across our country to reflect  but a time for our whole country to reflect on what Christianity brings to Britain.   Every day  there are countless acts of kindness carried out by those who believe in and follow Christ: the Alpha courses run in our prisons  giving offenders a new life inside and outside prison; the support networks run by our churches; and the shelter and food given to those affected by the terrible flooding earlier this year by churches and their congregations.   The heart of Christianity is to ‘love thy neighbour’ and millions of people in this country really do live that out.   I’d like to wish everyone  Christians and non-Christians alike  a very happy Easter.,HER,status

I pledge to give power back to the people if Labour are elected - my article in today's Mirror:  "Just as they are skewing economic life so that wealth is funnelled towards the 1% and away from working people  so now the party of privilege is taking us back to the days when the people were locked out of power. ... So I beg of you: do not choose inaction over rightful anger. Don’t be silenced. Register to vote. Defend your trade unions. Be a thorn in the Government’s side. Stand up against the one-party state.  The defence of our liberty begins today.",HER,link
I've just released this statement in response to Jeremy Hunt’s announcement that he will impose a contract on junior doctors:  Jeremy Hunt's decision to impose a contract on junior doctors is provocative and damaging. Rather than helping to resolve this difficult dispute  his action will only inflame it.  The BMA has continued to table proposals to settle the dispute. The fact that the Health Secretary is now simply trying to impose his will rather than negotiate  demonstrates a lack of confidence in his own arguments.  We need to recognise the huge contribution junior doctors make and the years of training they go through to look after us. These are people dedicated to our health and our NHS.   Patients  doctors  the BMA and the public want an agreed settlement. What is now keeping this dispute going are the actions of the Secretary of State himself.  More strikes now look likely. If that happens  it will be clear that the blame lies with the government  not the doctors.  Even at this late stage  I appeal to Jeremy Hunt to go back and negotiate with the BMA.  This government is reckless with our NHS and is now prepared to put patient care at risk in the service of its self-defeating austerity programme.,HER,photo
Today I went to the Grande-Synthe refugee camp  near Dunkirk  and the emergency refugee camp in Calais  in northern France.  The plight of thousands of refugees in Calais and Dunkirk  destitute and forced to live in inhuman conditions  is an affront to our common humanity which demands action by both France and Britain.   We must reach out the hand of humanity to the victims of war and brutal repression. Along with other EU states  Britain needs to accept its share of refugees from the conflicts on Europe’s borders  including the horrific civil war in Syria.   We have to do more. As a matter of urgency  David Cameron should act to give refuge to unaccompanied refugee children now in Europe – as we did with Jewish Kindertransport children escaping from Nazi tyranny in the 1930s.   And the government must provide the resources needed for those areas accepting refugees – including in housing and education - rather than dumping them in some of Britain’s poorest communities.,HER,photo
Last week  I responded to a question from Stylist magazine about my "object of desire." I said it was an aluminium-framed Raleigh Criterium bicycle.  I could not have imagined when I replied that a crowdfunder would be set up to buy me this bike. People’s generosity has been remarkable and incredibly the total raised is over £6 000. The average donation was £2.70.   I’d like to say a huge thanks to every person that has donated. It’s truly humbling and I’m pleased that others will now benefit from this – as the organisers have suggested that they donate the substantial excess money raised to a charity of their choice. I will also be donating the cost of the bike to charity.,HER,link
At Prime Minister's Questions today  I asked David Cameron about his plans to abolish maintenance grants and remove bursaries from student nurses.   500 000 students are currently entitled to maintenance grants  which act as a lifeline for students from less well-off backgrounds.  In the last parliament  Cameron trebled tuition fees to £9 000 per year and these latest proposals will only worsen the financial situation for students leaving university and trying to start a career.   The Tories have no mandate to abolish maintenance grants or nurses' bursaries - neither proposal was in their manifesto.   Here  I asked Cameron a question from Liam  a student who wishes to be a maths teacher  who raised concerns that he'll be saddled with more than £50 000 of debt after he graduates.    David Cameron replied  "what I'd say to Liam  and I wish him well  is that he will not pay back a penny of his loan until he is earning £21 000."   The Prime Minister wishing Liam well is of little help and as I pointed out  Liam says his salary as a teacher will be £25 000 so he'll be paying back this debt from day one of his new career.,HER,video
Everybody in Britain recognises and is grateful for the hard work and long hours put in by junior doctors.  Their treatment by this government has been nothing short of appalling  leading to the strike action in our NHS today.   No NHS worker takes lightly the decision to strike  but the blame must be laid at the door of this government for the way it has treated doctors and now seeks to smear them in the press. It is time for this government to apologise to junior doctors and negotiate a fair deal that gets our NHS working again.,HER,photo
I wrote a piece in The Mirror this morning:  "There has been a lot of media coverage around my reshuffle this week which was about securing a stronger Labour leadership team.  While it was going on we were holding the government to account on floods  Europe and its support for Saudi Arabia.  Holding the government to account is our first priority. ... The Conservatives are running down our country. Their neglect of our public services is damaging people’s lives and taking away vital securities and opportunities. ... It’s time to focus our fire on the Tories.",HER,link
At Prime Minister’s Questions today  I asked David Cameron about the floods that have affected so many families and businesses across the country. He ignored my questions about specific flood defences that have not received the funding required  resulting in so much devastation.  I asked what lessons had been learnt from the floods we experienced just one year ago. I also asked why flood defences in Leeds were cancelled and why Cumbria County Council's application for funding for flood defence schemes for Keswick and Kendal were turned down.   I spoke to a couple in York whose house had been flooded  which was especially difficult for them to accept as a Government report had flagged up the insufficient capacity of flood pumps in their area only three years ago. Cameron avoided my question as the Government did nothing.    I went on to ask about the importance of the Fire & Rescue Service being given a statutory duty to deal with floods as they carry so much responsibility in the aftermath of floods but without adequate resources or recognition. And again  no response from Cameron.,HER,video

I am challenging the Prime Minister to an annual televised ‘state of the nation’ debate of the party leaders.   People are entitled to know more about their political leaders and to have their government held to account by the elected opposition in every way possible.  It is crucial that the Prime Minister and Government are held to account  both inside and outside Parliament  throughout their period in office – not just at election time.  Bringing politics to the people.,HER,link
I wrote a Christmas message in The Mirror earlier this week.  ....We should always be asking ourselves – all of us  not just politicians – whether we could do more for others.  In this way  the Christmas story holds up a mirror to us all. “Do unto others as you would have done to you” – that is the essence of my socialism  summed up in the word ­“solidarity”.  The concept of solidarity is about our unity – we succeed or fail together. Yet too often there are attempts to divide us  to scapegoat  rather than help  those in need.  Jesus said: “It is more blessed to give than to receive”.  It is a similar maxim that inspired our party: “From each according to their means  to each according to their needs.”,HER,link

Parliament has just voted to launch airstrikes in Syria. I am reminded of the messages I have received in recent days from my constituents who have expressed deep concern for family in Syria. I also think of our armed forces whose lives will be put in danger.   The fact of the matter is  David Cameron’s case was not convincing  lacking either credible ground troops or a plan for a diplomatic settlement. Since he first made his case for airstrikes in Syria  last Thursday  opposition has mounted; in the country  in parliament and in the Labour Party.   It is impossible to avoid the conclusion that the Prime Minister realised opposition to his ill thought-out rush to war was growing – and he needed to hold the vote before it slipped from his hands. I have argued  and will continue to do so  that we should re-double our efforts to secure a diplomatic and political end to the conflict in Syria.  British service men and women will now be in harm’s way and the loss of innocent lives is sadly almost inevitable.,HER,status
Politics is about passion  values and principles.  I joined the Labour Party because of the beliefs it stood for and now as its leader I want us as a party to return to our collective Labour principles that our great party was founded on.  I want a great debate within the party  I want all our members to have the opportunity to help create the policies that will lead us to victory in 2020. With a party of over 380 000 members we will not always agree and I think that is healthy for our party democracy.  But democratic debate comes with responsibilities – the responsibility of respect for others  even if they don’t agree with you. Over recent days I have received a number of reports that there have been some incidents where Labour Party members and MPs have been abused. Unfortunately the Prime Minister took part in this himself by downgrading this debate by calling those who vote against extending airstrikes “terrorist sympathisers.”   I want to be very clear – there is no place in the Labour Party or from those that support us - for bullying of any sort  from any side of the debate. It flies in the face of everything I believe and everything I stand for.   Let us – all of us in the Labour Party - focus on building a party that can win in 2020. Let’s do that in a comradely fashion.  Let's turn out and together take the opposition to the Tories and deliver a Labour government the country so desperately needs; housing for all  a world class national health system  well-paid and high-skilled jobs – an equal and fair society.,HER,status
Ahead of today's vote on extending bombing to Syria  I wrote an article in the Mirror.   I summarised that  "We are in the fifteenth year of the War on Terror. The UK has taken part in wars in Afghanistan  Iraq and Libya.  Given the current terror threat it is obvious that these wars have not achieved their aims.  There is now a clear risk that extending UK bombing to Syria will threaten  rather than protect  our national security.  Only a negotiated settlement of the Syrian conflict  backed by all the main countries in the region will beat Isis.  Dropping more bombs without a proper plan risks spreading the war and playing into the hands of ISIS.",HER,link
I was interviewed a little earlier today on BBC News  by Laura Kuenssberg about the vote tomorrow on whether Britain should take part in the bombing of Syria.   Sadly  there has been too much focus on process  whereas the debate should be about war and peace. Frankly  the Prime Minister has not made a convincing case for war  as I said in this interview:  “There are ordinary people in Raqqa  just like you and me  who don’t want to be bombed; there are refugees that have come out of Raqqa  who say  ‘please don’t bomb’; there are also question marks about the PM’s claim that there is an army of 75 000 people ready to join in support of these strikes - that argument seems to be unravelling as the hours go by.”,HER,video
60 Years ago today  Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat to a white passenger on a segregated bus in Montgomery  Alabama. This simple act of civil disobedience to defend human dignity was one of the most important events in the civil rights movement history.   Parks’ actions resounded far beyond Montgomery  stimulating activism across America and it quickly became a symbol of resistance against institutionalised racism.    Our history is made by ordinary people doing extraordinary things. Rosa Park’s example gave hope and courage to a generation. One woman’s bravery 60 years ago continues to provide inspiration to new generations across the world .,HER,photo
This morning I was on the Andrew Marr Show  discussing my position on Britain extending bombing from Iraq to Syria.   It is the conflicts in Syria and Iraq which created the conditions for Isis to thrive and spread its murderous rule. And it is through political agreement to end the civil war - negotiated with all the external powers  backed by the United Nations and with Syrians in control of their own country - that Isis will be isolated and defeated.   As the US president Barack Obama said recently  Isis “grew out of our invasion of Iraq” and is one of its “unintended consequences”. We must not keep making the same mistake - again and again. Labour will always stand up to any threat to this country and our people. We will never leave Britain unprotected  but we need a different approach to foreign policy that puts peace  justice and real security first.,HER,video
David Cameron is preparing to ask MPs  for a second time in two years  to vote for militarily intervention in Syria.   Labour will consider his proposals  but in our view  the dreadful Paris attacks strengthens the case for an international effort to reach a negotiated settlement of the Syrian civil war - and end the threat from Isis.   It is the conflict in Syria and the consequences of the Iraq war which have created the conditions for Isis to thrive and spread its murderous rule.   It is vital at a time of tragedy and outrage not to be drawn into responses which feed a cycle of violence and hatred. As the US president Barack Obama said recently  Isis “grew out of our invasion of Iraq” and is one of its “unintended consequences”.   We must not keep making the same mistake - again and again.,HER,video
"People are fed up with a so-called free market system that has delivered grotesque inequality  stagnating living standards for the many  calamitous foreign wars without end and a political stitch-up which leaves the vast majority of people shut out of power or influence."  This was the beginning of a speech I gave in Bristol yesterday. A speech that outlines the three pillars which everything we do will be based on:  The first pillar is the new politics: the democratisation of public life from the ground up. Giving people a real say in their communities and workplaces; breaking open the closed circle of Westminster and Whitehall  and boardrooms too.  The second pillar of our project for Britain is a new economy. It’s anti-austerity economics; that goes without saying. Austerity is a political choice  not an economic necessity. But what Labour now stands for is far more than stopping the damage being done by the Tories. We want to see a break with the failed economic orthodoxy that has gripped the establishment for decades. We want to see the reindustrialization of Britain for the digital age.  The third pillar of our vision for Britain is a different kind of foreign policy - based on a new and more independent relationship with the rest of the world. A relationship where war is a last resort. We must reflect on the past 14 years  that has seen Britain at the center of a succession of disastrous wars  that have brought devastation to large parts of the wider Middle East.,HER,video
It's half-time at Wembley. I felt it was vital that I attend  on behalf of the Labour Party  this important and symbolic match between England and France.   Lassana Diarra  the French midfielder whose cousin tragically died on Friday evening and who still might play tonight as he is one of the subs  said earlier this week  "It is important for all of us who represent our country and its diversity to stay united against a horror."  I  along with tens of thousands of fans at today's game and millions watching across the world  want to stand alongside Diarra and all those that have been affected by the appalling events in Paris.   As Diarra also said  we "stand together for love  respect and peace.",HER,photo
Tonight  I will be going to the England vs France match at Wembley stadium. It is important we show solidarity with all those affected by the tragic events that took place in Paris on Friday.   It is right that we are reflecting on the appalling attacks in Paris and how we agree an effective international response. That needs to focus on negotiating a comprehensive settlement of the Syrian civil war through the United Nations  which is the only way to end the threat from ISIS.    That is the serious challenge facing us all. I am therefore disappointed that comments I made yesterday in regard to a "shoot to kill" policy have been taken out of context and have distracted from this discussion.  Nonetheless  I would like to clarify my position. As we have seen in the recent past  there are clear dangers to us all in any kind of shoot to kill policy. And we must ensure that terrorist attacks are not used to undermine the very freedoms and legal protections we are determined to defend.  But of course I support the use of whatever proportionate and strictly necessary force is required to save life in response to attacks of the kind we saw in Paris.,HER,status
This morning I was interviewed by Lorraine on ITV. We spoke about the appalling attacks in Paris.

I've just joined my Labour colleagues  who have voted against the Conservative's Trade Union Bill this evening. This Bill is an affront to democracy and seeks to restrict our Party's relationship with trade unions. 6.4 million British people belong to this mass grass-roots movement - I am proud to be one of them.   There are many worrying aspects of the Bill  including the introduction of a  50% turnout threshold for strike ballots. This is despite many of the MPs who are voting for this Bill not receiving the vote of 50% of their constituents. The Conservatives have said they want to modernise trade unions  but they have denied unions the ability to ballot members by phone or email.  Labour's Shadow Business Secretary  Angela Eagle MP  perfectly summarised this Bill when it was debated on 14 September  “It saddens me beyond words that we’re here today dealing with the most significant  sustained and partisan attack on six million trade union members and their workplace organisations that we have seen in this country in the last 30 years.”,HER,photo
Equal Pay Day - If you are a woman who works full time you will effectively be working for free from now until the end of the year  due to the gender pay gap.  Walking around Parliament  I am reminded of the heroic struggles that have led to greater equality for women  at least in the eyes of the law. Whether Emily Wilding Davison trying to drape this scarf over the King's horse  Marjorie Hume chaining herself to this statue or the Equal Pay Act itself.   The 1968 Ford sewing machinists strike  popularised by the film Made in Dagenham  ensured equal pay was firmly on the agenda and Barbara Castle duly tabled the Equal Pay Bill which came into force fifty years ago.  However  these gains are being eroded: the Conservative's introduction of employment tribunal fees means that it now costs women £1 200 to bring forward an equal pay claim.This has also meant that twice the number of pregnant women and new mothers have been forced out of their jobs compared with a decade ago.   Kate Green MP  Labour's Shadow Minister for Women and Equalities  said today  "It’s no good the Tories talking about equal pay when their policies stop women from getting fair treatment at work.",HER,photo

Today  at Prime Minister's Questions  I put six questions to David Cameron about tax credits cuts.

I wrote to David Cameron on 25 September about Ali Mohammed al-Nimr. Since then  he and a second prisoner  Dawood al-Maroon  who also faces the death penalty  have been moved to solitary confinement while concern for the 74-year old UK pensioner  Karl Andree  facing 360 lashes for possessing alcohol  has grown.  In Cameron's response to me  he explained that the government  had "decided to withdraw their bid entirely" to support Saudi's judicial system. I welcome this decision  but there are still people at the heart of these matters who face brutal punishment and the death penalty.  David Cameron has intervened in the case of Karl Andree but I have written to him again to ask for him to also intervene in Ali Mohammed al-Nimr and Dawood al-Maroon's cases. I have also asked about the process which allowed the prison contract bid to be authorised in the first place and which Minister was responsible  as both these questions were ignored when I first asked them in my previous letter.,HER,photo

On Question Time a mother explained the effects of the tax credits cuts on her family. On Wednesday at PMQs I told David Cameron about Kelly  a single mum of a disabled child who also cannot see how she will be able to provide for her family after these cuts.   People voted for the Conservative government in May because they believed Cameron when he said he would balance the books fairly; instead he is dealing with the deficit on the backs of low and middle income earners  and the poorest. David Cameron categorically denied there would be tax credit cuts because he knew this would be unpopular with the very people he needed to vote for him.   People who voted Conservative in May were misled. This Tory government is not the Party of the British worker  but is the problem for the British worker.,HER,video

On World Homeless Day we must remember housing is a basic human right.  But for too many people housing is a source of insecurity. Many thousands of people are struggling to pay their rent or their mortgage  are struggling with debts and insecurity at work.   In Britain  homelessness is rising  both in terms of those sleeping rough on our streets – and of those families living in temporary accommodation without a permanent home to call their own.  We as a country are not building enough homes. Evictions of private tenants are at a record high. Labour will build the homes that Britain needs and end the scourge of homelessness and housing insecurity to ensure everyone has a secure foundation to realise their potential. But particularly on this World Homeless Day we should consider the millions of refugees displaced from the homes by conflict around the world in places like Syria  Afghanistan and Yemen. We have a duty to those people too  to provide asylum and shelter.  As Maya Angelou said  “The ache for home lives in all of us  the safe place where we can go as we are.",HER,status
It is World Mental Health Day; we should use today to reflect on the difficulties people we know face and think about how we can support them. The Labour Party and our Shadow Minister for Mental Health  Luciana Berger  will champion parity of esteem for mental health across all our services.   I spoke about mental health at the Labour Party Conference last week:  "It’s an issue for all of us. Every one of us can have a mental health problem.  So let’s end the stigma. End the discrimination.  And with Luciana Berger  our Shadow Minister for Mental Health  I’m going to challenge the Tories to make parity of esteem for mental health a reality not a slogan.  With increased funding – especially for services for children and young people.  As three quarters of chronic mental health problems start before the age of 18.  Yet only a quarter of those young people get the help they need. All our work is important on bringing mental health to the forefront of a public understanding and a public debate.    End the stigma  end the discrimination. Treat people with mental health conditions as you would wish to be treated yourself.",HER,video
The Tory conference was a feast of spin and deception.   Fake claims to be on the side of working people while robbing three million low paid families of £1 300 a year with the Tax Credit cuts.   Fake claims to be fighting poverty on the very day independent research revealed their cuts would drive more than 200 000 working households into poverty.   Fake claims to support equality as Theresa May was condemned by the Institute of Directors for jeopardising Britain's economic recovery by pandering to anti-immigration sentiment.   And it wasn't just Theresa May who let the mask slip to reveal how far the Tories are from the common ground. Jeremy Hunt showed low paid workers just what the Tories really think of them when he said their Tax Credits had to be cut to make them graft.   So behind the spin and the rhetoric we could all see out of their own mouths it was the same old Tories. On the side of the few not the many. Robbing millions of Britain's low paid workers to fund an Inheritance Tax cut for the 60 000 wealthiest estates. Whose answer on Tax Credits now is apparently to send families their cuts letter after rather than before Christmas.   Our huge and growing membership  a re-vitalised Labour  is what has rattled Cameron and the Tories. While they hide behind crude personal attacks  we will continue to judge their actions  not their words because Labour stands with the many  the great majority of the British people who demand a fairer and more equal society.,HER,status
I was very pleased to be in Manchester this evening discussing the postal service.  The postal service has been under attack. The privatisation of Royal Mail was wrong. It was handled appallingly and lost the taxpayers vast sums. It has also put the universal postal service under threat.   The postal service is invaluable. That is why hundreds upon hundreds (I'm told 4 000) turned up to this meeting; so much so the street was full of people who couldn't get in. Not only do they care about their postal service  they also want the people who deliver their post to be paid a decent wage and have the workers' rights they are entitled to.,HER,photo
Ahead of the Conservative Party Conference  I urge all activists (Labour or not) to focus solely on policy and not to take part in any personal attacks. Misogyny and cyberbully have no place in our society. As I said in my speech at the Labour Party Conference:   "There’s another important thing about how we are going to do this. It’s a vital part of our new politics. I want to repeat what I said at the start of the leadership election. I do not believe in personal abuse of any sort.    Treat people with respect. Treat people as you wish to be treated yourself. Listen to their views  agree or disagree but have that debate. There is going to be no rudeness from me. Maya Angelou said: "You may not control all the events that happen to you  but you can decide not to be reduced by them."   I want a kinder politics  a more caring society. Don’t let them reduce you to believing in anything less.   So I say to all activists  whether Labour or not  cut out the personal attacks; the cyberbullying; and especially the misogynistic abuse online. And let’s get on with bringing values back into politics.",HER,video
This morning I had breakfast in Social Bites in Glasgow. This is a great cafe where as well as buying something for yourself you can buy a homeless person food through their ‘Suspended Coffee and Food’ initiative.

Lovely place to end up in before heading home from my trip to Scotland.,HER,photo
Here's my full speech from Annual Conference today.   "They [the Tory government] want us to believe there is no alternative to: - Cutting jobs. - Slashing public services. - Vandalising the NHS. - Cutting junior doctor’s pay. - Reducing care for the elderly. - Destroying the hopes of young people for a college education or putting university graduates into massive debt.  - Putting half a million more children in poverty.  They want the people of Britain to accept all of these things.   They expect millions of people to work harder and longer for a lower quality of life.   Our Labour Party says no. The British people never have to take what they are given. ... Don’t accept injustice  stand up against prejudice. Let us build a kinder politics  a more caring society together. Let us put our values  the people’s values  back into politics.",HER,video

Yesterday I wrote to David Cameron about the Saudi protester  Ali Mohammed al-Nimr  who was arrested as a child in 2012 and sentenced to death.    As I explained to the Prime Minister  Ali has now exhausted all his appeals and could be executed any day – in a particularly horrific manner  which involves beheading and the public display or ‘crucifixion’ of the body.  You can read my full letter below. Among other points  I asked Cameron  "Will you step in to terminate the Ministry of Justice's bid to provide services to the Saudi prisons system - the very body  I should stress  which will be responsible for carrying out Ali's execution?"   I urged Cameron to act to prevent this grave injustice because there is no time to spare.  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34365856,HER,photo
Ahead of tomorrow's first anniversary of the disappearance of the 43 students in Mexico (from the Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers’ College) I have just written a letter to the UK Mexican Ambassador.   I have expressed my concern about the investigation which the International Group of Independent Experts (GIEI) found that there were at best serious omissions in the Mexican government’s investigation.   Unfortunately the Ayotzinapa 43 are not an isolated case as it has been reported that more than 25 000 people have disappeared in Mexico since 2006.   I have asked the Mexican Ambassador to support the parents of those who were disappeared who ask for the GIEI recommendations to be taken into account and to extend the GIEI’s mandate for them to continue their investigation without interference.,HER,photo
I am very pleased to hear the breaking news that Shaker Aamer will be released from Guantanamo Bay. He is the last Briton to be detained there despite never being brought to trial after his arrest in 2001.   I attended an all-party delegation to Washington  in May of this year  which demanded his release. The pressure mounted by the British parliament contributed to today’s decision  but we must recognise the steadfastness of his family and the commitment of all those who joint this campaign  whether they lobbied their MPs or demonstrated on the streets outside parliament against this clear injustice.  This is a hugely important development and we must praise the important role those campaigners made in bringing about this decision.,HER,photo
I am shocked and saddened to hear of today’s events in Saudi Arabia. My thoughts are with the friends and families of all those affected as well as Muslims in Britain and around the world.  Despite this tragic incident  on behalf of the Labour Party  I want to send my best wishes to all Muslims in the United Kingdom celebrating Eid al-Adha.   This is a special time for Muslims  and it is an opportunity to celebrate the values of Islam. These are values of family  of community and of charity. At a time when so many people around the world are facing such hardship  these values seem more important than ever.   I also want to take this chance to recognise the enormous contributions Muslims across Britain make to our country  to our communities and to our way of life.   Eid Mubarak.,HER,status

Since Saturday evening  I have received an incredible 40 192 questions from people across our country to ask David Cameron at PMQs. If you were one of the people that sent me one - thank you. It is so exciting to be part of this extraordinary  democratic movement.  I put six of these questions to David Cameron this afternoon in Parliament.  I am so proud to have had the chance to stand up and put the experiences and questions of ordinary people directly to David Cameron. They need to be heard. We have shown there is a way to bring the people right into the heart of Westminster.  More than 2 500 of the questions I received were on housing  so the first two that I put to David Cameron this morning were from Marie and Steven:  “What does the government intend to do about the chronic lack of affordable housing and the extortionate rents some private landlords charge?” - Marie  Sudbury  “Have you thought about the impact on people with your housing policy of the 1% cut to rents. Our company will have to make major cuts with the loss of over 150 people by March next year and more to follow the following year. Which will also mean to our tenants less upgrading to properties and repairs.” - Stephen  Following the vote yesterday  we had over 1 000 questions on tax credits  so the next questions I asked were from Paul and Claire:  “Why is the government taking tax credits away from families? We need this money to survive and so our children don't suffer. Paying rent and Council tax on a low income doesn't leave you much  so tax credits play a vital role and more is needed to stop us needing to use food banks?” - Paul  Neston  “How is changing the thresholds of entitlement for tax credits going to help hard working families? I work part time and my husband works full time earning 25k  and we have 5 children. This decrease in tax credits will see our income plummet. How is this fair?” - Claire  Leigh  Finally  we had more than 950 questions submitted on mental health  so I ended by putting Gail and Angela’s questions forward:  “Do you think it is acceptable that mental mental health services in this country are on their knees?” - Gail  “Beds are unobtainable with the result that people suffering serious mental health crises are either left without adequate care or  alternatively  admitted to facilities hundreds of miles away from their homes  relatives and familiar support systems. The situation is simply unacceptable.” - Angela (mental health professional)  Thank you again to everyone who shared their questions with me. I promise that I am going to keep doing politics differently; and I hope you will continue on this journey with me.,HER,video
Yesterday was an incredible day and the culmination of an inspiring campaign.  I made my way to the Special Conference for the announcement of the Labour Deputy and Leader with some of the volunteers who have worked so hard this week.   I then signed the Electoral Commission paperwork accepting the position of the Labour Party Leader. After congratulating Tom Watson I made my way to the volunteers who had watched the results around the corner.  Then I headed over Parliament Square to join the thousands there who are demanding that that we have a Government that can and will respond properly to the refugee crisis.,HER,photo
"So I say to the new members of the Party  or those who have joined in as registered supporters  or affiliated supporters  welcome  welcome to our Party  welcome to our movement. And I say to those returning to the Party  who were in before and felt disillusioned and went away  welcome back. Welcome back to your party  welcome home." - Labour Party special Conference 2015  Non-member  affiliated member  registered supporter? Join this movement https://join.labour.org.uk/standard/2  "Can I start by thanking everyone who took part in this election; this huge democratic exercise of more than half a million people all across this country. It showed our party and our movement passionate  democratic  diverse  united and absolutely determined in our quest for a decent and better society that is possible for all.   There are many people I want to thank before I say a few words if I may  first of all to Iain McNicol the General Sectary of the Party and all of the Labour Party staff for all their incredible hard work during this campaign  the general election campaign  and all the other campaigns that we do and will continue to do. Ian  thank you very much and please make sure that all our staff are aware of the appreciation we have for all of them.   I want also pay huge thanks and tribute to Harriet Harman who has been our acting Leader and our Deputy Leader and before that our acting Leader. I’ve known Harriet for a very long time and what I would say about her is  her absolute commitment and passion for decency and equality and the rights of women in our society is something we will honour her for; thank her for; and we have legislation that was brought about by her determination. Harriet  thank you so much for all you have done  and the way in which you have led the Party since the tragedy of the election result in May.  I want to also thank and congratulate Tom Watson on his election as Deputy Leader of the Labour Party. Tom is passionate about communication; passionate about holding the state and the unaccountable people  who don’t wish to be held accountable  to account. Tom is your man to do that.    I want also to thank Ed Milliband for all the work he did as Leader of our Party. I had a very long conversation with Ed a couple of days ago and I thanked him for all his work as Leader of the Party; I thanked him for his work as Environment Secretary and somebody who is passionate about defending the world’s environment against the way it is being destroyed at the present time. I also thanked him for the way in which he stood up to the abuse that he received from much of our media and the dignity he showed when his late father  the great Ralph Milliband  was so brutally abused by some of our media. So Ed  thank you for all of that.   I want to thank the fellow leadership candidates. We are discussing the number  whether it is 29  35 or 39 hustings we have been to together since this election started. We will discuss that later and exchange diaries. But it has been a fascinating experience for all of us  and I want to thank them for the way that debates were conducted; the way we were able to put forward political debates and political differences and still come out at the end of it with a group hug. We’re going to reform ourselves as an Abba tribute band and continue this work in the future.  Andy Burnham was our Health Secretary and his passion and determination for a National Health Service as a human right  free at the point of use is something that comes over every time Andy speaks. And his passion for comprehensive education; to ensure all children have a reasonable  fair and decent start in life.  I want to say thank you to Yvettte Cooper for all the work she has done in Government and in the Party  but in particular over the past few weeks. Helping to shape and turn around public opinion to show sympathy and humanity towards refugees in the way they are treated. And one of my first acts as the Leader of the Party will be to go to the demonstration this afternoon to show support for the way refugees must be treated and should be treated in this country.  I want to thank Liz Kendall for her friendship during this campaign  for the way we have managed to have some moderately different opinions on a number of issues but we managed to maintain a very good friendship. And Liz is somebody that I admire because she absolutely stands up for what she believes in. Whether it’s easy  simple and popular or it’s uneasy  not simple or popular. So Liz thank you very much.  Those late night train rides will never be the same again. So thank you to my fellow candidates and to the thousands of Party members who attended the hustings events all over the country. It’s quite amazing that every one of them was completely full; standing room only while many  many other members and supporters were not able to get in to them. That is a tribute to our Party  all the candidates  both for Deputy Leader and for Leader - and the way in which our members want passionately to engage in the debate and be able to influence Party policy and make our Party more inclusive  more democratic and their membership better listened to in the future.   I want to thank my own campaign team  they have been absolutely amazing. We came together after we got on the ballot paper - I appreciate with some difficulty. Thank you to the 36 Members of Parliament  well  35 plus me because I nominated myself  and for nominating me for this position. I know some of them had possibly some reluctance to do so  it is reported  but they did so in a spirit of inclusion and democracy  and I thank them for that  and I look forward to working with all of them after this election campaign because we have great work to do in the party. And so our campaign began with very little and we gained support and we gained volunteers.  I thank the unions that nominated me: Unite  Unison  the TSSA  ASLEF  the Communication Workers Union  the Prison Officers Association  the Bakers’ Union  the Socialist Education Association  the Socialist Health Association  and the support received from the RMT union  and the FBU  and all the other unions that took part in this campaign.   We are a Party organically linked together; between the unions and the Party membership  and all the affiliated organisations. That is where we get our strength from. And as a former union organiser in NUPE  now part of Unison  I fully understand the importance of unions at the workplace defending people’s rights standing up for their members and that’s why I don’t appreciate what this Government is trying to do to shackle the unions in the Trade Union bill they are bringing forward on Monday.   Our campaign attracted the support of 16 000 volunteers all over the country  organisers in each part of the country who organised all the events and meetings that we have held  and in total we have done 99 of those events  today is the century.  We are here today at the end of a very long campaign and it’s been quite incredible the numbers of people who have come forward to join our party. But before I get on to that I want to say a big thank you  they all know who they are  my many personal friends  many people  everyone in Islington North Labour Party for electing me to Parliament 8 times up until may this year. Their fantastic comradeship  friendship and support  it’s been quite amazing and I absolutely value their advice  sometimes it’s advice you don’t really want to receive  but that’s the best advice you get. And I say thank you to all of them in Islington North.   And I also say a huge thank you to all of my widest family. All of them. Because they have been through the most appalling levels of abuse from some of our media over the past three months. It’s been intrusive  it’s been abusive  it’s been simply wrong. And I say to journalists - attack public political figures  make criticisms of them  that’s okay  that’s what politics is about - but please  don’t attack people who didn’t ask to be put in the limelight  who merely want to get on with their lives  leave them alone  leave them alone in all circumstances.   During these amazing three months  our party has changed  we’ve grown enormously. We’ve grown enormously because of the hopes of so many ordinary people for a different Britain  a better Britain  a more equal Britain  a more decent Britain. They are fed up with the inequality  the injustice  the unnecessary poverty. All those issues that brought people in  in a spirit of hope and optimism.   And as the media and many of us simply didn’t understand the views of many young people within our society  they had been written off as a non-political generation who were simply not interested  hence the relatively low turnout and low level of registration of young people in the last general election. They weren’t  they are a very political generation that were turned off by the way in which politics was being conducted and not attracted and not interested in it. We have to and must change that.   So  the fight back now of our Party gathers speed and gathers pace. I’m delighted that Kezia Dugdale is here today  our Leader in Scotland  we’re all going to be campaigning in Scotland  for Labour in Scotland with those great traditions; those great labour traditions in Scotland.  I thank Carwyn Jones for his Leadership and the way in which we are going to fight in Wales and I congratulate them on ending the internal market in the health service in Wales something we need to do in the rest of Britain. And I say congratulations to Marvin Rees selected yesterday as our Mayoral Candidate in Bristol. We’re all going to be down there Marvin  helping you and supporting you to win Bristol. And to my friend Sadiq Khan as our Mayoral Candidate in London and we’re going to be campaigning together. We’re going to be campaigning together particularly on the crucial issue of housing in London. I am fed up of the social cleansing of London by this Tory Government and its policies. We need a Labour Mayor in London who can ensure we do house everyone in London; who ends the sky-high rents; we do [need to] end the insecurity of those living in the private rented sector. We need a Labour Mayor to bring that about in this wonderful great City of London. And Sadiq’s the man to do it.  This week the Tories will show what they’re really made of  Monday they have the Trade Union Bill designed to undermine even the ILO conventions and to shackle democratic unions; and destroys another element of democracy in this country and our society  we have to oppose that. They’re also pushing Welfare Reform Bill which will bring such misery and poverty to so many of the poorest in our society. I want us as a movement to be proud  strong and able to stand up and say we want to live in a society where we don’t pass by on the other side [of the street] to those people rejected by an unfair welfare system; instead we reach out to end the scourge of homelessness and desperation that so many people will face in our society. We are strong enough and big enough to be able to do that  which is what we are about.   There are many  many issues we face  many people face desperation in other parts of the world and I think it’s quite incredible how the mood has changed in the past few weeks of understanding that people fleeing from wars  they are the victims of wars  they are the generational victims of wars  they are the intergenerational victims of wars. They end up in desperation  end in horrible places end up trying to gain a place of safety  end up trying to exercise their refugee rights. They are human beings just like you  just like me. Let’s deal with the refugee crisis with humanity  with support  with help  with compassion to try to help people who are trying to get to a place of safety  to try to help people that are stuck in refugee camps but recognise going to war creates a legacy of bitterness and problems.   Let us be a force for change in the world  a force for humanity in the world  a force for peace in the world and a force that recognises that we cannot go on like this with grotesque levels of global inequality  with grotesque threats to our environment all around without rich and powerful governments stepping up to the plate to make sure our world becomes safer and better and that those people do not end up in poverty in refugee camps  wasting their lives away when they could be contributing to the good of all of us on this planet. We are one world let that message go out today from this conference centre in London.   I conclude by this the Tories have used the economic crisis of 2008 to impose a terrible burden on the poorest people of this country  those who have seen their wages frozen or cut  those who can’t afford to even sustain themselves properly  those who rely on foodbanks to get by. It’s not right it’s not necessary and it’s got to change. We need an economic strategy that improves people’s lives that expands our economy that reaches out to care for everybody  you can’t do that if at the same time you do nothing about the grotesque levels of inequality in our society. We need to develop an economic policy that deals with those issues so our party is about justice  is about democracy  it is about the great traditions we walk upon.   Those who founded our party and our movement  those who stood up for human rights and justice  the right for women to vote  the right for others to vote. We stand here today because of their work  but we go forward now as a movement and a party bigger than we’ve ever been for a very  very long time; stronger than we’ve ever been for a very long time; more determined than we’ve been for a very long time. To show to everyone that the objectives of our party are intact  our passion is intact  our demand for humanity is intact. And we as a party are going to reach out to everyone in this country to take us on that journey together so no one is left on the side  everyone has a decent chance in life  and a decent place in our society  that’s what labour was brought about to achieve  that’s what we’re going to achieve.   This election campaign is  as we see here  about shaping our future. Our party is going to become  I hope  more inclusive  more involved  more democratic  and we’re going to shape the future of everyone in this country in a way that I think will be remembered as something that is good for everyone  that brings about the justice that we all crave  and that is what brought us all into this wonderful party and this wonderful movement ourselves. I say thank you to everyone for all their support  friendship and comradeship during this election process. And I say thank you in advance to us all working together to achieve great victories  not just electorally for labour  but emotionally for the whole of our society to show  we don’t have to be unequal  it doesn’t have to be unfair  poverty isn’t inevitable  things can and they will change. Thank you very much.",HER,video
Last Tuesday I launched our Arts for Everyone policy proposals and would like to share that now.  “A successful economy and a healthy  creative  open and vibrant democratic society depend on a flourishing creative sector.  Culture and the arts play an essential role on individual and community wellbeing. If we are to achieve our goal in government of supporting people in leading more enjoyable and fulfilling lives  funding for the arts must be central to that offer.  If elected Labour leader  I pledge to work alongside the creative industries to support  develop  and collectively achieve a culturally rich  more prosperous future for our country.”  http://www.jeremyforlabour.com/corbyn_for_arts_culture  Thank you to the two artists who put this film together.

I am appalled and saddened that in just two years more than 2 500 sick and disabled benefit claimants have died after being found 'fit for work.'  "It is clear that the work capability assessment has failed to adequately assess support needs  and has caused immense distress and suffering for thousands of disabled claimants.  I voted against the legislation [Welfare Reform Act 2007] that introduced the WCA and have campaigned alongside disabled people's organisations to scrap it ever since. The assessment process needs to be completely rebuilt in partnership with disabled people and health professionals."  http://www.jeremyforlabour.com/deaths_whilst_on_incapacity_benefits,HER,photo
I am pleased to launch our ideas and proposals that aim to tackle the mental health crisis:   “Britain has a mental health crisis  and this government is making it worse. The Tory rhetoric about improving mental health provision has been accompanied by cuts in funding  services and support for people with mental health needs.  Everyone knows someone who is suffering or has suffered from mental illness. The economic costs of mental illness are huge  and the personal costs are incalculable.  I am committed to a holistic approach that sees emotional wellbeing as fundamentally connected with a society less atomised and individualistic and more socially connected  more caring  more inclusive and more equal.”  We need a Labour government that will bring this negative narrative on mental health to an end.”  http://www.jeremyforlabour.com/mental_health,HER,link
Thank you to the economists who have come out in support of our economic policies in which they rightly say are not "extreme"  but say it is the "current government’s policy and its objectives which are extreme."   In full:  "The accusation is widely made that Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters have moved to the extreme left on economic policy. But this is not supported by the candidate’s statements or policies.  His opposition to austerity is actually mainstream economics  even backed by the conservative IMF. He aims to boost growth and prosperity. He voted against the shameful £12bn in cuts in the welfare bill.  Despite the barrage of media coverage to the contrary  it is the current government’s policy and its objectives which are extreme. The attempt to produce a balanced public sector budget primarily through cuts to spending failed in the previous parliament. Increasing child poverty and cutting support for the most vulnerable is unjustifiable. Cutting government investment in the name of prudence is wrong because it prevents growth  innovation and productivity increases which are all much needed by our economy  and so over time increases the debt due to lower tax receipts.  We the undersigned are not all supporters of Jeremy Corbyn. But we hope to clarify just where the “extremism” lies in the current economic debate."  http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/23/jeremy-corbyns-opposition-to-austerity-is-actually-mainstream-economics,HER,link

The president’s refusal to negotiate over keeping the government open or his demand for a “clean” debt limit increase is hurting our economy and putting our country at risk. Here’s just a few of the bills his party is blocking in the Senate:,HER,photo
The White House says it’s "winning ” but this isn’t a game. The American people don’t want their government shut down and neither do I.  All we’re asking for is to sit down and have a discussion and to bring fairness - reopen the government and bring fairness to the American people under ObamaCare.,HER,photo
The House is sending bill after bill to the Senate to keep the government open.  One of our latest calls for National Guard and Reserves to get paid  just like the rest of the military.  It is critical that the White House and Senate Democrats work with us to get this done.,HER,photo
Senate Democrats and the White House say they won't work with us on spending  debt  or providing fairness for all Americans under ObamaCare. That's not stopping us from doing the right thing.,HER,photo
House Republicans are advancing straightforward bills to keep our government running. Senate Democrats & the White House? They still won't work with us to get things done for the American people. SHARE to help put pressure on the Senate to act.,HER,photo
Check out my op-ed in USA TODAY on the President’s scorched-Earth policy of refusing to negotiate in a bipartisan way on his health care law  current government funding  or the debt limit. Hope he and his fellow Democrats in the Senate change course soon so we can re-open the gov’t and start getting things done on behalf the American people.,HER,link

The percentage of Americans holding jobs or looking for work has now fallen to its lowest point since 1978. This month alone  312 000 discouraged men and women stopped looking for work – all while the president’s policies  and especially his health care law  continue to make it harder for small businesses to expand and hire. LIKE if you agree we can break out of this ‘new normal’ by repealing ObamaCare  increasing American energy production and building the Keystone XL pipeline  and solving our government’s spending problem.,HER,status
Do you remember when President Obama vowed  “if you like your plan  you can keep your plan?”,HER,link
Check out this NBC News story about employers that are being forced to cut back on worker hours as a result of mandates in the president’s health care law. House Republicans have acted to give individuals and small businesses the same relief from ObamaCare that the president gave to big businesses. As a basic matter of fairness  the Senate should do the same.,HER,link
The IRS needs less power  not more. That’s why today the House acted to #stoptheIRS from implementing or enforcing ObamaCare. I hope the President will support this measure – just like he has supported seven other House-passed bills to repeal or defund parts of the law. In the meantime  our work to dismantle and repeal this train wreck of a law will continue.,HER,status
House Republicans acted this evening to delay both ObamaCare’s employer and individual mandates  protecting ALL Americans from this disastrous law that’s raising costs and costing jobs.  Our position has been clear throughout this debate: if the President is going to offer ObamaCare exemptions to big businesses  families and individuals should get relief too.  Now it’s time for Senate Democrats to do their part to provide #FairnessForAll.,HER,status
If President Obama gets his way  big software companies  big banks  and big government contractors will be exempt from ObamaCare next year. But young people  single parents  and families of four – they’ll be taxed. As a matter of fairness  next week the House will vote to delay both the ObamaCare employer mandate and the ObamaCare individual mandate.  If big businesses get an exemption from this train wreck of a law  the American people should too.,HER,status
The administration’s decision to delay ObamaCare’s employer mandate means even the White House knows the train wreck will only get worse. The law is already raising costs and costing jobs  and today’s announcement only underscores the need to repeal it and replace it with effective  patient-centered reforms.,HER,status
Today the House passed a bill to fully repeal and defund the president’s health care law – which is already raising costs  reducing access to care  and making it harder for small businesses to hire workers.  Check out the results from Team Boehner’s recent health care survey and “like” this post if you support GOP efforts to repeal ObamaCare so we can begin laying the groundwork for patient-centered reforms that lower costs and protect jobs.,HER,photo
Today Senator McConnell and I informed President Obama that we will not be recommending appointments to IPAB – the administration’s health care rationing board that will have the ability to deny seniors access to care.  This unelected  unaccountable board should be scrapped along with all of the president's health care law  which is raising costs and hurting seniors  young people and workers.  Next week the House will vote on full repeal so we can begin laying the groundwork for patient-centered reforms that lower costs and increase access to quality care.,HER,status
Last year  I directed five House committees to investigate the terrorist attack in Benghazi that took the lives of four Americans.

The president’s Health and Human Services Secretary now admits that “there may be a higher cost” for health insurance premiums as a result of ObamaCare.

Earlier today the House voted to overturn the president’s scheduled pay raise and continue the pay freeze for federal employees – including Members of Congress. Until Washington gets serious about addressing its spending problem  and stops making it harder for small businesses to hire  the federal government shouldn’t be giving itself an across-the-board pay raise.,HER,status

Today was supposed to be the day that President Obama submitted his budget. But for the fourth time in five years  it’s late. With high unemployment  high gas prices  and sky-rocketing debt hurting the economy and chasing jobs overseas  it’s long past time President Obama started taking trillion-dollar deficits more seriously.  Later this week  the House will act on a measure to require the President to offer a plan to balance the budget  because we know – and the American people agree – that spending is the problem.,HER,status
President Obama told me several weeks ago at the White House that “we don’t have a spending problem.” Yet when you look at what’s driving our deficits in this chart from the American Enterprise Institute  “it’s spending that’s above normal” while tax revenue is at “its historical average of around 18%.” Washington does have a spending problem  and the sooner Democrats and Republicans come together to make real cuts and meaningful entitlement reforms  the sooner we can begin unleashing robust jobs growth in America.,HER,link
I’m honored to have been elected by my colleagues to continue serving as Speaker of the House for the 113th Congress.  We’ve got a big job  and big challenges.  Our gov’t has built up too much debt.  Our economy is not producing enough jobs.  As I told my colleagues on the House Floor a short time ago  it is time to rise.  When the day is over  and the verdict is read  may it be said that we well and faithfully did our duty to ensure freedom will endure and prevail. So help us God.,HER,status
As the U.S. House waits on Senate Democrats to act on the fiscal cliff  I’ve advised members to stay close to the Capitol this evening in case of further votes. The House has passed legislation to stop ALL tax hikes on families and cut gov’t spending – the real driver of our debt. With hours to go until the January 1st deadline  the Democrats who control the Senate have yet to pass anything.,HER,status
Here’s a copy of a House Budget Committee chart I used at a press conference yesterday to show how Washington’s spending problem threatens our future.  As you can see  the president’s fiscal cliff plan does nothing to address runaway spending.  House Republicans are offering a truly balanced approach to avert the fiscal cliff with significant cuts and new revenue generated by closing special-interest loopholes.  If the president will step up and acknowledge Washington has a spending problem that can’t be fixed with tax increases  I think we can begin to do some real good for our economy over the days ahead.,HER,link
Democratic leaders want to raise tax rates on small businesses instead of cutting spending to avert the fiscal cliff.  That is not the "balanced" approach that was promised to the American people for dealing with the debt.  Where are the Democrats' spending cuts?,HER,status
Raising tax rates  as some have proposed  will slow down our economy  hurt small businesses and destroy more than 700 000 jobs.  Instead of going over the "fiscal cliff " let's focus together on pro-growth tax & entitlement reform to build a stronger  healthier economy.,HER,photo

Private-sector job growth continues to be undermined by the triple threat of higher taxes  more failed ‘stimulus’ spending  and excessive federal regulations.  When President Obama addresses Congress next week  I hope he’ll change course and detail a plan that will remove barriers to private-sector job creation. The American people are still asking  ‘where are the jobs?’ And more government isn't the answer.,HER,status
The bill passed by the House last night isn’t the bill we’d write if conservatives ran Washington  but it’s a step in the right direction.  When I went to NY & said we wouldn’t pass a debt limit increase without spending cuts larger than the hike  skeptics said we were crazy. We’ve proven the skeptics wrong.  When Americans stay engaged in their government  there’s no limit to what can get done.  Keep up the fight.,HER,status
Washington Democrats are all that stand between the American people & a responsible resolution to this debt crisis. The House has now passed not one  but two bills that would cut spending & avoid a national default  while the Senate hasn't even passed a budget. Americans will tolerate the inaction of the Senate no longer. The Senate should pass the House bill at once & send it to the president's desk.,HER,status
As I said tonight  the debate over our job-crushing debt isn't about President Obama and House Republicans.  It's about what’s standing between the American people and the future we seek for ourselves and our families.  The solution to this crisis is not complicated: If you’re spending more money than you’re taking in  you need to spend less of it.,HER,status
Media accounts are speculating about a "deal" between Republicans and the White House that does not exist.

Boehner: "And all we're asking for is Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid and Barack Obama to allow the Congress to vote. There is a majority of the House and the Senate in favor of this bill.

Violent extremism is a challenge to the most fundamental Australian values. We are the most successful multicultural society in the world. None of us can look in the mirror and say "All Australians look like me." Australians look like every race  like every culture  like every ethnic group in the world.   We been able to be so successful because of a fundamental Australian value of mutual respect. It’s the glue that binds this very diverse country together  Every religion  every faith  every moral doctrine understands the golden rule: do unto others as you would have them do unto you. So if we want to be respected  if we want our faith  our cultural background to be respected  then we have to respect others. That is a fundamental part of the Australian project.   Not all extremist talk – intolerant  hateful speech – not all of it leads to violence. But it’s where all violence begins. And we have to call it out. We have to call out the language  the examples of disrespect  the language of hatred wherever it is practised.   Only last night  I spoke with the British Prime Minister David Cameron who of course faces similar – many would say greater – challenges in this area of violent extremism. I look forward to that cooperation and that sharing of experiences being deepened in the weeks and months and years ahead.   It says a lot about Mr Cameron and the shared values and interests of Australia and the United Kingdom that the first thing he said to me was to pass on his condolences for the death of Curtis Cheng  and I rang Curtis' son today and passed on the condolences of the British Prime Minister in addition to my own.

Our thoughts and prayers are with the family of Curtis Cheng  the NSW Police Service employee who was killed yesterday.   Only last week we observed Police Remembrance Day. We must never forget that our security  safety  indeed our democracy depends on the vigilance  professionalism  and courage of our police and security agencies  who every day are putting their lives and safety on the line to keep us safe.  Both State and Federal Governments and all of our agencies are working together seamlessly with a common determined purpose to ensure the security of our nation and its people. This appears to have been an act of politically motivated violence and at this stage appears to have been an act of terrorism. It was a shocking crime. It was a cold-blooded murder  targeting the NSW Police Service.  It was doubly shocking because it was perpetrated by a 15-year-old boy and it underlines the importance of families  communities  leaders being very aware of whether young people are becoming radicalised.   The Australian Muslim community will be especially appalled and shocked by this. We must not vilify or blame the entire Muslim community with the actions of what is  in truth  a very  very small percentage of violent extremist individuals.  The Muslim community are our absolutely necessary partners in combatting this type of violent extremism.   This is Grand Final weekend. We must lead our lives as a strong and confident nation. We have challenges. Terrorism is one of them. But they must never divert us from our commitment to being free Australians  working together to ensure we achieve our common goals.,HER,status

Being sworn-in today at Government House with Lucy and grandson Jack,HER,photo
This has been a very important day in the life of the nation  of the government  and of course of our party. The party room  a little while ago  elected me as leader of the Liberal Party and re-elected Julie Bishop MP as the deputy leader of the Liberal Party.   The burden of leadership is a very heavy one. Tony discharged that as leader of the party and of course as Prime Minister over many years now and the achievements of the government that he has led have been formidable. The free trade agreements that have been negotiated represent some of the key foundations of our future prosperity. And of course restoring the security on our borders has been an extraordinarily important step  enabling us for example to offer the increased and generous arrangements for Syrian refugees last week.  This has been a very sobering experience today. I am very humbled by it.  We need to have in this country  and we will have now  an economic vision  a leadership that explains the great challenges and opportunities that we face.    We cannot be defensive  we cannot future proof ourselves. We have to recognise that the disruption that we see driven by technology  the change is our friend if we are agile and smart enough to take advantage of it. There has never been a more exciting time to be alive than today and there has never been a more exciting time to be an Australian. We will ensure that all Australians understand that their Government recognises the opportunities of the future and is putting in place the policies and the plans to enable them to take advantage of it.,HER,status
The only way that we will remain a high wage  generous social welfare net  first-world society is if we have outstanding economic leadership and if we have strong business confidence.  That is what we  in the Liberal Party  are bound to deliver and it is what I am committed to deliver if the Party Room gives me support as leader of the Party.

Lucy and I were very sad to learn of the death of our friend Malcolm Fraser and we send our condolences to his wife Tamie and their children.  Malcolm Fraser came to the Parliament as a young farmer from the Western Districts of Victoria. He grew into a great leader of the Liberal Party and a reforming  visionary Prime Minister who laid so many of the foundations for the diverse  multicultural nation we are today.  Malcolm was rather shy and often appeared somewhat aloof (not least because of his great height). But those who knew him well saw a warm  droll and often very exuberant man.   In office and out of it he showed himself to have a big and compassionate heart. He introduced the Aboriginal Land Rights Act in 1976 and was a strong campaigner against racism around the world leading the Commonwealth's campaign against white minority rule in Rhodesia and apartheid in South Africa.   Malcolm Fraser’s Government established the Family Court  the Commonwealth Ombudsman  the Human Rights Commission and our first Freedom of Information legislation.   He was a passionate believer in multiculturalism and immigration. He enabled large scale migration from Asia  including over 50 000 refugees from Vietnam. He established the Special Broadcasting Service as a multicultural broadcaster.   Modern Australia would be very different without his vision and leadership.   As Petro Georgiou said when he retired from the Parliament in 2010 "To those who have sought to denigrate Malcolm Fraser I just want to say one thing: Malcolm Fraser's fusion of political toughness  with compassion and social conscience  is simply beyond their comprehension." He was a young Prime Minister and had a long retirement enjoying vigorous good health until his recent illness. He continued to play a very active role in public life  never afraid to criticise governments when in his view they fell short.  I was privileged to work closely with him on the Republic Campaign in 1999.   Malcolm was a fierce political warrior  but over the years he set a great example of the importance of reconciliation and remembering the things that unite us. I think all of us were delighted to see the way in which Malcolm and Gough Whitlam became friends in their retirement and found common ground in several causes whether it was defending Fairfax from takeover or advocating an Australian republic.   Above all he was utterly committed to Australia and its independence and maintained his writing and advocacy on foreign policy right up to his death. A fierce cold warrior during his days in office he became over the years concerned that Australia was too compliant with American foreign policy especially with respect to China.  Indeed his last tweet from 11.20 am on Wednesday this week  little more than a day before he died  was linked to an article about Chinese foreign policy.  Whether one agreed with him or not  in whole or in part  one thing was never in doubt.  Malcolm Fraser was a passionately patriotic Australian with a big  liberal vision for our country and its people.,HER,photo

Visiting the Tesla factory in Fremont  near San Francisco  was a great thrill. The all electric cars are being made in a huge factory that used to belong to GM and Toyota. It shut down and then four years ago Tesla took it over and it went from being an industrial relic to the home of what many regard as the world's fastest and coolest electric car. And many of the workers at Tesla today are auto workers who had been laid off when the old GM/Toyota plant closed. Tesla has gone from employing 500 people to 11 000 in five years. A reminder of how innovation drives jobs.  Walking through the highly automated assembly lines was inspiring  but nothing matched taking a test drive in the latest Tesla S model. This one has a range of 265 miles (about 480 kms) and accelerate to 100 kph in 3.5 seconds. The key of course is the battery technology which is improving all the time both in terms of cost and energy density. Batteries have the potential to revolutionise the energy market  reducing peaking power requirements  optimising grid utilisation of renewables and in some cases enabling consumers to go off the grid altogether. The excitement of technology in the Bay Area is exhilarating.....but not quite as palpable as the jolt you feel when you hit the accelerator! #commsau,HER,photo
Across Australia  thousands of people are becoming Australian citizens today.  Most of us were born here and arrived red faced and screaming into the world as little Aussies. But our new citizens are paying us the greatest compliment - they are choosing to become Australian citizens.  And it is a wise choice.  Our nation is  the home of the world's oldest continuous human culture and the people  our first Australians  whose ancestors have cared for and shaped this land for 40 000 years.  Ours is the most successful multicultural society in the world. No other developed nation has such a large share of its population born overseas and from such a diverse range of cultures and countries.  And yet we have managed to develop our Australian community with very little disharmony. We don't have to look very far to see how rare that is in the world today.  And this has not been an accident. We are united but diverse because we define our national identity not by reference to a race  a religion or ethnic background. Rather our Australian identity  indeed our character  is founded on a unique mix of enlightened political values.  We are a democracy  but not one where the winner takes all. We respect the rule of law that applies to the state as much as it does to the citizen. We are an egalitarian  but not a levelling society. We have a deep sense of a fair go and that is why our society is more caring with more equality of opportunity than many others. And we are respectful of others  easy going  with a live and let live attitude that allows us to be both diverse and united.  We are at once a free and fair society.  Sometimes we fall short of those values  but we should not sell ourselves short.  Our Australian values are worth fighting for  wherever they are challenged.  Most of the time we defend our values best by living them every day.  But during this year especially we should not forget the thousands of Australians who have risked  and are risking  their lives to keep us safe and free.  Relationships which do not just endure  but strengthen  over time are tended with love and mutual respect. And that applies to the relationship we all have with each other as citizens.  For our finest wealth is not the minerals under the ground  or our dazzling natural environment. It is  literally  each other. Our greatest asset is the people of Australia; our family  our friends  our workmates and the millions of fellow Australians we have never met.  So this Australia Day  and every day  let us resolve to work to build on the things that unite us; better understand  in order to resolve  the things that divide us and above all remember that the more we love  respect and support each other  the more we honour and strengthen our nation  Australia.  Have a very happy Australia Day!,HER,photo
A century ago  Australians and Frenchmen were in the trenches of the Western Front fighting and dying to defend France and uphold the freedoms cherished by us both. And our servicemen and women are together in freedom's fight today.  We are heartbroken by the news from Paris and our thoughts and prayers are with the victims  their families and the people of France whose liberty and security has been so grievously attacked in the terrorists' massacre of the staff of the newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris yesterday.  This attack was a murderous assault on civilisation and in particular on one of its key foundations - a free and independent press. It was an attack on every free society and on every journalist  every cartoonist  every newspaper  every broadcaster.  Thousands of Parisians have filled the Place de la Republique to show their solidarity  their compassion  their love of liberty and their determination not to be intimidated by terrorists and their cult of hate and death.   "Je suis Charlie" their signs read.  From Australia  and around the world  we can all say today "Nous sommes aussi Charlie.",HER,status

Earlier today my staff were handed copies of a disgusting  racist leaflet which has apparently been distributed around parts of Wentworth. This hateful rubbish has absolutely no place in Australia.  The author of this poisonous material has chosen to distribute this material to Jewish households during Jewish New Year - a contemptible effort to frighten and intimidate Jews at one of the holiest time in the Jewish calendar.  Racism can only thrive in societies where it is tolerated. We should all condemn this act for what it is; a low and sickening attempt to undermine our nation's  harmony. We should have zero tolerance for racism and hate speech. They are not just a threat to their targets - in this case the Jewish community - but to the whole of our society.  Racism gnaws at the foundations of our successful and harmonious multicultural society and that is why our enemies  be it the authors of this pamphlet or ISIL itself  are so determined to spread hatred  fear and division among us. Each and every one of us  regardless of our racial or cultural background  has a vital vested interest in Australia remaining free of racism and racial hatred.,HER,status

This is not an easy day for many people.   Leadership changes are never easy for our country.   My pledge today is to make this change as easy as I can.  There will be no wrecking  no undermining  and no sniping.  I have never leaked or backgrounded against anyone and I certainly won’t start now.  Our country deserves better than that.  I want our Government and our country to succeed. I always have and I always will.  I have consistently said – in Opposition and in Government – that being the Prime Minister is not an end in itself: it is about the people you serve.  The great privilege that I have had is to see the wonder of this country like few others and I want to thank the Australian people for giving me the honour to serve.  Yes  this is a tough day  but when you join the game you accept the rules.   I have held true to what I believed and I am proud of what we have achieved over the past two years.  300 000 more people are in jobs.   Labor’s bad taxes are gone.

A spotlight is being shone into the dark and corrupt corners of the union movement and Labor’s party/union business model.  We have responded to the threats of terror and we have deployed to the other side of the world to bring our loved ones home.   The boats have stopped – and with the boats stopped  we’ve been better able to display our compassion to refugees.   And despite hysterical and unprincipled opposition  we've made $50 billion of repairs to the budget.   Of course  there's much that I had still wanted to do: constitutional recognition of Indigenous people – getting the kids to school  the adults to work and communities safe.   I was the first Prime Minister to spend a week a year in remote Indigenous Australia  and I hope I'm not the last.   Then there’s the challenge of ice and domestic violence  yet to be addressed.   Australia has a role to play in the struggles of the wider world: the cauldron of the Middle East  and security in the South China Sea and elsewhere.   I fear that none of this will be helped if the leadership instability that's plagued other countries continues to taint us.   But yes  I am proud of what the Abbott Government has achieved.   We stayed focused despite the white-anting.   Of course  the Government wasn't perfect.   We have been a Government of men and women  not a government of gods walking upon the earth.   Few of us  after all  entirely measure up to expectations.   The nature of politics has changed in the past decade.   We have more polls and more commentary than ever before – mostly sour  bitter  character assassination.   Poll-driven panic has produced a revolving door prime ministership which can’t be good for our country and a febrile media culture has developed that rewards treachery.   And if there’s one piece of advice I can give to the media  it’s this: refuse to print self-serving claims that the person making them won't put his or her name to; refuse to connive at dishonour by acting as the assassin's knife.   There are many to thank for the privilege of being Prime Minister.  First and foremost  I thank my family for allowing me to be the absentee spouse and parent that politics entails.  I thank Margie for her grace and dignity throughout my public life.  I thank my party for the privilege of leading it.   I thank the armed forces who are serving our country and defending our values  even as we speak.  I thank my staff who have been absolutely unceasing in their devotion to our party and our country  especially my Chief of Staff who has been unfairly maligned by people who should have known better.  Finally  I thank my country for the privilege of service.  It is humbling to lose  but that does not compare to the honour of being asked to lead.  In my Maiden Speech here in this Parliament  I quoted from the first Christian service ever preached here in Australia.  The Reverend Richard Johnson took as his text  “What shall I render unto the Lord for all his blessings to me?”  At this  my final statement as Prime Minister  I say: I have rendered all and I am proud of my service.  My love for this country is as strong as ever and may God bless this great Commonwealth.,HER,status
I have been heartened by the messages of support flooding into Liberal MPs' offices this evening saying most emphatically  "We are not the Labor Party."   I want to repeat that; I have been most heartened by the messages of support flooding into Liberal MPs' offices saying most emphatically  "We are not the Labor Party."   This country needs strong and stable Government and that means avoiding  at all costs  Labor's revolving-door Prime Ministership.   Since coming to Government  our team has stopped the boats  improved the Budget  cut taxes and increased jobs. We have laid the foundation for a better deal for families and for small business.   You can trust me to deliver a stronger economy and a safer community.   The Prime Ministership of this country is not a prize or a plaything to be demanded.  It should be something which is earned by a vote of the Australian people.   There will be a Party Room ballot for both the leadership and deputy leadership positions later this evening.   I will be a candidate and I expect to win.  Obviously  I am dismayed by the destabilisation that's been taking place now for many  many months and I do say to my fellow Liberals that the destabilisation just has to stop.  Let me finish on this note – I firmly believe that our Party is better than this  that our Government is better than this and  by God  that our country is so much better than this.,HER,status

The Australian Government deeply regrets the executions of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran.   The Government had hoped that Indonesia would show mercy to these young men  who have worked hard since their arrests to rehabilitate themselves and improve the lives of other prisoners.   They committed a serious crime.   Lengthy prison terms would have been an appropriate punishment.   In jail  Andrew Chan brought comfort and hope to others and Myuran Sukumaran shared his skills to give prisoners the chance of a better life.   Our thoughts and prayers are with Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran’s family and friends at this extremely difficult time.   Australia respects Indonesia’s sovereignty  but deeply regrets that Indonesia could not extend the mercy it so often seeks for its own citizens.   We will withdraw our Ambassador for consultations once the men’s bodies have been returned to the Chan and Sukumaran families.     Ministerial visits will remain suspended.,HER,status

We are at the eleventh hour  but even at this late stage  we are maximising our representations to the Indonesian Government.   What we are asking of Indonesia is what Indonesia asks of other countries when its citizens are on death row  and if it’s right for Indonesia to ask and expect some kind of clemency  it’s surely right for us to ask and expect some kind of clemency.  Yes  these two young Australians have done a very bad thing. They deserve jail time – they don’t deserve to die.,HER,status
The Liberal Party has dealt with the spill motion and now this matter is behind us.   We are absolutely determined to work for you  the people  who elected us.   We want to end the disunity and the uncertainty which destroyed two Labor governments  and give you the good government that you deserve.   We think that when you elect a government  when you elect a prime minister  you deserve to keep that government and that prime minister until you have a chance to change your mind.   So  the focus now is once more on jobs  families  a stronger economy and a secure nation.   We do face many challenges.   At heart  we are a highly successful country  justifiably proud of what we've achieved.   In essence  we are a strong economy with so much creativity and dynamism  and the challenge for government is to work with you  not against you.   I love this country  and I will do my best to help our country to succeed.,HER,status
As you know  two of my colleagues have called for a leadership spill of the two senior positions in our Party. They’ve called for a spill of my position as leader and they’ve called for a spill of Julie Bishop’s position as Deputy.   The first point to make is that they are perfectly entitled to call for this  but the next point to make is that they are asking the Party Room to vote out the people that the electorate voted in in September 2013.   I want to make this very simple point: we are not the Labor Party. We are not the Labor Party and we are not going to repeat the chaos and the instability of the Labor years.   So  I have spoken to Deputy Leader Julie Bishop and we will stand together in urging the Party Room to defeat this particular motion  and in so doing  and in defeating this motion to vote in favour of the stability and the team that the people voted for at the election.   We have a strong plan. It’s the strong plan that I enunciated at the Press Club this week and we are determined to get on with it – and we will.,HER,status

It is impossible to put into words the mixture of grief and fury that must be felt by people in Pakistan  and indeed around the world  at this latest terrorist atrocity in Peshawar.

It's a very sad day.  All of Australia is with the victims and families of the deceased.,HER,photo
Australians awoke to the news this morning that the siege in Martin Place has ended.  Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the two deceased hostages  the wounded and the other hostages.  I commend the courage and professionalism of the New South Wales Police and other emergency services involved.   Early this morning I was briefed on developments by New South Wales Premier Mike Baird and New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione  as well as Australian Federal Police Commissioner Andrew Colvin.  Commonwealth agencies will continue to provide every support to New South Wales authorities.  The National Security Committee of Cabinet will meet shortly to review the situation.,HER,status
I just want to make a short statement on the hostage incident in Martin Place in Sydney.   New South Wales Police are responding. They are being strongly supported by Commonwealth agencies.   We don't yet know the motivation of the perpetrator.   We don't know whether this is politically motivated  although  obviously there are some indications that it could be.   We have to appreciate that – even in a society such as ours – there are people who would wish to do us harm. That's why we have police and security organisations of the utmost professionalism that are ready and able to respond to a whole range of situations and contingencies  including the situation that we are now seeing in Sydney.   The whole point of politically motivated violence is to scare people out of being themselves.   Australia is a peaceful  open  and generous society. Nothing should ever change that  and that's why I would urge all Australians today to go about their business as usual.   Of course  if anyone does have any suspicions of untoward activity  there is the National Security Hotline – 1800 123 400 – which I would urge them to call.   I can let you know that the National Security Committee of the Cabinet has been briefed on this incident.   I have been in regular contact with Premier Baird over the course of the last couple of hours. I have been briefed by Commissioner Scipione of the New South Wales Police and by Commissioner Colvin of the Australian Federal Police.   This is an unfolding situation and as the situation unfolds there will be operational updates provided by the New South Wales Police.   I want to assure people that the ordinary business of government must go on  and it will go on  and that's why Treasurer Hockey and Finance Minister Cormann will shortly be releasing the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook as planned.   Finally  this is a very disturbing incident.   I can understand the concerns and anxieties of the Australian people at a time like this  but our thoughts and prayers must above all go out to the individuals who are caught up in this.   I can think of almost nothing more distressing  more terrifying  than to be caught up in such a situation  and our hearts go out to these people.,HER,status

Joan Kirner was much loved and she will be sorely missed.  As we mourn her loss  we remember a life well lived and passionately committed to social justice. We remember Joan for her commitment to education.   For becoming the first woman to lead the State of Victoria.  For her love of family and community.   After her time as Premier  Joan could have chosen a quieter and easier life.  But that simply would not have been Joan. Instead  her generosity of spirit and capacity for hard work meant her formidable energy went in to ensuring more Labor women entered parliament.  Labor’s affirmative action rule and the creation of Emily List would not have been possible without Joan.   For a generation of Labor women  including me  she was an inspiration and a mentor.  We admired her stoicism.  We celebrated her policy achievements.  We were guided by her wisdom.  For me  the relationship went beyond one of student and mentor.  Joan was the truest of friends.  She was one of the dominant influences on my life.  I basked in her warmth and treasured her support.  My deepest condolences go to the wonderful Kirner family.  I am heartened to know that Joan died surrounded by those she loved so much.  I will be forever grateful that I had the opportunity to see Joan on Friday and to say what needs to be said between friends when time comes to say goodbye.  I had the opportunity to witness the care and commitment of her medical team  particularly the nursing staff  and thank them for their professionalism and compassion.,HER,status

I honour Malcolm Fraser's service to our country as Prime Minister.   Malcolm Fraser in and beyond politics was a leader in the fight for racial equality. His brave stance against the evil of South Africa's apartheid helped change the world for the better.   Malcolm will always be remembered kindly for his commitment to multiculturalism and his specific actions to resettle Vietnamese boat people in Australia. Many will also recall with admiration his compassionate work internationally through his leadership post politics of CARE Australia and then CARE International.   My condolences go to his family  friends and colleagues  especially his wife Tamie  who has touched the hearts of so many Australians. After such a long and loving marriage  her grief will be profound and all our thoughts are with her.   With the loss of the great Gough Whitlam last year  the chapter in our nation's history that included the controversy of the dismissal has closed. However  our memories of that era encompass far more than the days of the constitutional crisis and today we remember all of Malcolm Fraser's life and works with respect. JG,HER,status

Earlier this month my work with The Brookings Institution and the Global Partnership for Education took me to Kigali  Rwanda where I attended several high level meetings focused on improving education in the region. I also had the opportunity to visit local schools  where I met with students  teachers  administrators and government officials to learn first hand about Rwanda’s great progress in providing near universal access to primary education.  On a visit to Save the Children's Right to Read programme at a school in Gicumbi  I was delighted to see the impact their Literacy Boost teacher training and book provision is having on children’s reading skills. And in all my meetings with members of the Government  teachers and administrators  I was deeply impressed with the great efforts that have been made to expand access and deliver a continuously improving education system.  But throughout my stay  I was also confronted by the challenges that remain in delivering a quality education. In Australia we no longer have to worry about access to drinking water in schools or the availability of quality education materials  but these are real issues in Rwanda. Both our nations share the need to find ways to successfully teach in English when it is a second or third language for children  but in Rwanda that challenge presents in teaching every child and many teachers are also struggling with the language of instruction.   While access to primary education is important  and there has been much progress to celebrate globally  it is simply not enough. As an international community we must focus on delivering a quality education to all children  including the most marginalised.   When world leaders meet in New York later this year to determine the Sustainable Development Goals  it is imperative that they agree to lift the global ambition on quality  equity and access to ensure that no child gets left behind. Of course  this will come at a cost. A higher global ambition must come hand in hand with a higher level of global financing for education systems in developing countries like Rwanda.  This is the focus of my work today and I’m so pleased to share it with you all - JG,HER,photo

It is with utter shock and dismay that I learned about the suicide bombing attack on a school in Potiskum in the northern Nigerian state of Yobe that reportedly killed more than 40 students and injured many more. This violence against children  who were simply pursuing their human right to be educated is appalling and heartbreaking  and the perpetrators have to be brought to justice.  Such atrocities against both students and teachers have occurred far too frequently in Nigeria. According to the Watchlist on Children and Armed Conflict  almost 100 students  teachers and civilians have been killed in at least six attacks on schools since July 1  2014.  It is the right of every child to get a free education  and it is the world’s obligation to ensure that schools are safe places – for students and teachers.  The Global Partnership for Education works with the Global Coalition to Protect Education from Attack (GCPEA)  to support efforts around the world that prevent violent attacks on education and improve protection.  As highlighted in previous statements by the GPE Board of Directors on the fatal attacks on a college in Nigeria on February 27  2014  and on the abduction of Nigerian school girls in May 2014  the Global Partnership for Education is supporting programs and policies to protect education from violence  including prevention and response.  The Global Partnership is also advocating adherence to existing international law protecting education and the strengthening of international norms and standards.  Our thoughts are with the families of the innocent children who have been killed. The global community must unite to end violence against schools everywhere and protect every child’s right to an education.,HER,status

I ran for president with the message that the government needs to once again work for the people  not the people work for the government. And while running for president I tried to reinforce what I have always believed - that speaking your mind matters  that experience matters  that competence matters and that it will always matter in leading our nation. That message was heard by and stood for by a lot of people  but just not enough and that’s ok. I have both won elections that I was supposed to lose and I’ve lost elections I was supposed to win and what that means is you never know what will happen.  That is both the magic and the mystery of politics - you never quite know when which is going to happen  even when you think you do. And so today  I leave the race without an ounce of regret.  I’m so proud of the campaign we ran  the people that ran it with me and all those who gave us their support and confidence along the way.

On Thursday I spoke in the Queen’s Speech debate about One Nation and inequality. Here is the full speech:,HER,video
I believe it isn’t simply leaders who achieve change  it is people that make change happen.,HER,video
In a couple of hours  I will no longer be leading this party. But for me that has never been the only way to achieve change. I believe it isn’t simply leaders who achieve change  it is people that make change happen. I will never give up on fighting for the Britain I believe in. I will always be there in that cause with all of you.  https://instagram.com/p/2a_8J-sI1O/,HER,link
I’ve just thanked Labour’s staff. They are a credit to our party  and  driven by a passion to serve  they are a credit to our country. Defeats are hard  but we’re a party that will never stop fighting for the working people of this country.,HER,photo
This has clearly been a very disappointing and difficult night for the Labour party. To every member and supporter  I want to say thank you.   The next government has a huge responsibility to bring our country together. What unites us is much  much more than what divides us.,HER,status
Polls are closed. We won't know the result for a while  but I want to say thank you to everyone who knocked on doors & everyone who voted.,HER,photo
We have a few hours left to change the direction of our country. Thank you to every supporter out there making the case for Labour today.,HER,photo
Here’s just a handful of things a Labour government will do to make Britain better.,HER,photo
Let’s not just reject the Conservatives today  let’s end the Tories' plan that always puts the rich and powerful first. #VoteLabour,HER,photo
I’ve just voted in Doncaster. Today isn’t a day to vote simply for Labour but to vote for yourself & for your family.   I’m grateful for the support of so many people  and for the work of so many Labour supporters. Today is the day we can change Britain. #VoteLabour,HER,photo
Today we have the chance to build a country that works for working people  not just a privileged few  to build a future for our young people  and to rescue our NHS.  The choice is not simply of policies or whether David Cameron or I is Prime Minister  it is a clash of two completely different ideas.  David Cameron believes that if the people on top do well  wealth will trickle down and all of Britain will prosper. I believe that Britain succeeds when working people succeed. If I am elected as Prime Minister  I will make every decision with that idea in mind.  This election is going to be the closest we have ever seen -- it is going to go down to the wire -- and your vote today will make a difference.  Here's to a bright future for our great country.,HER,status
To all Labour members and supporters: thank you. I am so proud to have fought this campaign alongside you. If our country votes for a Labour government tomorrow  it will be because of the dedication  passion and generosity of hundreds of thousands of people like you.    This truly grassroots-powered campaign has been unlike anything I’ve experienced in politics before. Meeting so many of you — and seeing firsthand your enthusiasm and energy for our vision of a better  fairer  more equal Britain — has been the biggest joy for me of the last six weeks.   So whatever the outcome tomorrow  I want now to celebrate and recognise the historic things we’ve already achieved together: the most conversations ever had with voters  the most small donors to an election campaign  the most volunteers.   I know that the vision we have spread across Britain — friend by friend  house by house  street by street — is one that can deliver real change for our country. It is a vision that can make lives better for millions of people  now and for generations to come.    So as you cast your vote tomorrow  remember who we are fighting this election for: the millions who work so hard every single day but still can’t make ends meet; the hundreds of thousands suffering under the weight of a Bedroom Tax they cannot escape; the young people who fear life will be worse for them than it was for their parents.   We are fighting this election for all of us. And for the part you’ve played — and will play tomorrow — I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart.   Here’s to you  and to a brighter future for our great country.,HER,status
The NHS as we know it can’t survive five more years of the Tories. I’ll make sure the NHS gets the protection and investment it deserves - with 20 000 more nurses  8 000 more GPs  5 000 more home-care workers and 3 00 more midwives.  Want to see that investment? Share →,HER,photo
I'm not asking you to vote simply for Labour tomorrow. I'm asking you to vote for yourself and your family.,HER,video
We’ll put Labour values back at the heart of the NHS  protect it for the future and create a health service that has time to care once again:  → 3 000 more midwives → 5 000 more careworkers → 8 000 more doctors → 20 000 more nurses → GP appointments guaranteed within 48 hours. → Cancer tests within one week.  Vote Labour tomorrow and we can make it happen  together.,HER,photo
In two days time it will be election day and in three days time we could have a Labour government. Thank you to everyone who’s playing their part,HER,photo
It’s great to have Steve Coogan backing Labour in this election - watch his video explaining why →,HER,video
Five years ago Nick Clegg promised to scrap tuition fees but he then trebled them. I’ve said I will cut tuition fees. If I fail to do it  I won’t stand for the office of Prime Minister in five years. There should be consequences when people’s trust is let down. With me as your Prime Minister  tuition fees will be cut. You have my word.,HER,photo
On day one of a Labour Government  we will free families from the burden of the Bedroom Tax. It’s indefensible and it’s cruel. It has punished those most in need in our society  causing untold misery for half a million families across the UK  two thirds of which include a disabled person. It’s a tax that affects 200 000 children and 60 000 carers - people we should be helping  not hurting. And under the Tories  a million more people could be hit by the tax in the next five years. This is a Government that cuts taxes for millionaires  opposes the mansion tax. It won’t abolish non-dom status but will keep the Bedroom Tax. I think that tells you everything you need to know about a Tory Government - and it tells you everything you need to know about a Labour Government that the first thing we’ll do is scrap it. We will legislate straight away to abolish the Bedroom Tax - in England  in Wales  in Scotland  right across our United Kingdom. We’ll get to work immediately to ensure that families no longer lose out. We’ll make new funds available to local authorities to offset the full costs of the tax for all families who currently pay it.,HER,photo
The Tories' secret plan to cut child benefit & tax credits has been revealed. Working families can't afford five years of the Tories.,HER,photo
If you missed it last night  here's our latest election broadcast:,HER,video
Those dying in the Mediterranean are some of the poorest men  women and children in the world. European leaders must work together to stop more of these drownings taking place.,HER,status
I just made a public challenge to David Cameron — live on TV — to defend his record in government before this election and face me in a head-to-head debate.  It seems obvious to me: if you are applying for the job of Prime Minister  the very least you can do is turn up for the job interview.   This Prime Minister owes it to Britain to stand up and debate me head-to-head on the urgent issues facing our country.  Either David Cameron or I will be Prime Minister in 22 days' time  and the time is over for cowardly no-shows.  I'm under no illusions: the only way Cameron is going to agree to this is if he believes it's more damaging for him to keep ducking this debate than to have to face up to his record in front of the public. That's why I need your help.  Back my call for a Prime Minister's debate: www.labour.org.uk/w/debate  He refused to turn up tonight to defend his disastrous NHS record  or his decision to give tax cuts to the wealthiest while everyone else pays more — or the fact that working people are worse off now than when he took office.  Labour has a better plan for Britain  one that puts working people at its heart: and I welcome David Cameron to challenge me on it  one-on-one.,HER,status
Today  the Tories have launched some pretty personal attacks  led off by the Defence Secretary Michael Fallon. I actually think he is a decent man but today he demeaned himself and he demeaned his office. National security is too important to play politics with. I will never compromise our national security. I will never negotiate away our national security. The Conservative Party can throw what they like at me but I’m going to carry on concentrating on the issues that matter to the British people: how we keep our country safe  how we invest in education  how we tackle tax avoidance  how we make this country work for working people. I think the British people deserve better than a Conservative campaign based on deceit and lies. To coin a phrase  I think Britain can do a lot better than this.,HER,status
I want to say  Nigel Farage's comment about the NHS and HIV was disgusting. He should be ashamed. The fact he isn't says so much.,HER,status
If you’re a fan of Martin Freeman  I think you’ll like this video he's made on the choice on offer at this election→,HER,video
Martin Freeman has made an election video for us. He talks about "community  compassion & decency”  the values leading him to vote Labour on 7 May. Watch the video  share it with your friends  and help us elect a Labour government in May that will stand up for everybody  not just a privileged few.,HER,video

I’m supporting Ed Miliband’s campaign to be Labour leader for two  reasons. The first and foremost reason is his vision for the Labour  Party. Ed has outlined his desire for a strong  campaigning grassroots  movement that is fully participatory. Those who became disillusioned  with Labour were aggrieved because they felt ignored  that the  leadership was not listening. Winning back this support is a crucial  step in forming a forceful and effective opposition to the coalition  government. Secondly  Ed’s vision for the country. I believe that Ed has  the best policy ideas and importantly the judgement  illustrated by his  tenure as Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change.  Furthermore  his way of communicating is inspiring  direct and  consensual  not combative – I took my friend to see Ed speak in Leeds  last week and she joined the Labour Party straight afterwards and will  vote for him in the leadership election.

The murder of Lee Rigby was an event that outraged and sickened Londoners  and the memories of that tragedy are still raw. I find it absolutely incredible that Sadiq Khan  a candidate for the office of Mayor of London  could hire as his speechwriter someone who has suggested that event was in any way fabricated.  To my mind that shows an appalling lack of judgement  and I do not see how Mr Khan could command the confidence - or the support - of Londoners.,HER,video
I am a European. I lived many years in Brussels. I rather love the old place. And so I resent the way we continually confuse Europe – the home of the greatest and richest culture in the world  to which Britain is and will be an eternal contributor – with the political project of the European Union. It is  therefore  vital to stress that there is nothing necessarily anti-European or xenophobic in wanting to vote Leave on June 23.     And it is important to remember: it isn’t we in this country who have changed. It is the European Union. In the 28 years since I first started writing for this paper about the Common Market – as it was then still known – the project has morphed and grown in such a way as to be unrecognisable  rather as the vast new Euro palaces of glass and steel now lour over the little cobbled streets in the heart of the Belgian capital.   When I went to Brussels in 1989  I found well-meaning officials (many of them British) trying to break down barriers to trade with a new procedure – agreed by Margaret Thatcher – called Qualified Majority Voting. The efforts at harmonisation were occasionally comical  and I informed readers about euro-condoms and the great war against the British prawn cocktail flavour crisp. And then came German reunification  and the panicked efforts of Delors  Kohl and Mitterrand to “lock” Germany into Europe with the euro; and since then the pace of integration has never really slackened.   As new countries have joined  we have seen a hurried expansion in the areas for Qualified Majority Voting  so that Britain can be overruled more and more often (as has happened in the past five years). We have had not just the Maastricht Treaty  but Amsterdam  Nice  Lisbon  every one of them representing an extension of EU authority and a centralisation in Brussels. According to the House of Commons library  anything between 15 and 50 per cent of UK legislation now comes from the EU; and remember that this type of legislation is very special.   It is unstoppable  and it is irreversible – since it can only be repealed by the EU itself. Ask how much EU legislation the Commission has actually taken back under its various programmes for streamlining bureaucracy. The answer is none. That is why EU law is likened to a ratchet  clicking only forwards. We are seeing a slow and invisible process of legal colonisation  as the EU infiltrates just about every area of public policy. Then – and this is the key point – the EU acquires supremacy in any field that it touches; because it is one of the planks of Britain’s membership  agreed in 1972  that any question involving the EU must go to Luxembourg  to be adjudicated by the European Court of Justice.   It was one thing when that court contented itself with the single market  and ensuring that there was free and fair trade across the EU. We are now way beyond that stage. Under the Lisbon Treaty  the court has taken on the ability to vindicate people’s rights under the 55-clause “Charter of Fundamental Human Rights”  including such peculiar entitlements as the right to found a school  or the right to “pursue a freely chosen occupation” anywhere in the EU  or the right to start a business.   These are not fundamental rights as we normally understand them  and the mind boggles as to how they will be enforced. Tony Blair told us he had an opt-out from this charter.   Alas  that opt-out has not proved legally durable  and there are real fears among British jurists about the activism of the court. The more the EU does  the less room there is for national decision-making. Sometimes these EU rules sound simply ludicrous  like the rule that you can’t recycle a teabag  or that children under eight cannot blow up balloons  or the limits on the power of vacuum cleaners. Sometimes they can be truly infuriating – like the time I discovered  in 2013  that there was nothing we could do to bring in better-designed cab windows for trucks  to stop cyclists being crushed. It had to be done at a European level  and the French were opposed.   Sometimes the public can see all too plainly the impotence of their own elected politicians – as with immigration. That enrages them; not so much the numbers as the lack of control. That is what we mean by loss of sovereignty – the inability of people to kick out  at elections  the men and women who control their lives. We are seeing an alienation of the people from the power they should hold  and I am sure this is contributing to the sense of disengagement  the apathy  the view that politicians are “all the same” and can change nothing  and to the rise of extremist parties.   Democracy matters; and I find it deeply worrying that the Greeks are effectively being told what to do with their budgets and public spending  in spite of huge suffering among the population. And now the EU wants to go further. There is a document floating around Brussels called “The Five Presidents Report”  in which the leaders of the various EU institutions map out ways to save the euro. It all involves more integration: a social union  a political union  a budgetary union. At a time when Brussels should be devolving power  it is hauling more and more towards the centre  and there is no way that Britain can be unaffected.   David Cameron has done his very best  and he has achieved more than many expected. There is some useful language about stopping “ever-closer union” from applying to the UK  about protecting the euro outs from the euro ins  and about competition and deregulation.   There is an excellent forthcoming Bill that will assert the sovereignty of Parliament  the fruit of heroic intellectual labour by Oliver Letwin  which may well exercise a chilling effect on some of the more federalist flights of fancy of the court and the Commission. It is good  and right  but it cannot stop the machine; at best it can put a temporary and occasional spoke in the ratchet.   There is only one way to get the change we need  and that is to vote to go  because all EU history shows that they only really listen to a population when it says No. The fundamental problem remains: that they have an ideal that we do not share. They want to create a truly federal union  e pluribus unum  when most British people do not.   It is time to seek a new relationship  in which we manage to extricate ourselves from most of the supranational elements. We will hear a lot in the coming weeks about the risks of this option; the risk to the economy  the risk to the City of London  and so on; and though those risks cannot be entirely dismissed  I think they are likely to be exaggerated. We have heard this kind of thing before  about the decision to opt out of the euro  and the very opposite turned out to be the case.   I also accept there is a risk that a vote to Leave the EU  as it currently stands  will cause fresh tensions in the union between England and Scotland. On the other hand  most of the evidence I have seen suggests that the Scots will vote on roughly the same lines as the English.   We will be told that a Brexit would embolden Putin  though it seems to me he is more likely to be emboldened  for instance  by the West’s relative passivity in Syria.   Above all  we will be told that whatever the democratic deficiencies  we would be better off remaining in because of the “influence” we have. This is less and less persuasive to me. Only 4 per cent of people running the Commission are UK nationals  when Britain contains 12 per cent of the EU population. It is not clear why the Commission should be best placed to know the needs of UK business and industry  rather than the myriad officials at UK Trade & Investment or the Department for Business  Innovation and Skills.   If the “Leave” side wins  it will indeed be necessary to negotiate a large number of trade deals at great speed. But why should that be impossible? We have become so used to Nanny in Brussels that we have become infantilised  incapable of imagining an independent future. We used to run the biggest empire the world has ever seen  and with a much smaller domestic population and a relatively tiny Civil Service. Are we really unable to do trade deals? We will have at least two years in which the existing treaties will be in force.   The real risk is to the general morale of Europe  and to the prestige of the EU project. We should take that seriously.   We should remember that this federalist vision is not an ignoble idea. It was born of the highest motives – to keep the peace in Europe. The people who run the various EU institutions – whom we like to ply with crass abuse – are  in my experience  principled and thoughtful officials. They have done some very good things: I think of the work of Sir Leon Brittan  for instance  as Competition Commissioner  and his fight against state aid.   They just have a different view of the way Europe should be constructed. I would hope they would see a vote to leave as a challenge  not just to strike a new and harmonious relationship with Britain (in which those benefits could be retained) but to recover some of the competitiveness that the continent has lost in the last decades.   Whatever happens  Britain needs to be supportive of its friends and allies – but on the lines originally proposed by Winston Churchill: interested  associated  but not absorbed; with Europe – but not comprised. We have spent 500 years trying to stop continental European powers uniting against us. There is no reason (if everyone is sensible) why that should happen now  and every reason for friendliness.   For many Conservatives  this has already been a pretty agonising business. Many of us are deeply internally divided  and we are divided between us. We know that we do not agree on the substance  but I hope we can all agree to concentrate on the arguments; to play the ball and not the man.   At the end of it all  we want to get a result  and then get on and unite around David Cameron – continuing to deliver better jobs  better housing  better health  education and a better quality of life for our constituents for whom (let’s be frank) the EU is not always the number one issue.   It is entirely thanks to the Prime Minister  his bravery and energy  and the fact that he won a majority Conservative government  that we are having a referendum at all. Never forget that if it were down to Jeremy Corbyn and the so-called People’s Party  the people would be completely frozen out.   This is the right moment to have a referendum  because as Europe changes  Britain is changing too. This is a truly great country that is now going places at extraordinary speed. We are the European  if not the world  leaders in so many sectors of the 21st-century economy; not just financial services  but business services  the media  biosciences  universities  the arts  technology of all kinds (of the 40 EU technology companies worth more than $1 billion  17 are British); and we still have a dizzyingly fertile manufacturing sector.   Now is the time to spearhead the success of those products and services not just in Europe  but in growth markets beyond. This is a moment to be brave  to reach out – not to hug the skirts of Nurse in Brussels  and refer all decisions to someone else.   We have given so much to the world  in ideas and culture  but the most valuable British export and the one for which we are most famous is the one that is now increasingly in question: parliamentary democracy – the way the people express their power.   This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to vote for real change in Britain’s relations with Europe. This is the only opportunity we will ever have to show that we care about self-rule. A vote to Remain will be taken in Brussels as a green light for more federalism  and for the erosion of democracy.   In the next few weeks  the views of people like me will matter less and less  because the choice belongs to those who are really sovereign – the people of the UK. And in the matter of their own sovereignty the people  by definition  will get it right.,HER,link
I was going into the Tory conference last week and a chap shouted at the top of his voice  “Boris Johnson  you are SCUM!” At which there was a chorus of assent  and various projectiles were hurled in my general direction. Scum  eh  I thought to myself.   There is no way of dressing that up as a compliment. Scum is the stuff that floats on top of some stagnant and foul-smelling mere. It is the loathsome by-product of an unappetising biological or chemical process. If you tell someone that they are scum  you are saying that they are less than human: something to be abominated and hygienically removed.   As I looked out later at the jeering crowd  I tried to work out what was winding them up. I studied the placards. Some of them were against fracking. Some were worried about nuclear weapons; some seemed to think that the country was in the grip of a paedophile conspiracy. Many of them seemed to have strong feelings about pigs – though whether pro or anti it was hard to say. They seemed  to put it mildly  to be confused about their overall message and point of view  but of their strength of feeling there could be no doubt.   So I brooded on that subtle and deceptive human emotion  the feeling that crowd was so clearly articulating by its choice of language. I fell to pondering the nature of hatred. I wondered what was causing them to throw eggs and spit at blameless white-haired Tory councillors  men and women who have given much of their lives to public service  and who often devote themselves tirelessly and without pay to all manner of charities and good causes. What made this rage and spite?   It is an odd thing to feel hated  especially if you are not quite sure why. I expect there are many readers who know the feeling – someone who inexplicably spreads awful rumours about you; someone who looks at you with unconcealed malevolence.   I once got a letter through my door saying  “I just want you to know how sickened I am to live in the same neighbourhood as you”  and I thought  “Duh: what have I done?” So I offer this article by way of reassurance to all you who have ever had the nasty feeling that someone somewhere has got it in for you. If you think someone hates you (and you genuinely think it’s unfair)  then remember the golden rule of hatred. It’s not about you. It’s about them.   Let me explain. One of the most extraordinary features of human psychology is our use of transference  or projection – in other words  managing our emotions with the help of symbols or fetishes or proxies.   Most MPs will be familiar with constituents who come to see them with some problem that seems to have become an obsession: a tree that was unfairly chopped down  a neighbour’s fence that takes too much land  or some other injustice. Often they will have folders or plastic bags stuffed full of letters. You  of course  try your best to help them  but as things drag on  you notice that they are really more interested in the process  the campaign  than the solution.   In fact  you soon realise that the issue that they have placed before you is really of much less importance than some other big problem in their lives – a bereavement  a divorce  or some other deep disappointment – and that feeling of anger and injustice is channelled and focused on this tree  or stretch of pavement  or whatever. Sometimes  in fact  you find that they don’t really want the problem to be “solved”. The hate-object has become a necessary psychological crutch  a part of their lives – the thing that helps divert them from the real and insoluble problem. And what is true of individuals is true of societies  too.   When a community is going through some period of stress – a war  or economic hardship – they are historically far more likely to identify and turn on scapegoats in their midst. Anxiety is transferred to some readily identifiable group: Jews  foreigners  homosexuals  gypsies – the victims of this kind of prejudice have in some cases been suffering for centuries. Sometimes  barely credible powers are attributed to these groups  and they become a catch-all explanation for everything that has gone wrong in a society. Your kids can’t get a house? It’s the immigrants. Can’t get a job? It’s the immigrants. Can’t see a doctor in A&E? It’s the immigrants. Traffic on the M4? It’s the immigrants.   Of course  these problems have multiple causes – but people are only too willing to project their anger on to a particular group  and some politicians  alas  are only too willing to assist. Take Leon Brittan  a fine public servant whose memory has been disgracefully smeared by Tom Watson. How did the Labour MP get away with it? Because he knew paedophiles are the lowest in the hierarchy of contempt.   The paedophile’s great gift to the human race is to confer a sense of moral superiority on absolutely everyone else – including the murderers and rapists who beat up the “nonces” in prison. That’s how hatred works. The murderers and rapists don’t really hate the paedophiles  or care for their victims; they just want to feel better about themselves. It’s all about projection.   Who are those crusty demonstrators really cross with? Well  look at the real cause of their woes and their impotence. They are partly furious with the British public for returning a majority Conservative government – but they can’t possibly say that. And they are partly furious with the Labour Party  first under Ed Miliband and now under Jeremy Corbyn  for being so spectacularly useless in helping to advance their cause – and they can’t possibly admit that  either. Their real anger and grief is internal  about the collapse of Labour as a coherent opposition. But that is too big and too difficult an issue to address honestly. So they throw eggs and shout about scum.   Well  my fellow scumsters  just remember  in the unlikely event that you mind these insults: it’s not about you  it’s about them.  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/11925511/Labour-directs-its-impotent-fury-at-all-but-those-responsible-itself.html,HER,link
Well  folks  the joke’s over. They really have elected him: a man who rebelled against the Labour Party 533 times  who cosies up to just about every terrorist group in the world  who wants this country to leave Nato and who once campaigned for school playing fields to be handed over to gypsies. It is surreal  incredible – and yet Jeremy Corbyn is now in charge of Her Majesty’s Official Opposition  and we must take him seriously.   So here is something reassuring that Jez could do on day one of his leadership to show he is genuinely on the side of working people. If he wants to begin the arduous climb towards electoral credibility he should announce his party’s support  today  for the Trade Union Bill.   It is a reform I passionately believe in  not least since I proposed the essence of it more than five years ago. We needed it for London then  and we need it today  because we are in the throes of the biggest modernisation in modern memory. You may well have forgotten – such is the ability of Mother Nature to efface the memory of pain – that there was a time when the performance of London Underground was not held in high regard.   I seem to remember a mordant song  to the tune of Going Underground by The Jam  that complained of the smell  the crowding  the tramps  the chewing gum on the seats  the damp – and above all  the delays. Well  I thought it was unfair then – and you don’t hear people singing that song today. Since 2008 there have been massive reductions in delays. We achieved a 40 per cent cut in Tube delays in the period to 2012  and are well on target to achieving a further 30 per cent cut.   We have more trains  better signalling – and the trains run faster than ever before. We are blasting on with a fantastic programme of improvement – air-conditioned carriages first on the subsurface lines  and then on the deep ones. We are extending the Tube for the first time in 15 years  with the link out to Battersea  to say nothing of Crossrail  and we are moving towards ever greater automation.   London Underground will never again buy an old-fashioned train with a cab that requires a driver to sit there the whole time: the new Piccadilly Line trains will allow staff to move down the carriages  as they do on the Docklands Light Railway. Transport for London is leading the world in automated ticketing – and we are now the biggest contactless payment retailer in the world  as more and more people switch to paying by bank card. It goes without saying that we are carrying more people than ever before – about a quarter more passengers every day than eight years ago.   All these changes have been delivered by the staff of the Tube. They have done a superb job. Most of the workforce has understood that the technological changes are great for the travelling public and that they are right for the Tube: there is no point having staff sitting behind plate glass in booths when ticketing is done electronically.   Almost everyone understands that changes in technology must mean changes in working practices. Many new jobs are created  but some are done differently  and some not at all. The trouble is that there has been a small minority of union activists and leaders  who have abused their position and tried to hold the city to ransom  by resisting every change and by using modernisation as an excuse for industrial action.   We have had strikes that have achieved absolutely nothing – except to inconvenience Londoners  to damage the economy  and to cost many hard-working Tube staff their pay during the period of the strikes. To make matters worse  these strikes have very often been triggered by the stubbornness of a tiny number of workers  so that we have sometimes had the Tube services severely disrupted after fewer than 20 per cent of the relevant workforce had voted for action. That is absolutely ridiculous  and so it is high time that the Government has brought forward some sensible measures to deal with these militant excesses.   The Bill before Parliament will do something to tackle picket-line intimidation; it will end the system whereby union contributions are simply sluiced out of the member’s bank account; it will attempt to tighten the rules that allow workers to be full‑time trade union representatives.   Above all  the Bill being proposed by Sajid Javid will bring in thresholds for the ballots for industrial action  so that you can no longer have a wildcat strike triggered by a tiny minority of workers. The key point is that when it comes to essential public services  the strike action must be supported by 40 per cent of the relevant workforce  and there must be at least a 50 per cent turnout.  That is not remotely draconian. Yes  of course we elect politicians on lower turnouts  and we have no thresholds in democratic elections; but we are talking here about services that are vital for the daily lives of millions of people. There are plenty of other cities that have some kind of restrictions on the right of mass transit workers to go on strike – and in New York  land of banned by law. If this Bill’s protection had been in place  it would have stopped 19 of the past 26 strikes on the Tube.   Of course  it will not stop trade unions from playing a constructive role in modernisation  or from withdrawing the labour of their members. But it will greatly help two sets of working people – the travelling public  and the majority of workers who have often rejected the strike  implicitly or explicitly  and who just want to get on with their jobs.   Now is the time for the great vested leader to take on the vested interests of the union barons – and do something for the workers.,HER,status
Look  I have to admit that I have written about this subject before  and I know from the splenetic feedback that there are plenty of people who don’t give a monkey’s. There are a fair few otherwise well-intentioned readers of the Telegraph who aren’t much moved by the fate of a few old ruins in Syria. They will have looked at the photos of Isil blowing up the temple of Baal Shamin  and turned instantly to the sport  or clicked on the item about Jeremy Corbyn’s “makeover” – or whatever.   I know that there are people who think it doesn’t much matter if terrorists blow up ancient temples – rather than live human beings; plenty of us who secretly think  well  they are already RUINS  aren’t they? Who really cares if they are blown to atoms?   Well  I care  and I would like to persuade you that it matters to you  to your life  and to your security. It is now almost exactly 2 000 years since the inhabitants of Palmyra completed that temple  and the reason it has survived is because every succeeding generation has marvelled at its harmony and elegance of conception.   It has survived every conqueror and every invasion in a region famed for the brutality of its invaders. No one has been so moronic and vile as to destroy an object that so adorned our collective civilisation – no one until Daesh  or Isil  or whatever we want to call them. People feel instinctively that these buildings stand for something remarkable – the willingness of one civilisation to learn from another  to adopt architectural styles  to blend  to merge – to enjoy and accept and build on the legacy of the past. This annihilated temple was consecrated to Baal – the god of the Phoenicians – but it was respected by Greeks  by Romans  by Jews  and by Arabs of all denominations.   It is Isil and Isil alone that has introduced this nauseating nihilism; and when I fantasise about my ideal solution for these people  I think of the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark  when the Nazi plunderers are physically vaporised before our eyes. I am sorry to sound vindictive  but that I think is what they deserve – and especially for their murder of the 82-year-old curator  Khalid al-Asaad.   Yeah  you may say  and who is going to avenge him? Who is going to play Yahweh? No one wants to take them on. Everyone is frit of Isil  you may say – and it seems that no one in any Western capital thinks Syria is worth the bones of a Pomeranian grenadier  as Bismarck put it  let alone of a British grenadier.   Well  I am not sure that this will do any more – not when we look at the tragedy unfurling in the Mediterranean  the hideous fate of the 71 Syrian refugees in that lorry in Austria  the awful scorching sufferings of the migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean.   A few years ago I went to Palmyra  and other places in Syria  and realised that it was a place of unbelievable cultural richness. We went to Aleppo and saw the ancient souk. We went to Apamea and saw the lustrous mosaics of hunting and wine-making and agriculture – reminding you that for centuries this place was the very heart of the Christian Roman empire.   I thought then that this country had a lush future. The food was delicious; the people were gentle and civilised and friendly. I imagined brochures for villas called Simply Syria; and trekking holidays and cycling holidays; perhaps even Club 18-30  in the racier parts of Damascus – shades of Beirut in the good old days. At the centre of it all was the magnetic pull of culture  and history  and the touristic notion that you could better yourself by exposure to one of the oldest civilisations in the world.   My optimism was founded entirely on my astonishment at the relics of the past – and if you think heritage is unimportant to tourism  look at the reasons people cite for coming to London  now the number one tourist destination on Earth. Yes  it’s the bars and the theatres and the nightlife – but when people are asked to explain the reasons  they always tick the box marked “history” or “heritage”. Syria has at least 6 000 years of it  and some of the world’s most famous and important sites. Until now.   The fate of all these relics is now either grim or uncertain  lost in the fog of war – as they are destroyed  like the souk of Aleppo; or sold by Isil to fund their operations. One day I hope and pray that this nightmare will end  that Isil will be defeated – and peace will return.   And then what? What future will there be for the country – with their economy in ruins  with the potential for tourism destroyed along with their cultural heritage? I perfectly accept that intervention has not often worked. It has been a disaster in Iraq; it has been a disaster in Libya. But can you honestly say that non-intervention in Syria has been a success? If we keep doing nothing about the nightmare in Syria  then frankly we must brace ourselves for an eternity of refugees  more people suffocating in airless cattle trucks at European motorway service stations  more people trying to climb the barbed wire that we are building around the European Union.   The number one political problem in Europe this summer is the movement of migrants  and there are many potential solutions. The Home Secretary has bravely proposed a fundamental reform to the EU – that we should disallow free movement of labour  unless the migrant worker has a clearly defined job to go to. I believe many people in this country would support such a reform  though the devil  as ever  would be in the detail. But we must also tackle the reasons why people flee their homes – and we cannot let Isil destroy sites that are not only emblems of our civilisation  but which offer hope for the Syrian economy.   If the Syrians are deprived of their past  they will have no future.,HER,status
I don’t suppose for a second that the Queen will read this article  any more than she reads any other item of the ephemeral media flim-flam. Indeed  I rather hope that she doesn’t – because there are far more important subjects. But perhaps there is some way that the gist could be conveyed to her by an equerry; perhaps it could be summarised along with the racing results  etc  and placed on a silver salver or something – not because the opinion is my own  but because in offering this loyal message to her Majesty  I bet I am joined by millions of Telegraph readers and many more angry millions across the country.  Our message concerns the recently published video footage of herself and her sister  mother and uncle  playing in the garden about 80 years ago. It is this. If you have a microsecond of embarrassment about this footage  Ma’am  then DON’T. If you feel the faintest twinge of regret about your childhood behaviour  then DON’T. If you are seized by the smallest spasm of irritation about the journalists who somehow got hold of a family home movie  then DON’T. Don’t bother. It’s not worth it. They are only doing what they are paid to do. It is entirely in the nature of the beast.  I hope that the Queen and her family will be fortified by the huge outpouring of love and support from the commonsensical mass of the British people  who can see this for exactly what it is: the innocent actions of a seven-year-old child and her four-year-old sister. It makes my blood boil to think that anyone should use this image in any way to impugn the extraordinary record of service of Her Majesty to this country. She was a child  a tiny child  and she is making that parodic salute long before her family could possibly have grasped what Hitler and Hitlerism was really all about. This was in 1933  just when Hitler had come to power; and to appreciate the triviality of this play-acting  you must remember that there were adults  grown-up men who continued to make colossal errors of judgment about Hitler right up until the outbreak of the Second World War.  You will recall that in 1936 Hitler broke international treaties and invaded the Rhineland; and for many people in this country it was becoming obvious that he was bent on revenge for the First World War  that he was virulently anti-Semitic  and that he could not be trusted. So here is your starter for 10. Who went to Germany after that invasion  and returned so bamboozled by Hitler that he called him  “a born leader of men  a magnetic dynamic personality with a single-minded purpose  a resolute will and a dauntless heart”? It was the man who led us to victory in the First World War; one of the founders of the welfare state; a man who is widely revered for his work for the poor and needy of Britain. It was former PM David Lloyd George  who went on in the same emetic article to call the German leader “the George Washington of Germany”.  And Lloyd George was not alone in his bad judgment. Which editor of a great and patriotic national newspaper was a supporter of appeasement – the policy of letting Hitler get away with it? Step forward Geoffrey Dawson  fellow of All Souls and editor of The Times. He published a leader after the remilitarisation of the Rhineland announcing that it was “A Chance to Rebuild”. He was so pro-German that in 1937 he said that he spent the evenings looking at the proofs of the paper  and “taking out anything which I think will hurt their susceptibilities and dropping in little things which are intended to soothe them”. Of course  Dawson was also innocent – in the sense that he couldn’t have imagined that Hitler’s concentration camps such as Dachau  which had first opened in 1933  would become a byword for horror; and indeed The Times changed its tune pretty smartly as soon as war broke out.  All I am trying to show is that delusions about Hitler persisted even among the most brilliant and well-educated adults  and even among those who were to become his most formidable opponents. So here is my final question. Shortly after Hitler entered the Sudetenland  a famous statesman made an extraordinary observation. “One may dislike Hitler’s system  yet admire his patriotic achievement ” said this British politician in November 1938. “If our country were defeated  I hope we should find a champion as indomitable to restore our courage and lead us back to our place among the nations”. Who said it? Well  you all know the answer – it was Winston Churchill  of course. Ah  you will say; but we have ripped Churchill’s words out of context; we have found one iffy remark that should in no way subtract from his clear and prescient warnings about the reality of the threat from Hitler and Nazism. And you are right. It is all about context  context  context.  The two little girls are plainly fooling around  and so is their mother  and so – probably – is their uncle Edward  even if he did go on to maintain a sinister sympathy for the Nazi regime. This was a time when people made fun of Nazis and their pompous and preposterous behaviour – think of P G Wodehouse’s character Spode  in the Code of the Woosters  expecting people to greet him with the words “Heil Spode”. People have made fun of Nazis ever since. Is there anyone growing up in post-war Britain who has not at one time or another done a mock-fascist Dr Strangelove salute? Is there anyone who cannot remember little kids at some stage flapping their arms in that way? And this is after the war  after the horror had been exposed. These days people pay a high price for jokes. Think of Sir Tim Hunt. But at least he was an adult who understood what he was saying. The young Queen-to-be had no idea of the contemporary – let alone the later – significance of her gesture  and today she fully deserves the national surge of affection and admiration.,HER,status
My thoughts today on behalf of all Londoners. #sevenseven,HER,photo
If we are going to defeat our enemies we have to know who they are. We have to know what to call them. We must at least settle on a name – a terminology – with which we can all agree. And the trouble with the fight against Islamic terror is that we are increasingly grappling with language  and with what it is permissible or sensible to say.  When a man sprays bullets at innocent tourists on a beach  or when a man decapitates his boss and sticks his head on the railings  or when a man blows himself up in a mosque in Kuwait – and when all three atrocities are instantly “claimed” by the same disgusting organisation – it is surely obvious that we are dealing with the same specific form of evil. This is terrorism.  But what are the objectives of this terrorism? Is it religious? Is it political? Is it a toxic mixture of the two? And what exactly is its relationship with Islam? Many thoughtful Muslims are now attempting – understandably – to decouple their religion from any association with violence of this kind.  The excellent Rehman Chishti  MP for Gillingham  has launched a campaign to change the way we all talk about “Isil”. He points out that the very use of the term “Islamic State” is in itself a capitulation to these sadistic and loathsome murderers. They are not running a state  and their gangster organisation is not Islamic – it is a narcissistic death cult.  Rehman’s point is that if you call it Islamic State you are playing their game; you are dignifying their criminal and barbaric behaviour; you are giving them a propaganda boost that they don’t deserve  especially in the eyes of some impressionable young Muslims. He wants us all to drop the terms  in favour of more derogatory names such as “Daesh” or “Faesh”  and his point deserves a wider hearing.  But then there are others who would go much further  and strip out any reference to the words “Muslim” or “Islam” in the discussion of this kind of terrorism – and here I am afraid I disagree. I can well understand why so many Muslims feel this way. Whatever we may think of the “truth” of any religion  there are billions of people for whom faith is a wonderful thing: a consolation  an inspiration – part of their identity.  There are hundreds of millions of Muslims for whom the word “Islamic” is a term of the highest praise. They resent the constant association of “Islam” with “terrorism”  as though the one was always fated to give birth to the other. They dislike even the concept of “Islamic extremism”  since it seems to imply a seamless continuum of Muslim belief and behaviour: from liberal to tolerant to conservative to reactionary to terrorist.  Their point is that terrorist violence is alien from Islam  and that is why they argue so strenuously that we should drop all references to “Muslim terrorists” or “Islamic terrorists”. They say that any use of the word Islam or Muslim in such a context is actually offensive and derogatory  and helps to alienate the very people we need to win over.  As one Muslim friend put it to me  “you wouldn’t talk about Christian terrorists would you?” And there is some truth in that. We don’t talk about “Christian terrorism” even in the context of the sectarian violence between Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland. Why do we seem to taint a whole religion by association with a violent minority?  Well  I am afraid there are two broad reasons why some such association is inevitable. The first is a simple point of language  and the need to use terms that everyone can readily grasp. It is very difficult to bleach out all reference to Islam or Muslim from discussion of this kind of terror  because we have to pinpoint what we are actually talking about. It turns out that there is virtually no word to describe an Islamically-inspired terrorist that is not in some way prejudicial  at least to Muslim ears.  You can’t say “salafist”  because there are many law-abiding and peaceful salafists. You can’t say jihadi  because jihad – the idea of struggle – is a central concept of Islam  and doesn’t necessarily involve violence; indeed  you can be engaged in a jihad against your own moral weakness. The only word that seems to carry general support among Muslim leaders is Kharijite – which means a heretic – and which is not  to put it mildly  a word in general use among the British public.  We can’t just call it “terrorism”  as some have suggested  because we need to distinguish it from any other type of terrorism – whether animal rights terrorists or Sendero Luminoso Marxists. We need to speak plainly  to call a spade a spade. We can’t censor the use of “Muslim” or “Islamic”.  That just lets too many people off the hook. If we deny any connection between terrorism and religion  then we are saying there is no problem in any of the mosques; that there is nothing in the religious texts that is capable of being twisted or misunderstood; that there are no religious leaders whipping up hatred of the west  no perverting of religious belief for political ends.  If we purge our vocabulary of any reference to the specifically religious associations of the problem  then we are not only ignoring the claims of the terrorists themselves (which might be reasonable)  but the giant fact that there is a struggle going on now for the future of Islam  and how it can adapt to the 21st century. The terrorism we are seeing across the Muslim world is partly a function of that struggle  and of the chronic failure of much Islamic thinking to distinguish between politics and religion.  The struggle is really about power  of course  rather than spirituality – but that does not mean we can ignore the potency of the religious dimension. It doesn’t much matter which word we agree on  with Muslim communities  to describe this ideology of terror – Islamism? Islamo-fascism? – but we need to settle on it fast  and then join together to stamp out the phenomenon. If we are going to beat them  we must all at least know their name.,HER,status
I sometimes think we are missing the main point of this Greek crisis. We talk of deadlines and deadlocks and dénouements. We go on about the personalities and politics involved – and yet they are all irrelevant next to what has emerged as the one gigantic conclusion from which only a cretin would seriously dissent. It would make no difference to this conclusion  now  if the Greek government were a load of neo-Marxists in motorbike leathers or a junta of Frankfurt bankers.  It doesn’t matter – for the purposes of this argument – whether the whole thing collapses tomorrow  or next month  or next year. They can “kick the can” even further down the road  or just watch as that battered object is finally steamrollered by the logic of the markets. They can keep the Greeks locked for ever in the procrustean torture of the euro or they can allow them suddenly to print billions of new drachmas on the back of cereal packets.  Whatever happens  nothing can change the fundamental truth: the Greeks should never have joined the euro.  They were mad to abandon the safety valve of an independent monetary policy  and they are paying for that folly in a daily and escalating human tragedy: of falling life expectancy  of rising suicides and mass unemployment; of medicines they can no longer afford  of operations cancelled and hope extinguished.  However it unfolds  the Greek catastrophe has exploded the central proposition of EU integration  the assertion that has been made time and again to the British people to secure their assent to new treaties – that the loss of national political control is always a price worth paying for overall economic gain.  That was the bargain  that was the trade-off – more or less explicit – when Britain signed up to the Common Market. We were told (though never very volubly) that there would be some loss of parliamentary “sovereignty”; and Mrs Thatcher again understood quite clearly that trade-off  when in 1986 she came to consider the advantages to Britain of the single market programme. She signed up  without much fanfare  to a very big increase in qualified majority voting. She gave up certain national prerogatives and independence  because like virtually every other UK prime minister  she persuaded herself that British citizens and businesses would benefit.  That is the Faustian pact of the EU. You surrender something precious in the form of national autonomy – and everyone is meant to be richer. Well  that has certainly not worked for Greece. That loss of monetary independence is now the main cause of their pain  humiliation and abject fiscal servitude. Loss of sovereignty has been a disaster for them.  Has it been much good for Britain – or indeed anyone else? How has the sovereignty-prosperity trade-off really worked out?  Let us look first at Britain  and the negative side of the ledger: the sacrifice of political independence. It is considerable. We have given up national determination over an amazing range of policy areas  from the hours worked by junior doctors to the right to strike international free trade deals; from levels of indirect tax to the composition of our sausages.  It has been recently estimated by the parliamentary authorities that about 65 per cent of all legislation passing through Westminster either originates in or is heavily influenced by Brussels.  I happen to think that this is not  in itself  especially healthy for democracy. The main reason why Ukip became so potent and so electorally dangerous was that when people wondered vaguely what their government could do about levels of EU immigration  they were amazed to discover that the answer was – nothing. That basic power  to decide who you were going to allow to settle in your country  had been given away.  Over decades  British politicians had given away powers that weren’t strictly theirs to give. They belonged to the people; and when the people asked for them back  they were told that the heirlooms were now locked in the silver cabinet in Brussels.  It was that sense of a loss of control that caused voters such fury – even people who were actually quite willing to be persuaded of the benefits of immigration. That is why Ukip got 14 per cent in the polls.  And yet I still think the British people would wear all this – all this loss of “sovereignty” – if the material gains were shown to be worthwhile. But can they? How has this experiment really worked out?  In the run-up to that 1992 single market  the EU published the Cecchini report  prophesying untold riches for the continent. By harmonising standards and blitzing national objections  the single market would unleash a frenzy of cross-border deal-making and dynamism. To a certain extent  that did indeed happen. But was it really attributable to Brussels?  And over the past 20 years  European growth has lagged way behind other regional economic groupings – Asean  Mercosur  Nafta – none of which has these elaborate sovereignty-sharing arrangements  with a peculiar parliament and court and a vast and ever-growing corpus of supranational law.  Indeed  you could surely argue that it is all this supranational regulation and legislation – so easily promulgated  so impossible to remove – that is now holding Europe back; one of the causes of endemic low growth and high unemployment virtually everywhere in the eurozone. The whole tendency of politics today is towards localism and devolution; and if we are going to give power to the nations and regions and cities of the UK  then surely it is time to give back powers to the countries of the EU.  The Greek debacle has immeasurably strengthened David Cameron’s hand in the run-up to the referendum  as Jeremy Warner pointed out on last week. The euro crisis has shattered the myth of euro-irreversibility  and shown the hollowness of the assumption that “shared” sovereignty leads to greater prosperity.  It is becoming ever clearer that the opposite case can be made – that economic growth will  in fact  come with devolution of powers back to people and parliaments. The time is approaching when Britain will need to set out its case for reform – and the case for boldness is growing by the day.,HER,status
Look  I am no seismologist. But I cannot agree with the people of the Malaysian province who claim that a recent fatal tremor was nothing short of divine retribution.  The tribal folk in the neighbourhood of Mount Kinabalu say that local deities – the aki – took violent exception to a group of streaking European tourists  and in particular a young British woman who loosened her girdle and shook her naked breasts at the mountain. They say that the spirits quivered in corresponding outrage. They say that the great earth mother was so outraged that she uncorseted herself and wobbled the peaks with such fury that 18 people died.  I think on the whole that this is mumbo-jumbo  and that there is a perfectly good scientific explanation. And yet  I am afraid that we in 21st-century Britain are in no position to snigger at the tribes and their fit of irrational indignation. We have our own mystery gods these days. We have our own chthonic powers  and when someone is deemed to have said or done something to cause offence to the great and implacable Moloch of Political Correctness  then the priests and priestesses of that religion will sometimes react with a vindictiveness – and a total lack of reason – that is in itself a kind of anthropological marvel.  Take the case of that great and good man  Professor Sir Tim Hunt. This world-famous British biologist has consecrated his life to the study of cells  and in the early Eighties he was looking at some sea urchins when he made a breakthrough. He discovered cyclins – crucial proteins that help somehow with cell development. He has won the Nobel prize and just about every other award; and last week  at the age of 72  he was giving a light-hearted  off-the-cuff speech to some scientific journalists in Seoul. Those remarks have prompted such global outrage that he has been stripped of honorary positions both at University College London and the Royal Society. In an interview at the weekend  he said that he was “finished” and that his career was at an end.  What did he say  to make the plaster fall off the ceiling? Why did the seismograph yaw so crazily? Well  he was speaking flippantly  ironically – or so he thought – about men and women working together in the lab. Or rather  he spoke about his own experience. “Let me tell you about my trouble with girls ” he said. “Three things happen when they are in the lab: you fall in love with them  they fall in love with you and when you criticise them  they cry.”  Now the first two observations are surely uncontentious. Men fall in love with women  women fall in love with men. It’s been going on a long time  and thank goodness  because otherwise our species would die out. It is the third point – about crying – that has earned him the wrath of the Twittersphere  and the most venomous hatred.  The first question to ask  when someone is accused of saying something unacceptable – even in a semi-satirical way – is whether or not that statement is true. Is there any foundation to this casual assertion  that women cry more readily than men?  Well  yes  there is. Some men cry at the drop of a hat: Churchill was famously lacrimose. But the world’s leading expert on crying  Professor Ad Vingerhoets of Tilburg University  has shown that women on average cry 30-64 times a year  while men cry only between six and 17 times a year; and the Dutchman also claims that women cry for an average of six minutes  while men cry for only two to three minutes.  All sorts of biological explanations are offered. Men are said to have differently shaped tear ducts  for instance  and can therefore retain the tears for longer before they splash down the cheek. Women are said to have more prolactin  a hormone associated with weeping. I would have thought that all this stuff could be filed as the latest stunning discovery from the University of the Bleeding Obvious.  Whether you say it is a function of biology or social expectation  it is a fact that – on the whole – men and women express emotion differently. There is  in other words  a gender difference  and it should not be an offence to say that.  There are plenty of gender differences in education – many ways in which male and female students seem to respond differently to the pressures of the system. Last year saw record university admissions in Britain – more than half a million – which is a cause for rejoicing. What some have found more worrying  however  is the growing numerical lead enjoyed by women. There are far more female university entrants than male entrants – 58 000 more last year  leading the head of UCAS  Mary Curnock Cook  to say that men will have to be regarded as an “under-represented group”.  Women also tend to do better at university  with 72 per cent getting an upper second or better  compared with only 67 per cent of men. Girls outperform boys at A-level  and the gap at GCSE is the biggest for 10 years. The only conclusion is that boys  on the whole  are doing significantly less well at school than girls. Does this mean that they are thicker than girls? Of course not. The differences in performance between male and female students – whether in scientific labs or more generally – are nothing to do with innate ability  and everything to do with social and cultural expectations  and the way they are taught.  At the moment we are failing to unlock the talents of both sexes because we are failing to grasp that they are intellectually equal but in some ways emotionally different. Until we work out how to handle and how to compensate for these gender differences  we will continue to see too few female scientists  and too many male kids who are getting left behind by the system.  The first step is to recognise that these emotional differences do indeed exist  and to be honest about them. Sir Tim Hunt was doing what he has done all his life – pointing out a natural phenomenon he had observed. He did not deserve to be pilloried  and should be reinstated forthwith to his academic positions.,HER,status
Looking back  I can remember clearly when I first had an inkling of the disaster. It was the night before the fatal vote in 2010  and we in the England delegation were summoned to that swanky Zurich hotel where the Fifa hierarchs like to do their deals.  It must have been about 10pm. Somewhere upstairs the Prime Minister was schmoozing a series of mendacious figures from the world of international football. Prince William was on another doomed mission somewhere else. I found myself in a dimly lit bar  drinking beer with Gary Lineker and Fabio Capello  while keeping an eye on the door.  Our instructions were simple. If any Fifa executive walked in  we were to make ourselves as pleasant as we decently could. We were to inveigle ourselves into their society  to tell self-deprecating jokes  to put them at their ease in the approved British manner – in short  to use whatever feeble charms we possessed to persuade them to vote for us.  I managed to join a group from – I think – Latin America. They were full of fun and life. They loved London  they adored England  they recognised our role in the creation of football. But would they vote for us? I looked into their merry faces; I scanned their eyes for a clue; and I was none the wiser.  My tension grew. We all knew that the case for England 2018 was superb; we knew that by every measure of logic and fairness we should be serious contenders to host the World Cup. But what was actually going to happen? At length I sought out the nice young British executive who had been put in charge of the PR for our bid - and I asked him straight out; and I will never forget the look I saw in his eyes – a look of sudden and terrifying candour.  I had talked to him for months  on and off  and had never known him to deviate from a tone of buoyant optimism. We had sketched out all sorts of scenarios for success  and they each depended on progressing to the second round. If X country or Y country were eliminated  we would tell ourselves  then all their first round votes would transfer to us.  By the second round we would be in an immensely strong position. Fortified with the votes of X or Y  we would scorch into the third round – and  bingo! Everyone would vote for England as the safe bet  and it would be Three Lions on a Shirt  Jules Rimet gleaming again in Wembley  and a general feeling of orgiastic national good humour.  England would host the greatest tournament of the world’s most popular game for the first time since 1966 – and all we had to do was get through that first round of voting. But could we? “I don’t know ” said our campaign manager in a whisper. “I have moments when I just can’t see where our votes are coming from.”  As we were to see the following day  he was right to be nervous. It was a rout  a fiasco  a moment of national humiliation and derision. England was blown a collective raspberry in a global version of the Eurovision song contest. Nobody’s votes transferred to us  because we beat nobody. We managed to be kicked out first with nul points and only two votes  one of which came from the English chap on Fifa.  And ever since I have asked myself why we bombed so badly. We seemed to have such a good case. England had given the game to the world  and yet we hadn’t hosted the Cup for two generations. We had by far the most developed markets for TV and advertising. We had a football-loving public. Above all we had the infrastructure to put on a world-class sporting event  as we showed beyond doubt in 2012.  And it isn’t as if we failed to woo the Fifa executives. When their delegation was in town  we made sure their traffic lights were always on green  like a series of invisible butlers holding open the doors of a palace. I even joined the 32-stone Chuck Blazer for breakfast – or for one of his series of breakfasts. Blatter  I am afraid  was treated with a reverence that was positively emetic. And none of it was enough.  Now  thanks in large part to the indefatigable work of the British press  we now appear to know the reason. The whole Fifa edifice was and is weevilled with apparent corruption. While other countries turned a blind eye  the Americans have stepped in. The US has an extraordinary doctrine – that if you commit a crime by using an American banking network then you have committed a crime under American law and must answer to America; and if it brings the kleptocrats of Fifa to justice  then I am all for it.  I hope that the law now takes its course: that Sepp Blatter is finally forced to take responsibility for what appears to have happened on his watch  and to resign. If they had any sense of honour the sponsors would now pull the plug on this plainly fraudulent organisation.  In an ideal world the guilty would be convicted and Fifa would be wound up and replaced – as I have long since argued – by a more transparent and accountable body. I have to say  alas  that I am not entirely certain that things will turn out this way. As both the US and Swiss investigators acknowledge  bribery is difficult to prove.  And then there is a further geopolitical problem. You and I may rejoice at the notion of Britain and America triumphing in the final reel of the movie – James Bond and Felix Leiter coming together to winkle Blofeld from his lair. Not everyone sees it that way; not everyone likes the idea of an Anglo-American imperium. You may have noted that the French and Spanish Fifa wallahs decided  amazingly  to vote for Blatter.  All we can do is watch events  send whatever evidence we have to the Americans  and live in hope. And if the Swiss police indeed show that the 2010 contest was corrupted  then it will have to be re-run. London stands ready.,HER,status
"That is the great thing about the English ” said the Greek elder statesman – and I pricked up my ears. There is nothing nicer than a compliment from some well-travelled foreigner. He went on: “The English know how to…” And my mind raced. The English know how to do many things  but we cannot claim to have a monopoly of wisdom. The Italians are pretty good at making ice cream. The Germans know how to make machine tools. The Americans are so far the only people who know how to put a man on the Moon. What is our special subject in the global mastermind competition?  I waited  with bated breath. Do we know how to cook  how to fight  how to make love  how to brew a nice cup of tea? Of course we do – but do we have such knowledge more abundantly than any other 21st-century country? “The English ” he repeated  putting me out of my misery  “know how to vote.” And – ah! I saw what he meant. I have been in Greece for about 48 hours  in order to conduct some first-hand research into the euro crisis. I have been amazed by the general level of pessimism among intelligent  professional Greeks.  They look at the recent UK elections  and they say they are full of envy for the British population: because we voted so decisively for the Conservatives and common sense. They look at their own government  and they shudder. They have a sense of impending doom  they tell me – and at first you wonder why. You go to the Cyclades  and you can’t see any reason why the Greeks should be jealous of us. It looks like paradise  at least from where I sit here in my taverna with my flagon of retsina. There are helicopters thwokking through the sky as they take Greek billionaires to their luxy villas; there are Greek playboys and girls biffing their high-speed powerboats over the wine-dark sea; and there is an endless procession of planes arriving from the less sunny and less fortunate parts of Europe  full of pasty-faced tourists lusting to spend their euros and pounds.  This is Greece  for heaven’s sake  the fountainhead of European civilisation and democracy  where Phoebus rose  where Delos sprung. What can possibly go wrong? It seems incredible that we can still – five years later – be talking about the risk that Greece will manage to eject itself from the euro. It is unbelievable that the collective brains of the EU and the IMF should have failed to sort this out. And yet it could indeed go wrong: that is the view of the Greeks I have talked to in the past couple of days. Through a mixture of impatience and irritation and sheer incompetence on both sides we could see the Greeks accidentally-on-purpose hitting the red button and kapow! They could be blasted through the canopy and out of the European cockpit and end up landing back in the Russian sphere of influence.  It seems bizarre that the world is risking this geo-political convulsion  when the sums at stake are so relatively small. Next month the Greeks must pay back about £1.5 billion that they owe to the IMF  and  as of Sunday  they were being mulish about it. At least one Greek minister was quoted as saying that they couldn’t pay  wouldn’t pay. Go whistle  he said.  If he is serious  he means that the Greeks are finally going to default; and what happens then will all depend on mass psychology – on what that default will mean not just to their creditors but to the Greeks themselves. According to the gloomsters  the Greeks will take it badly. They will decide that it is conclusive proof that they can no longer manage their own affairs  and that their government cannot be trusted with anybody’s money; and having briefly uttered a Sophoclean wail they will go to the banks to withdraw their cash.  The current bank “jog” will become a run  and then a stampede. The Greek banks will be neither solvent nor liquid  and the only hope would be some further bail-out from the European Central Bank – and the thinking now is that Mario Draghi  the governor  has exhausted his options. To pour more money into Greece would be neither legal nor prudent – and a bit of an insult to all those European countries that have done the right thing and paid their debts. The Greeks are already desperate for cash  to pay their pensioners  to pay public servants – even to pay for medicines.  Greeks are suffering hardships now that we can barely imagine. Faced with a banking meltdown  and no more cash from Europe  they would have no choice but to reinvent the drachma  print money  and take back control of their own affairs.  It would be horrendously difficult  and painful  and it would probably involve hyperinflation and a long period in which no international lenders would go near the place. The Greeks would almost certainly find themselves drawn closer to Putin and Moscow – with all sorts of baleful implications. The contagion might indeed spread to other eurozone countries. We surely can’t let it happen. But what is the alternative?  The only other way forward is for the Greeks to swallow the German medicine  no matter how nasty it tastes. They will have to make the reforms they have dodged for so long; they will have to purge their bureaucracy of the Byzantine non-jobs; they will have to get people to pay their taxes and to obey the law. In a word  they will have to become a little less Greek and a little more German – and it will hurt. On Sunday morning I tramped with the sunburnt hordes through the holy precincts of Delos  and I remembered how the Delian league had evolved from a brotherhood of sovereign states into an Athenian empire.  Today it is the eurozone that is becoming an empire  and Germany the semi-reluctant hegemon. That is the choice the Greeks must make: between a painful and perhaps chaotic independence; or a grinding economic subjection  endured in the hope of long-term behavioural change. Either course will require leadership of a high order. They will have to know how to vote.,HER,status
The other day  I was trying to persuade a political friend of the urgency of doing something to save Palmyra. To be fair to him he understood the horror of what could happen in the next few days. My friend had never been to the ancient city  so I tried to evoke the glory of the colonnades  the temples  the sculptures.  I explained the sense of wonder that fills the visitor as you watch the dawn break on these vast fields of rosy old masonry  the amazement at coming far into the deserts of Arabia and finding structures that derive so plainly from ancient Greece and Rome. I think I got across my almost-physical sickness at the idea of surrendering this urban masterpiece to the monsters of Isil.  I told him of my terror of the sledgehammers and the dynamite of these moronic iconoclasts  and I think he understood where I was coming from.  Gently  however  he posed the obvious question: why Palmyra? Why now? After all  we in the West have collectively decided to do very little to help hundreds of thousands of Syrian human beings. How can I justify an intervention on behalf of inanimate objects? There is  frankly  no easy rejoinder. The saving of human life should always come first. Nor is Isil unique in performing acts of awful cultural destruction: think of Dresden.  No nation is entirely guiltless of such crimes. Yet I want to convince you today that there would be something peculiarly catastrophic about the loss of Palmyra; and it is not just the superb quality of the remains – one of the truly breathtaking sites of the ancient world  fully deserving its UN world heritage status. I believe there is something more at stake in Palmyra – and that is the very idea of our Western civilisation and what we stand for.  The more you learn about the Palmyrenes  the more modern they seem to be. For centuries  the city was a great Greco-Romano-Semitic crossroads. Everybody went there  from across that immense and peaceful empire – from Scotland to Libya  from Portugal to Serbia and Iraq.  They gabbled away in their mile-long shopping arcade  in Amorite and Aramaic and Arabic and Jewish and Greek and (a little) in Latin; and they borrowed from each other’s culture with an exuberant promiscuity.  They had Roman baths and Greek theatres  and they mummified their dead in the fashion of the Egyptians. They had all sorts of government – oriental kings and Greek archons and Roman senators  sometimes at the same time. Insofar as the Romans were  for a long time  the dominant power  they positively encouraged local diversity  especially in religion and the worship of all types of Mesopotamian divinities.  Even after the Palmyrenes rebelled in the 3rd century  the emperor Aurelian rebuilt the temple of Bel.  And  of course  there were changes over the thousands of years: one type of temple gave way to another  and the temples then became churches  and the churches eventually became mosques. But never in its history has Palmyra faced a threat as brutal as today. Every conquering army  every general that has ever gone there has found something to admire.  Every succeeding culture has been generally willing to preserve and often to embellish. Not today – not these people. The maniacs of Isil are so narcissistic and so generally up themselves that they cannot cope with the idea of a great culture that predates Islam. They are so pathetic  so troubled  so fearful  so small  that they are driven to destroy – because they apparently cannot stand beauty; they cannot abide representations of the human form; and some of them are seemingly the kind of self-hating homosexuals who throw gays off cliffs.  They stand in polar opposition to modern Western values; and – perhaps more importantly  in case anyone should be tempted to make the mistake of any general Islamophobia – they are of course a complete betrayal of the legacy of the great mediaeval Muslim scholars: men like Avicenna and Averroes  without whose intercessions so much of classical learning – including the Platonic and Aristotelian foundations of our thinking – would have been lost.  Their behaviour is an abomination to all of us  Muslims and non-Muslims alike  and we cannot allow them to continue with their public and juvenile desecration of everything that is good and beautiful.  One day  Syria will return to some kind of peace. What hope for the Syrian economy  what hope for the tourist industry  if we allow them to smash Palmyra? Even if we had the time and the money  we could not hope to rebuild the ruins – not without producing some ludicrous Disneyland effect.  We have lost so much already: Nimrud and Hatra have gone; large parts of Aleppo have been wrecked. If we don’t make a stand now  in the face of this barbarism  when will we stick up for our common human heritage? What about the Umayyad mosque in Damascus – is that to be condemned for having gorgeous figurative Byzantine mosaics? Must we prepare ourselves for the loss of Leptis Magna?  If this violence goes on unchecked  it is not too fanciful to imagine the loonies taking over – some time in the next decades – in Egypt itself. Presumably their ideology would demand the dynamiting of the Pyramids  Karnak  Luxor. The whole thing is evil  unthinkable – and yet it could be about to happen tomorrow in Palmyra.  I accept that some readers will be left cold by an appeal on behalf of a bunch of ruins. But I can’t see it like that. For me  Palmyra embodies the great ideas we owe to the Greeks and the Romans: openness  generosity to other cultures – and above all the ideal of religious and intellectual freedom and tolerance. That is worth fighting for.  It may not be too late for some kind of exclusion zone around the site  or at least for air strikes. I would hope that our country  at the UN  would lead the world in calling for action and resistance. This isn’t a clash of civilisations. It’s a struggle between civilisation and nihilism  and a fight we must win.,HER,status
Look – I hesitate to put it this way but  quite frankly: I told you so.  I have been saying for weeks that the sublime instincts of the British people would urge them to vote Tory. Time after time  under pressure from a journalist  I have explained that in the privacy of the voting booth the people would find their hands twitching crablike towards the Tory box and that with a final almost unconscious spasm they would put their cross by the party that offered the best hope of stable economic growth – and powee: look at what has happened.  This has been the most amazing election of modern times; and that is because the rout of the Labour Party and the ruination of the Liberal Democrats have been accompanied by the wholesale and hilarious humiliation of the pundits. The press was wrong  the pollsters were wrong  the pontificators were wrong and – joy of joys – Alastair Campbell has been forced to eat his kilt on live TV.  Why this orgy of error? Almost everyone underestimated the “shy Tories” – the people who secretly agreed with the case that the Conservatives were making  but didn’t want to make a big deal of it. There were millions of people who accepted the thrust of the argument – that you need a strong and dynamic economy to have great public services. They just weren’t sure  when interrogated by pollsters  that they necessarily wanted to be associated with the Conservative Party.  We Conservatives need to reflect on that; we need to show the world that our case is every bit as moral and compassionate as the case for socialism – in fact  that it is more compassionate than socialism. We need our supporters to feel they can be proud and open Tories: that there is no need for shyness at all. We need to show by our good intentions that they can publicly flock to our banner – and not just in Britain. Yes  my friends  there are shy Tories everywhere in the European Union!  What is the number one challenge for this fresh and confident British government? To find allies around the table in Brussels  as we prepare for the reform of the treaties and an in/out referendum in this country. Already we are told by the experts that there is nothing doing  that no one sympathises with Britain – and that we won’t get a sausage  or even a chipolata  from our friends in Brussels. The markets are taking this negative stuff seriously  and learned Financial Times commentators are so scathing about our negotiating abilities that they are warning about the risk of “Brexit” – a popular vote to leave the EU – because we will fail to get the changes we need.  Well  for the sake of their blood pressure and their professional reputations  I urge these pundits to put a sock in it. I have every confidence that our negotiators  led by David Cameron  will be able to achieve a reform that is in the interests not just of Britain but the whole of Europe; and that is because there are so many other EU governments who now agree – shyly  bashfully  discreetly – with so much of what we are saying.  Let’s take immigration  by far the most contentious issue. We are not asking for the drawbridge to be yanked up; we don’t want to expel all hard-working immigrants. We are merely asking for a four-year delay on the payment of benefits to EU migrants – a suggestion that has been greeted with Batemanesque outrage by some Lefty Euro-federalists in the UK. What these British commentators fail to understand is that there are other northern EU governments who also have lavish means-tested benefits systems  and who are worried about the impact of immigration on public services. The Swedes already insist that EU incomers must have health insurance before using the Swedish health care system – a stipulation we have yet to make even in this country.  My point is that we have potential supporters  even among countries that have been traditionally reluctant to be associated with the curmudgeonly British; and as with the shy Tories  they are increasingly with us on the biggest issue of all – the economy. The EU is still a microclimate of gloom  and the best and cheapest way to kickstart growth is to complete the single market.  Indeed  that is how we should present these reforms – as a package to generate jobs and economic confidence: and like the original single market  with its potent 1992 deadline  we should agree the Treaty by 2017  and set a deadline for completion by  say  2020.  Across Europe we have companies that are failing to expand or invest because they cannot get access to cash or credit  because the banks are still in shock and chronically leery of lending. We need to complete the market in financial services not just because it is massively in the interest of the UK  but because it is in the interest of every European company that needs access to the capital markets to help it grow. Put it like that and we will win our case.  We have support in liberalising energy markets – from the Spanish and now from the eastern Europeans who are nervous of Putin’s grip on gas supplies. We have the backing of almost everyone in feeling that the 48-hour week is absurd in its impact on junior doctors. There are plenty of countries which would like to see the liberalising of the retail sector  especially in Germany. Loads of countries – especially France – can see that it is mad for one rich country to send EU “regional funds” to another rich country  rather than focusing on the truly needy areas. Every government  without exception  will agree to give a greater role to existing national parliaments.  These reforms – completing the Thatcherian vision of the single market – will be good not just for Britain  but for families and businesses across Europe. It is the right way forward for Europe  and never in our lifetimes has a British prime minister had such an opportunity to lead the way. And that is because there are plenty of people in Brussels who agree – however secretly and shyly – with what we are saying.,HER,status
Morning folks. Just want to say a HUGE thank you to everyone who voted Conservative and elected David Cameron to lead our great country. I would especially like to thank the people of Uxbridge and South Ruislip for electing me to represent them. There is a great amount of work to do over the next five years - to improve quality of life  build more homes  increase job opportunities for all  and secure our economic growth. Let's get to it.,HER,status
Delighted to have voted Conservative. I would like to wish all Conservative candidates the best of luck. Polls are still open until 10pm so please don't forget to vote so as to keep David Cameron in Number 10  and secure the economic growth that this country needs.,HER,photo

It’s the smugness that gets me. It’s the brass-necked complacency. As a piece of premature chicken-counting combined with insolent disrespect to the will of the electorate  this Labour stunt is frankly unbeatable.  Never mind measuring the curtains for Downing Street  Ed Miliband is so confident of victory this Thursday that he has already commissioned a vast monument to himself. He has caused a stonemason to engrave an 8ft 6in slab of limestone with a series of fine-sounding but essentially vacuous slogans  as if this were East Germany circa 1973  and he has promised – nay  sworn – that on the very first day of his regime the work will be religiously installed in the garden of the prime minister’s offices.  In true totalitarian fashion  he has signed it himself  and appended the red-rose Socialist logo of the Labour Party.  When someone showed me a pic of Ed in front of this absurdity  I thought it was a joke  some photoshopped wheeze.  It is no joke  my friends. This thing exists  and Ed fully intends that this tasteless  verbless  truthless stele should loom over No 10 like some kitsch version of the laws of Hammurabi  or some new Decalogue – except that he couldn’t think of 10 things to say.  What was he drinking? What was he smoking? What was he on when he came up with this one? Keep taking the tablets  Ed – don’t erect them in government offices. There are all sorts of people who are capable of putting a stop to this vandalism. If (heaven forfend) Ed Miliband were indeed to find himself in Downing Street this week  then the head of the Civil Service would quietly tell him not to be such a confounded idiot. No 10 is a department of state; you can’t use it for party-political propaganda. Imagine the hoo-ha if I had festooned City Hall with the Conservative logo  after we kicked out the Labour administration in 2008.  Then there is Westminster Council  for whose punctilious planning department I have deep respect. No 10 is a Grade I-listed building. Would they allow it to be desecrated with some weird commie slab? No way.  But there is another far more important person who can kibosh the whole thing – and that  of course  is you: you  the dear  the gentle  the reader who has already put up with so much election coverage and who is now about to take centre stage.  You can stop Ed and his monument; you can stop him stone dead. After all the yarping and the carping from the media and the politicos  it is time for you to have your say; and on Thursday you have a decision-making tool more powerful than 100 TV studios or a million barrels of newspaper ink. You have the stubby pencil and the bit of paper  and you hold the destiny of the country in your hands.  It will take only 23 more seats to give the Conservatives the stability of an absolute majority – something that is now completely beyond the reach of the Labour Party. So wherever you are voting  I hope you will consider why Ed Miliband reached for this preposterous gimmick. Why carve slogans in stone? Why pretend that there is something imperishable about his words? Why go to these lengths to tell us there is something fixed and rocklike about his agenda? Why? Because he knows – and he knows that we know – that the opposite is the case.  If this country were to make the tragic mistake of electing Ed Miliband and the Labour Party  we would usher in perhaps the most intrinsically weak government of modern times. Far from being graven in stone  his words would not be worth the paper they were written on. Miliband knows that his intentions would count for nothing – that he could not get a single bill through the Commons – without the approval of the Scottish Nationalists. He wouldn’t be Moses or Hammurabi; he would be rapidly transformed into the obsequious butler of Downing Street  constantly tending to the demands of fiery Aunt Nicola  always making sure that Alec Salmond was topped up with pink champagne – and at the expense of the English taxpayer.  Britain’s political stability would be seriously weakened. The two parties plainly despise each other  and already fight like ferrets in a sack. The economy would be weakened  as Labour and SNP competed to impose a series of smash-and-grab policies that would simply discourage enterprise and drive away investment. British public services would be weakened by the consequent fall in economic confidence and tax revenues. Britain’s defences would be weakened  as the Scots Nats campaigned for nuclear disarmament; and Britain’s standing abroad would be weakened by Miliband’s refusal to take on the British responsibility – to lead reform in Europe  and then put those reforms to the British people in a referendum.  With the eurozone still in turmoil  with a revanchist Putin  with the American economy wobbling again  there is only one way to give this country the strong leadership it needs – and that is to give David Cameron and the Conservatives five more years. We have come back from a terrible recession – exacerbated by Miliband and Ed Balls – to be one of the fastest-growing economies in the West  with dizzying growth in employment and new businesses. This country has amazing potential standing at the crossroads of the global economy: the commercial  cultural  creative  tech  medical and university capital of Europe if not the world – and still a huge manufacturing power.  Our mission now must be to ensure that more people share in that success across the country  to raise productivity  and to harness a more dynamic market economy to help pay for the poor  the needy  and better and better public services. I cannot believe that people will want to put that at risk  and to return to the Seventies nostrums of Labour. The Tories need another five years to embed and extend the considerable achievements of this coalition.  Let us therefore consign Milibandias and his tombstone to the bafflement of future archaeologists. Let it go down as the last act of a desperate candidate  and the heaviest suicide note in history.,HER,status

It was in 1989  as communism was imploding across the world  that the Vietnamese foreign minister gave a press conference in which he discussed the most fatuous mistakes of his fellow revolutionary socialists. For sheer bone-headed stupidity  said Nguyen co Thach  there was one policy that stood out. It was more destructive than American bombing  he claimed. It was worse than the B52s and did more long-term economic damage than the napalming of the jungle.  “The Americans couldn’t destroy Hanoi ” he said. “But we have destroyed our city.” Overcrowding was worse than ever; buildings were collapsing or in an advanced state of disrepair – and new ones were no longer being built. What was this policy? It was rent controls – exactly the policy that Ed Miliband announced yesterday in a classic attempt to get a headline while proposing diametrically the wrong thing for the economy.  The story of rent controls has been the same everywhere they have been tried. Until they were abandoned  rent controls in Seventies Britain led to a catastrophic fall in the number of rented properties available  and they did nothing to stop unscrupulous Rachmanite landlords. Rent controls accelerated the woeful degradation of much of New York’s housing stock  and in so far as there has been a boom in New York property  it has taken place in housing not subject to rent controls.  The Swedish economist Assar Lindbeck has said that rent control is “the most effective technique presently known to destroy a city – except for bombing”; and the reason he has come to that conclusion is that experience has shown that it is an idiotic way to tackle the problem of high rents.  Everyone is familiar with the struggle of Generation Rent. Even readers who are owner-occupiers will have friends or relatives who have seen their rents rise to eye-watering levels. No one could fail to have sympathy with their plight. But if we are to have any chance of solving the problem  we must understand what has really caused it.  In London – where more and more people are being driven to rent at ever higher prices – two factors have come together to produce a crisis. The first is the sheer popularity and success of the city. London is the most dynamic urban economy in Europe  with a growing population and an enormous demand for housing. And that demand has been exacerbated  secondly  by the total failure of the previous Labour government – in which Ed Miliband served – to build enough homes. Don’t just take it from me. As Miliband admitted himself in 2010  after he had been (rightly) kicked out of office: “We refused to prioritise the building of new social housing”. Or as Ed Balls put it: “Labour was wrong…We were late in recognising the importance of building more homes  and more affordable homes.”  One of the Labour members of the London Assembly  Tom Copley  has even called for the party to apologise for its failure to build more homes. As you might expect from Labour politicians  they are in fact understating the scale of the disaster  or their role in it. In the 13 years of the Labour government  housebuilding plunged to its lowest level since the Twenties. They saw the number of available affordable homes fall by 200 000; and indeed – this is the statistic that should really make them hang their heads with shame – they built fewer council homes in 13 years than Mrs Thatcher did in one year of her premiership.  Nor were things any better for those looking to buy on the open market: under Labour  the number of first-time buyers collapsed to the lowest levels since the Seventies; and perhaps no wonder  when you consider that Labour has always been suspicious of home-ownership – and the feelings of pride  autonomy and independence that go with it. In short: Labour failed dismally to build enough homes during the long years of the boom – and it is that failure we Tories have been trying our utmost  and with increasing success  to rectify.  In London  we are well on target now to deliver a record 100 000 new affordable homes over the life of this mayoralty; and there are more homes being built – just look at the cranes – than at any time since the early Eighties. These homes are for social rent  for part-buy-part-rent  for market sale and for market rent. For years now  we have been working to get the big pension funds and insurers to use their billions for the good of this country – by funding the building of tens of thousands of good new homes  for private rent  on brownfield sites. We are finally getting there. We have about 13 000 new rental homes in the pipeline – and the fear is that if their rents are unfairly controlled  these investors will just walk away; construction will halt; and we will be back to the inertia of the Labour years.  Now I suppose you might not care much about killing off new supply; you might think it would be a fine thing just to clobber existing landlords  force them to hold down rents. The result  alas  would be the exact opposite. All experience  in Britain and around the world  has shown that rent-controlled landlords let their buildings decay; and far from holding down rents  the three-year freeze would simply encourage landlords to whack them up sharply at the beginning and the end of the tenancy. This policy means higher rents  fewer homes  and general dilapidation. Like so much of Miliband’s agenda  it means going back to the Seventies.  It is not the way forward for Britain. The way forward is to build hundreds of thousands of higher-quality homes  including for market rent; to insist that landlords conform to the London Rental Standard in maintaining their properties; and to help people – as we are – with their rental deposit  interest-free. With the pressures now on the housing market  it is mad to pursue policies that would actively throttle new building and throttle the rental market  and if Miliband won’t listen to me  he should pay attention to his ideological kinsmen in formerly commie Vietnam. This isn’t a new policy. Lefties have been there  done it  and they know it is a disaster.,HER,status

You wouldn’t get Herod to run a baby farm  would you? It would not normally occur to you to interview a convicted jewel thief for the post of custodian of the Tower of London.  You would not dream of asking a fox to look after the henhouse or a temperance campaigner to run a brewery or Attila the Hun to work as a doorkeeper for the Roman senate – and no one in their right mind would enter into a contract with a bunch of voracious weevils to protect the lovely old timbers in the tower of the local church. Would they?  Any such course of action would be totally nuts. So can someone tell me why in the name of all that is holy there are some apparently rational people who are even contemplating the elevation of the Scottish Nationalist Party to a position of effective dominance in the government of the United Kingdom – an entity that they are sworn to destroy?  That is their charter  their aim  their ambition  their mission statement: to overturn last year’s referendum  and to break us up. They want to end Britain  to decapitate Britannia  to cause a constitutional upheaval that would gravely weaken this country  a rupture that has provoked horror in Britain’s friends around the world – and a silent chuckle among those who do not wish us quite so well.  And yet it is now clear that it is only with the help of the SNP – a party that is literally anti-British – that Ed Miliband can have any hope of governing this country. The Labour implosion in Scotland means that his chances of forming a majority government are now put at less than 1 per cent.  If Miliband is to occupy Downing Street  he will have to do it either by means of a formal coalition with Salmond/Sturgeon  or with an arrangement called confidence and supply  by which the Scots Nats agree to help knock his legislation through the Commons.  It is therefore obvious to every serious political analyst that he would be in many ways the plaything of the SNP. Unless he has the support of that 40-plus bloc of Scottish secessionists  he will be stymied. If Miliband somehow manages to form a minority government  he will be peeping from Alec Salmond’s sporran like a baffled baby kangaroo. He would be the vacillating Macbeth  pushed hither and yon by Lady Macbeth  in the form of Nicola Sturgeon.  Did you see her the other night  telling him to man up  to screw his courage to the sticking place – to do what she told him to do because “you are not strong enough on your own”? The awful truth is that she is right. Without her help and her say-so  and without the support of Salmond and his troops in the Commons  there is not a single bill that Labour could get through. It is a recipe for chaos; and worse than chaos – because the SNP has changed over the years.  The reason they have lampreyed the life out of Labour in Scotland is that they have become ever more Left wing. Miliband is already the most Left-wing Labour leader since Michael Foot  promoting an agenda that seems to be avowedly hostile to wealth creation and “predatory” capitalism. The SNP are Lefties on steroids. They want to abandon any attempt to get the deficit under control  and indeed the Treasury has calculated that they would borrow another £148 billion.  They think taxes are far too low in Britain  and would seek new “progressive” taxes on top of what Labour is already proposing. They would scrap Trident  denuding Britain of its nuclear deterrent and sending future prime ministers naked into the conference chamber. The SNP would junk all attempts to reform the welfare system – even though they have the support of most voters in this country  and indeed most Labour voters.  They seem to dislike anything to do with America or free trade  and so would ditch the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  even though the deal would be good for the UK economy. On many of these issues they would of course be opposed  initially  by many Labour MPs. But what could they do? Unless Miliband plays ball  he will be powerless to legislate. He would lose the confidence of parliament  and he would be chucked out.  Yes  he will be sitting in the driving seat  pretending to be steering the car – but all the time he will have clever Nicola next to him  whispering in his ear  and perpetually yanking the steering wheel to the Left. Eventually there will be another terrible crash  just as there was in 2008/9.  But why should the SNP care a hoot about that? There is a grim sense in which the worst outcome for the UK is also – for a party that wants to break up the UK – the best.  Miliband’s proposed deal with the Scots Nats is like the fable of the frog that agrees to carry the scorpion across the river. In the end he will get stung – because that is the nature of the beast.  The risk is that by the end of this calamitous partnership there will be so many people in England who are cheesed off by the SNP’s behaviour that they will be only too happy to bid Scotland goodbye; and anybody thinking of voting Ukip should realise that by putting in a Labour/SNP alliance they are going to turn the UK into the Former UK  and their party will have to be called FUKIP.  Keep the Tories and you keep the Beefeaters guarding the Tower; you let farmers protect their chickens with their own shotguns; you keep out Attila and other roaming Eastern European criminals with tougher immigration controls; you keep Britain’s booming breweries and distilleries exporting overseas with ever-greater confidence; you repair the church tower with the VAT refund introduced by George Osborne – and as for the crèche that was in danger of being run by Herod  you fund ever better child care with the 30-hour free care announced in the manifesto.  Vote Tory to stop a Labour/SNP coalition from wrecking the country – a choice  as I may have mentioned before  between competence and chaos.,HER,status
The other day I was driving past the port at Bristol and I saw all those thousands of cars lined up on the quayside – and whoa… I did a double take. There they were: phalanx upon phalanx of shiny new vehicles glinting like Dinky toys in the sun; and I suddenly realised that they weren’t arriving in this country.  These cars hadn’t just disembarked from France or Germany or Japan. They were about to make their own journey overseas – they were British cars  for goodness sake.  They were examples of British manufacturing and design and engineering – and they were about to be loaded on to ships and taken to other European countries  and to Africa  and Asia; and I reflected on one of the most stunning turnaround stories in the economic history of this country.  Britain last year produced more than 1.5 million cars – the most since 2007 – and we are poised to overtake France and become the second biggest car manufacturing power in Europe.   Across the West Midlands – and indeed across the country – there are now literally thousands of businesses  large and small  that are engaged in automotive innovation and supply; and there was a time when no one would have believed that was possible.  I remember the 1970s. You  too  may remember that mullet- haired decade. The music was superb  the food was mediocre  and British industry was on its knees.   I remember when our motor manufacturing industry was in the hands of ‘conveners’ and ‘shop stewards’  and when the man who ran British Leyland – then our biggest car company – appeared to be an avowedly communist trade union official called Red Robbo.  When I was a child I am afraid to say that British cars were the butt of international derision. They leaked oil  and they were generally assembled with such slovenly imprecision they gained a reputation for unreliability that it has taken decades to shake off.  Lemon after lemon rolled off our production lines  culminating in the ludicrous rustbucket called the Austin Allegro – and there was a reason for the disaster. We had atrocious relations between management and unions  and a legal framework that gave all the power to the unions.  We had a Labour government that believed companies existed not to serve the needs of the market  or the desires of their customers – but to satisfy the rights of their workers.   We had an era of tea breaks and ‘demarcation disputes’ and closed shops and one-out-all-out strikes  with the Labour government trying to impose such insane solutions as Tony Benn’s communist-style motorbike ‘collective’ at Meriden. It did not work then  and it seems to me to be deranged that we could be even contemplating going back to such arrangements now.  I am not surprised to discover that one of the key authors of the Labour Party manifesto is my former adversary Ken Livingstone  who has long been on the Bennite wing.   By Ed Miliband’s own admission  Livingstone has been a big influence in his thinking – and in their return to the Benn/Livingstone approach Labour’s plans are truly nightmarish for business and enterprise.  Miliband is turning the Labour Party sharply back to the Left  and actively repudiating the chief insight of Tony Blair – that the party can only be successful if it makes a sensible accommodation with capitalism and the market economy.   That is why British business people are so unanimous in their horror  including many former Labour supporters and donors.  They are not wrong. Labour wants to hit small- and medium- sized businesses with more corporation tax and higher national insurance – but it is worse than that. They want to recreate the stifling environment of the 1970s  in which management was deprived of the ability to manage.  They want to make it easier for employees to take firms to employment tribunals – when you might think the system was already out of control  with people endlessly and automatically and indeed very often vexatiously claiming racial or sexual or age or disability discrimination.  They want all companies with more than 50 employees to have a system of profit-sharing – a return to Bennery – and they want the workers to be able to block takeovers.  That is before you have even begun to calculate the impact of their attacks on the City  higher income tax  and the higher interest rates that small firms would have to cope with – the result of Labour’s failure to tackle the deficit. What makes this anti-capitalist agenda so dangerous is that the British motor manufacturing industry is not in the hands of a few giant firms.  We are talking about huge numbers of often tiny companies – firms that pride themselves on making a more efficient windscreen-wiper or a quieter air-conditioning unit or a more easily wipeable dashboard fascia. It is incredible but true that Britain now has more specialised motor manufacturing marques than any country on earth – Lotus  McLaren  Bristol  Morgan  Caterham  TVR… the list goes on.  Think of London’s new hop-on hop-off Routemaster bus  a glorious piece of low-carbon technology and one of the greenest new buses on the market – made in Northern Ireland by Wrightbus. The West Midlands is once again the epicentre of one of the world’s densest ecosystems of motor manufacturing and development.  How mad  how tragic  that this extraordinary British triumph should be faced with a Labour government that regards capitalism as ‘predatory’.  The problem with Ed Miliband is not his method of consuming a bacon sarnie – in fact I totally sympathise on that one. The problem is not even that he crashed the economy last time  though he did. He and Balls were at the controls in Downing Street when this country experienced the worst economic catastrophe in living memory – a catastrophe that was gravely exacerbated by their irresponsible fiscal policies.  The problem with Ed Miliband is that he wants to take the country back to the 1970s.  He genuinely thinks France is the model we should emulate  when the French – whatever the splendours of their civilisation – have 12 per cent unemployment  and when huge numbers of the most talented French people have decided that they wish France was more like Britain. How many Brits work in Paris? 16 000.   How many French men and women live and work in London? About 400 000. Mais oui. That should tell Miliband all he needs to know about the relative dynamism and competitiveness of the two economies.  Labour wants to go back to the 1970s  Ukip to some non-existent version of a monochrome 1950s  the Greens would like to go back to the middle of the stone age  and the Lib Dems would probably settle for any epoch in which they were above five per cent in the polls.   There is only one party presenting itself for election on May 7 that seems to believe in the genius of this country  and that has a plan to take it forward.  It is only the Conservatives that understand the real economic and social significance of all those British cars lined up at Bristol.   They aren’t the results of an evil and predatory system  by which workers are exploited and the boss class luxuriate in ever greater privilege.   They are the fruits of a long and painful post-war period in which Britain has learned that in order to survive we must innovate and compete  and that we cannot hope to compete if we over-tax and over-regulate in the way that Ed Miliband is proposing.  Those British-made vehicles are the sign of an economy that is back on its feet after the Labour-made disaster of 2008-9  in which motor manufacturing fell by half a million cars; an economy that has seen the creation  since 2010  of about two million jobs.  And those glistening British cars at the Bristol docks therefore embody the great moral purpose of wealth creation – because it is only if you have a strong and vibrant economy that you can hope to raise the tax to pay for roads and schools and hospitals and pensions and welfare – not to speak of strong defences – and all the other civilised objectives that we want to meet.  I really don’t think Miliband gets that.  He is one of those theoretical socialists who thinks the problem with socialism is it has never been properly tried; and I am horrified at the idea he should be given another go.  There is only one party presenting itself for election on May 7 that believes that on the whole today is better than yesterday  and tomorrow is going to be better than today. That is David Cameron and the Conservatives.  We need five more years to entrench this economic recovery  five years to take this country forwards and not backwards.  That is the Battle for Britain next month  and one this country can’t afford to lose.,HER,status

Omigosh. Can that be true? It says here that the legendary American zillionaire Mike Bloomberg is poised to make an entry into British politics. In fact  he is said to be toying with the job currently held by your columnist. Bloomberg for Mayor  they say – Mayor of London! What with one thing or another  I didn’t have time to ring Mike up and get to the bottom of it  not on Easter Sunday; but the story does not seem to be a complete invention.  Mike’s cause is being championed by no less a figure than Steve Hilton: remember him – the Cameron guru who pads around without any shoes on. Steve rightly admires the former New York mayor’s can-do spirit and astonishing record of achievement. So do many others  including me. Nowhere in the text is there what you might call a formal dementi from Bloomberg himself. My friends: there is only one conclusion. This is a test.  Someone  somewhere is mounting a Draft Bloomberg campaign  and they are sticking their fingers in the wind  testing the waters and generally running it up the flagpole to see who salutes. And I want you to know  therefore  that I am standing to attention and signalling my wholehearted approval. Mike  old friend  this is the big one. I had hoped that you would run for President  but you have mystifyingly decided to let that chance pass. There is therefore only one way to excel your epic 12-year career at the helm in Manhattan; there is only one great municipal job that could conceivably count as a promotion; there is only one way to graduate upwards from the position of Mayor of New York  and that is to become the leader of a city that has regained its status as the greatest on earth.  London was the first city since ancient Rome to have more than a million souls  and 100 years ago it was unquestionably the caput mundi  the centre of the biggest empire the world has ever seen.  In our lifetimes  alas  we have seen how it temporarily lost that crown. For much of the post-war period  few would have been so foolish as to rate London above New York. We lagged behind in dynamism  in entrepreneurial spirit  in sheer energy – not to mention GDP.  Today  however – well: it is clear that in many key respects it is London that now has the lead.  It is not just that the British capital still has the largest financial sector on earth  with probably about 320 000 people involved in one way or another. I read somewhere that there are more American banks established in London than there are in New York itself  and London does far more currency dealing. Britain’s capital now has a bigger tech sector  with about 528 000 people employed in all manner of start-up industries  and a creative sector expanding so fast that in the next 10 years we will probably make more TV and feature films than either New York or indeed Hollywood.  We have more museums and galleries than New York; we have more live music venues. We have more world-class universities in London than there are in New York – four of the world’s top 10. We have more World Heritage sites  twice as many bookshops  far more bars and pubs  and a much lower crime rate (the murder rate in London was last year the lowest since the Sixties  and less than a third of the rate in New York)  not to speak of wonderful taxi drivers who are obliged by law – unlike those in New York – to know where they are going; and a Tube network that is running ever faster and more efficiently; and if you add all these factors together you can see why people are so keen to come to our city.  Last year London hosted 18.6 million visitors from overseas  beating the record achieved in 2013. It is now the world’s number one destination for international tourists – and all the cash they bring – knocking Paris and New York off the pedestal. That is to the best of my knowledge the first time in recent history that London has come first in this fundamental criterion of global popularity.  So let me say to Mike: you have done the apprenticeship  and done it with great distinction. Now is the time to step up to the plate  and take on the fastest-growing and most dynamic urban economy in Europe.  You will  of course  find many friends here – and  indeed  with your work at the Serpentine Gallery and on other projects you already contribute hugely to London life  and you know how much we have in common. Both New York and London are cities that boast their diversity  with about 300 languages spoken in each. We constantly imitate and learn from one another  in a spirit of friendly rivalry. We have both put in bike-hire schemes (ours  I think  a couple of years ahead of yours); we both pursue strategies of urban greening; we are both battling to improve air quality. We are both struggling to cope with the problems of success – above all  to satisfy the demands of all who want to live and work here by building enough affordable housing.  Each city has an amazing future – according to all reputable analyses – as a powerhouse of wealth creation and innovation. But before you start your campaign  dear Mike  there is one cloud on the horizon  one way that London could go backwards to the Seventies  and that is if the people of this country are so mad as to elect Ed Miliband next month. Labour’s policies would damage our universities  by depriving them of vital revenue for investment in teaching. Labour would hit financial services and jeopardise the jobs of thousands who are by no means affluent; and above all a Labour government would pursue policies of taxation and regulation that are diametrically opposed to the spirit of enterprise that enable you to build your own empire.  It would be a great thing to enter the glass spheroid in Southwark and become Mayor of London  Mike. But first we need to ensure a sensible Conservative government on May 7.,HER,status

Well  folks  this is it  then. Monday is the day that the royal hands are kissed (not  I think  literally). The bomb-proof prime ministerial Jag will zoom back down the Mall and across the country thousands of relentlessly jovial parliamentary candidates – including your correspondent – will descend on the shell-shocked electorate in what they are all calling the most nail-biting  cliff-hanging  knife-edging photofinish of a campaign: the closest election of modern times.  As it happens  I agree strongly with the betting markets in thinking that the country  in the end  will get it right. People will see that there is a choice between a Conservative Party that has done an outstanding job of turning the economy round  delivering record employment  record numbers of new businesses  record apprenticeships – and a high-taxing  union-dominated Labour Party that would take this country back to the Seventies.  I think people see what we mean by one-nation Toryism: that it’s only if you encourage wealth creation that you can pay for the hospitals and the schools and the roads and all the support a civilised society must give to the poorest and neediest; and by May 7 people will have seen that Ed Miliband is a Left-wing egalitarian theoretician who has absolutely no interest in the culture of enterprise  aspiration and opportunity that this country needs – the culture that this Government has done so much to encourage.  Whatever the polls may say about the closeness of the race today  I reckon the public will take one look at the abyss and pull back.  In the meantime  though  I want to show you some of the horrors in that crevasse. There is one set of polling data that is now beyond doubt. There is one part of Britain where a seismic change has already taken place  and that is Scotland. In yesterday’s The Times  Damian McBride  Gordon Brown’s former spin doctor  wrote an excellent piece in which he analysed the Labour disaster north of the border.  Labour has basically given up the fight  he announced. They have moved through the cycle of grief  from denial to anger to depression to acceptance. They know that the gaps are so big that they are going to lose at least 20 seats to the Pisces of the political firmament – Salmond and Sturgeon.  It has taken some time for Westminster to grasp what this means for Britain. If Labour were to win an outright majority  they would need another 69 seats from all other parties; and no one thinks that is going to happen. If they lose 10 seats in Scotland  that pushes the required number of seats up to 79. If they lose 20  they need 89 – and so on. In other words  it is now becoming ever clearer that the only way Labour can govern this country is with the support of the Scottish National Party – and that is a prospect that is chilling the blood of sensible people across the UK.  I watched Nicola Sturgeon on television at the weekend  and the SNP leader was making no bones about it. She made a clear and unambiguous commitment to support and to work with a minority Labour government; as well she might  since she wants to reassure those huge numbers of Labour-SNP switchers in Glasgow and elsewhere that they can have their cake and eat it: a more Left-leaning government in the whole of the UK  and more independence for Scotland. And her promise  alas  is in one sense entirely plausible. Salmond at Westminster would run rings round Miliband  and in any kind of Labour-SNP coalition it is all too easy to see how the Scottish tail would wag the English dog.  The Scots Nats want to end and reverse all benefit reforms  even though these are supported by the New Labour faction in Miliband’s party and by the overwhelming majority of the British public. The SNP positively drool about the swingeing new taxes they could impose on the English  especially in London and the South East. They also want to scrap Trident – in defiance of most experienced and serious Labour MPs.  They would pursue policies  in other words  that would weaken Britain at home and abroad and  if he wanted to be prime minister  Miliband would have no choice but to bob along and agree. We would be consigning this country to five years of the most negative and regressive Left-wingery  larded with a ghastly finger-wagging political correctness.  In the end  though  the SNP agenda is subtler and more insidious. What do they really want? It’s there in the title. They want a new nation; they want independence. And to that end they will surely spend their time in government in a constant effort to tease  bait  goad and generally wind up the English until the patience snaps.  They will want five years of socialism in the UK  followed by another chance at breaking away. The risk is that by then the people of England will be so fed up with the moon-faced Salmond  with his sanctimony and sarcasm and beautifully judged air of injured innocence  that they will throw up their hands and consent – and we would incur the disaster that we thought we had averted last year.  The awful thing is that Labour in Scotland is already being forced to play along with this strategy: see Jim Murphy’s pathetic attempts to steal SNP clothes  bragging about tax raids on London and the South East in a way that has infuriated Labour in London.  It is no way to run a country  let alone to strengthen the union. The tragedy of Ed Miliband is that he can only govern this country by relying on a party that wants to destroy this country. There would be five years of socialism  and then a rupture that would appal the world. “Doubtful it stood ” says the sergeant describing the state of the battle at the beginning of Macbeth  “as two spent swimmers that do cling together / And choke their art.”  That is a perfect description of the state of Labour and the SNP in Scotland – and  if it were to come to it  in the country as a whole. They are locked in a deadly embrace  and the risk is that they will take the rest of us down with them.,HER,status
The thing about Lefties is that they need to be taken on. They need to be confronted with the facts of life – or else they will continue  in their Lefty way  to talk the most terrible nonsense. Let me give you an example of an interesting statistic that flies in the face of current Lefty rhetoric.  It is a huge truth about modern Britain that you will never hear from the lips of Ed Miliband or any other senior Labour figure. That is because it conflicts with their central “narrative”  namely that our society is becoming ever more unequal and unfair. Now  before we come to the fact in question  we must accept that the Lefty narrative – of widening inequality – is not wholly foolish or ill-founded.  It is a powerful story; it has  as they say  “traction” – and that is because there are some important respects in which  alas  it corresponds with reality. It is certainly the case that in many British companies and public bodies  the pay gap is at an all-time high. It is unquestionably true that in London and the South East the cost of housing is now a shocking and unprecedented multiple of average incomes. It is true that we need to address these imbalances. We need to level up low pay by expanding the living wage – and there are many companies that could frankly afford to pay more to their most junior staff.  We need to discourage the endless mutual back-scratching of the corporate “remuneration committees”  who always seem to discover that “market forces” mean they must regretfully pay each other colossal sums of money. We need to solve the housing crisis by building far more homes  and helping people’s deep and reasonable desire to get their own foot on the housing ladder. Yes  we need to help those on low incomes to buy  rent  or part-buy their homes.  Yes  we need to tackle those symptoms of inequality. But we also need to be able to take pride in our achievements  and the progress that society is making; and sometimes I find the general pessimism of the Lefties to be ludicrous and not a little nauseating.  Let me quote from a work by the late Tony Judt  a British historian based in New York  which I mistakenly bought at an airport bookstall. It is called Ill Fares The Land  and is drenched  front and back  with praise. It turns out poor Professor Judt was terminally ill when he wrote his book  and I am afraid he has allowed his suffering to affect his analysis. In his verdict on the current state of America and Britain  he speaks utter drivel.  Here is a typical paragraph: “Poverty – whether measured by infant mortality  access to medicine or regular employment or simple ability to purchase basic necessities – has increased steadily since the 1970s in the US  the UK and every country that has modelled its economy on their example. The pathologies of inequality and poverty – crime  alcoholism  violence and mental illness – have all multiplied commensurately. The symptoms of social dysfunction would have been immediately recognisable to our Edwardian forebears…”  Never mind that Judt has got it 100 per cent wrong in virtually every assertion; the whole sentiment is wrong. I remember this country in the Seventies  and I remember London in particular. It was poorer  greyer  drabber; it was the scene of really nasty and violent racism; the economy was in thrall to the unions; the food was terrible; and to say that it was somehow a safer place to live is  I am afraid  a complete and utter lie.  Crime is certainly an index of inequality  because crime hits the poor hardest. But by any measure  crime has fallen since the Seventies – in spite of a massive increase in the size and diversity of the population. Last year London suffered only 94 murders. That is not only an astonishingly low number for a city of 8.6 million (and less than a third of the murder rate in  say  New York). It is the lowest number of murders since the Sixties – and in a city with about two million more inhabitants than there were 40 years ago.  But it is in his remarks about life expectancy and the “pathologies of inequality” that Judt talks the most total tosh.  As it happens  life expectancy has increased massively since the Seventies  and indeed life expectancy in London has continued to increase in the last seven years – to pick a period entirely at random. In fact  the last figures I saw suggested that life expectancy has increased for both men and women by about 16 months  just since I have been mayor. There are parts of London where life expectancy is now more than 97 years.  But of course the capital also has pockets of poverty – four of the six poorest boroughs in the UK; and it is here that the statistics are most counter-intuitive. Who would you expect to be gaining the most in years? You might assume that it was the rich – gorging themselves on monkey glands and royal jelly  jetting off to America for blood transfusions. You would be wrong. Eight years ago the gap in life expectancy between Kensington and Chelsea on the one hand  and Barking and Dagenham on the other  was about six years; now it is about four years. Everybody is gaining in years – but it is the poor  proportionately  who are gaining the most.  No one knows the exact reasons  though we may speculate: better diet  better health education and health care  better air quality  and so on.  No one would want to be complacent. There is still a yawning gulf; there is still far more to do. But according to this fundamental criterion – of how long you are blessed with the ability to enjoy this life  how many glorious English springs you get to see – our society is actually getting not just absolutely richer in years  but fairer  more just  more equal – and therefore  in my view  better. That is a tremendous achievement  to be ranked up there with record employment and record growth.  We should shout it from the rooftops – because I don’t think we will hear much about it from the miserablists on the Left.,HER,status
Perhaps I shouldn’t care as much as I do. These victims aren’t real people  after all. They are just mouldering old statues  and they aren’t even statues of ordinary people. They are bizarre Assyrian gods. They have the bodies of bulls  with cloven feet and those peculiar ringleted beards in the shape of typewriters. No one believes in that religion any more  and the people who made the statues have been dead for thousands of years.  Who cares if someone attacks them with a digger? Who cares if they get a stick of jihadi dynamite up their sneering nostrils? Why the big fat fuss? And perhaps I am allowing myself to get a bit carried away when I hear about the destruction of the famous cities of Mesopotamia. I expect that some people will take the view that they are just a bunch of ruins. Most of the stone buildings have long since lost their roofs  and their real estate value is low. You could try to turn them into something useful  like a restaurant or a car park – but you wouldn’t get planning permission.  Who really minds if the Isil terrorists decide to flatten them? Most people would seem never to have heard of Nimrud  or Hatra or Nineveh. Most people apparently don’t give a monkeys about Ashurnasirpal or Tiglath-Pileser  or the fate of their imperial palaces. At least  I assume they don’t much care – because otherwise I simply cannot understand the sickening silence and complacency with which we are absorbing news of this tragedy.  There are all sorts of reasons why I loathe Islamic State (Isil). They commit crimes of hideous violence against living human beings – defenestrating gays  beheading minorities  raping women  and so on. But there is something about their assault on the history of the region – their moronic demolition of the past – that has filled me with a special blackness and despair. I am not a soldier. It is a long time since I was trained to use a .303 rifle or a general purpose machine gun. But if someone told me that they were forming an Antiquities Protection Force – a special brigade of pipe-puffing leather-elbowed history buffs and ancient monument fetishists  dedicated to repelling the attacks of the barbarians – I think I would be very tempted to sign up.  Whatever you may say about the appalling modern history of Iraq  the territory itself is the cradle of civilisation. This is where human beings first learnt to live in cities; this is where they came up with fired bricks  and paved streets. This is the civilisation that gave us the first types of writing. Here is not just the story of the Middle East; this is the story of the entire human race. The friezes of the Assyrians are astonishing in their intricacy and beauty – lion hunts  battles  massacres  farming  weddings. With their arrangements of horses in profile  they are the direct and obvious ancestors of the Greek bas-reliefs that launched our own Western artistic tradition.  Of course it is a disaster for the long-term future of Iraq and Syria – with their huge potential  in peacetime  for tourism – that they should suffer the destruction of these potential visitor attractions. But these artefacts and ruins do not belong to the people who happen now to claim sovereignty over these currently wretched deserts. They are the property of all mankind. What is the point of having a United Nations – what is the point of having any ability to project force overseas – if we do not come up with a way to safeguard our common heritage?  We are struggling at the moment to stop brainwashed young Britons from going out to fight for Isil  or to become “jihadi brides”. On Sunday the Turks succeeded in intercepting three deluded souls from the London area  and they will now come back to face the music. They will almost certainly be charged with preparing acts of terrorism – and rightly. But it has emerged in the past few days that a young Kurdish woman has also been charged with similar offences  even though she intended to go off and help the Peshmerga – the sworn opponents of Isil.  We can all see the difficulty here. We need to deter young people from going off to this hellish conflict  even if it means that the prohibition falls equally on those who have become radicalised jihadis  and on those who want to combat their mania. But I refuse to accept that there is a moral equivalence between the two sides. On the contrary: the Kurds more or less share our objectives  while Isil are nihilistic and barbarian and cruel beyond belief. Of course we are nervous of any more British involvement  other than the current air strikes and behind-the-scenes training. But then what are we doing to stop the destruction of the monuments? We need a strategy  and fast.  The potential for calamity is enormous – imagine what these people – Isil – could do to the great Roman ruins of Libya. The world may be on the verge of losing Leptis Magna. It makes me weep with fury even to think of it. I don’t care how we do it – whether we set up a UN Cultural Protection Force  or whether we now team up with the Americans  the French and every other nation that cares about the past. We cannot allow these people to smash our history  our common story. They must be defeated.  In the meantime let us give thanks again for the British Museum  and the extraordinary efforts of Austen Henry Layard in the 19th century. It was Layard who moved those lamassus – the huge bearded statues – from Nimrud to London  where they can be seen and enjoyed to this day. They are one of the glories of the museum  and if they hadn’t come to London they would now be smashed to smithereens by deranged Islamist ideologues. Think of that  next time you hear some Lefty complain that the Museum is full of stolen treasures. Britain saved those masterpieces  just as Elgin saved the marbles from the Ottoman lime kiln. Now we have to save the ancient cities from the greatest threat since the 13th-century Mongol hordes.,HER,status
The only way that poor old Ed Miliband can get into Downing Street is with the support of the SNP - a deal that would leave a weak Labour leader in the pocket of Alex Salmond.,HER,photo
I am more than usually bleary-eyed this morning  having spent a dark night of the soul. What kind of a Conservative am I  anyway  I asked myself  at about 3am  as the last chunderings and barrackings died away in the street. Am I a Hayekian free-market liberal?  Or am I a cultural conservative? A fox barked. A tin can rattled down the pavement – and sleep continued to elude me. I tossed and turned and grappled for the answer.  It all depends  you see  on your instinctive response to the planning policies of a certain Left-wing Labour council.  There is a chap I know who has just got married  and who wants to watch satellite television – cricket and so on. He needs to put a dish  an aerial  on the exterior wall of his flat. The Lefty council in question has told him that he may not do this  because in their snooty opinion the dish would be an eyesore.  There is  however  one way that he could secure the right to install the device. According to the letter from the council  they might show mercy if he could demonstrate that he had “social needs”. And what  he has asked the council  do they mean by “social needs”? Well  he has been told  he might need to watch programmes in a foreign language. He might be at risk of “social exclusion” unless he is able to watch a regular diet of Bangladeshi soaps or Turkish cookery shows or Blind Date in Serbo-Croat.  You mean to say  I asked my friend  that if you can prove that you have a “social need” to watch programmes in any language other than English  then you can go ahead and whack up the dish; and yet if you want to watch the Ashes  in English  you may not? That  said my friend  was about the size of it. And at this point I am afraid I saw red.  London is perhaps the most cosmopolitan city on earth; there are 300 languages spoken on the streets  and the recent waves of immigration have unquestionably added to the cultural and commercial dynamism of the capital. Of the 8.6 million people in London (and growing fast) 38 per cent were born abroad – probably the highest proportion since Roman times.  That is  I suppose  a tribute to London’s attractiveness as a place to live  and to the success of an economy that now contributes about a quarter of UK GDP. The question is: what sort of society do we want – a society that is integrated  or one that is balkanised? Do we let people live and work in mutually segregated sub-cultures? Or do we insist on the primacy of the English language?  My instinctive answer is clear. I think we should insist absolutely on English as the common language – though I can see that this immediately raises some ideological difficulties; and it was this conundrum that was causing my brain to race last night.  If you are a classical free-market liberal  you think that the state on the whole should butt out of things. You believe that people have a right to live their own lives  within the law. You think – along with J S Mill and others – that provided people are doing nothing to harm anyone else  they should be able to eat whatever food they like  wear whatever clothes they like  and speak whatever language they choose. Why should government go around telling people what language to speak? What business is it of the state?  A true free-marketeer might hold that individuals should be left to make their own choices  on the grounds that they are likely to be the best judges of their own interests. And when it comes to imposing a common language  we English-firsters must accept that there are inconsistencies in our approach. From Shanghai to Mumbai to Dubai  there are vast communities of British expats around the world – with large numbers unable to string together a sentence of Chinese or Hindi or Arabic.  How would they feel if they were told  in a finger-wagging way  that they had to speak the local language? They would say it was tyrannical  and bossy  and that they could manage very well with a few pidgin phrases. So what gives us  in Britain  the right to insist on the primacy of this country’s language  when Brits overseas face no such moral imperative?  That is the dilemma I wrestled with – and yet there are several reasons why I reject the libertarian approach. The first is that I feel – passionately and perhaps obscurely – that if people are going to benefit from this country’s lavish welfare state  they should at least make an effort to speak the national language.  With the help of an interpreter I was talking recently to a nice Turkish chap who wanted a different council house – his current one had too many stairs  he complained. He had been here for 15 years  it turned out. Fifteen years! English is not an especially difficult language. If he wants us to pay for his blooming house  he should at least get a grip on the lingo.  The next reason is of course that in many communities there are people – especially women – who are not able to take part in the economy because they simply don’t speak English well enough. That is why we have put more money into teaching English in London for “speakers of other languages”. Helping people to speak English is not so much an act of cultural imperialism as of economic liberation.  But the final reason why I think we should insist on English is unashamedly emotional  atavistic  and culturally conservative. This is our language  the language of Shakespeare  the King James Bible  the language that has been spoken in London for centuries; and in the face of the vast migratory influx we have seen  we must insist on English if we are to have any hope of eupeptic absorption and assimilation.  And it is therefore utterly insane that councils pursue television aerial policies that discriminate against those who want to watch programmes in English  and in favour of those who can now live in a foreign-language bubble. They should scrap that bias now.,HER,status
At first I couldn’t believe my ears. “Jihadi John” had finally been exposed as Mohammed Emwazi  and there on our screens was this knife-wielding assassin – a frame taken from one of those nauseating videos in which he swaggers and gloats and boasts about the ways in which he has subverted all decency and cut off the heads of a string of innocent aid workers and journalists. And there in the television studio was a man who seemed intent on exculpating the terrorist.  He was called Asim Qureshi  the “research director” of a body called “Cage”  and he was determined to blame absolutely everyone except the killer himself. When Jon Snow gently asked him to condemn the murders  he started babbling indignantly about the deeds of Tony Blair and Dick Cheney.  When pressed again  he accused the newsreader of Islamophobia. When Snow – who did an excellent job – asked him again to assign blame where it lay  fully and squarely with the ghoul in Syria  he started  incredibly  to blame the UK security services.  Yes  the brutal security services had stopped Emwazi from going to Tanzania “to make a life for himself abroad”. Make a life for himself! He was going to join a terrorist group called Al-Shabaab  and at one stage tried to force himself on board a plane. This sick young terrorist – said Qureshi – was “a beautiful man  very caring  very compassionate towards others”. Tell that to the relatives who have seen him publicly behead their loved ones.  It was one of the most vomit-making TV interviews I have ever seen  and at first I simply dismissed it. Surely no one would believe such rubbish; and then I reflected – and of course I saw that Cage and other apologists are by no means idiotic. You and I can see through their lies  but there are thousands  if not millions  who are more suggestible and who are willing to see things that way. The Cage people are pandering to a section of the audience that is frighteningly large  and growing. We need collectively to demolish their myths; and to do it fast.  We need a proper security response. We need to be able to monitor these vipers nursed at the breast of the British state: their movements  their communications  and sometimes we need to be able to separate them from others who could aid and abet their plans. In so far as the Lib Dems are still being obstructive  they must be overwhelmed.  Then I am afraid that we must accept that Isil still has the charisma that goes with military victory. They have money  oil  huge tracts of land – flats and material comforts with which to bait the deluded girls from Bethnal Green  who think they are going out to meet a religious and gun-toting version of Brad Pitt. We need to come up with a way of beating them – and given the understandable public revulsion at the thought of British boots on the ground  we need to work harder at backing the Kurdish Peshmerga  and persuading the Sunni military that it is in their interests not to collaborate with the terrorists  but to drive them out.  Yet none of these solutions will be any use unless we also change the way these people are sometimes viewed  and especially by young Muslims growing up in this country  whether in London schools or anywhere else. We need to debunk these jihadists and their phoney ideology. There is nothing pure or honourable in their barbaric subculture – of rape camps  throwing gays off cliffs and burning people alive in cages.  They are not even religious: many are said to have a very sketchy knowledge of the Koran. They are hopeless hypocrites who claim to despise the West but who pathetically wear Nike trainers and daub their temples with expensive Chanel cologne (Egoiste  appropriately  the preferred aroma). Many of them are losers: twits  twerps and misfits who are hopelessly caught up in a mobile-assisted pornography of violence.  Above all  we must stop this fateful elision – encouraged by the likes of Cage – between this jihadism and Islam. The other day I pointed out that many of these young men are – according to the security services – heavy users of porn. I was astounded to be denounced  on the front page of The Guardian  by the Muslim Council of Britain. A spokeswoman said that I was somehow attacking Muslims as a whole. Why on earth would she say that? Why is the MCB effectively claiming these porn freak jihadists for mainstream Islam?  I believe – and I certainly want to believe – that this jihadi madness is rejected by the overwhelming majority of Muslims; and yes  I was dismayed by the recent BBC poll in which 27 per cent said they had “some sympathy with the motives behind” the Charlie Hebdo shootings. But  then  there was no control sample of the rest of the non-Muslim population  and I am afraid that there are plenty of non-Muslims who found the cartoons offensive  and plenty of readers of this paper who object (rather more than I would  perhaps) to needless insults to religion.  I seem to remember that Pope Francis himself was asked what he thought of the motives behind the shootings  and said: “If you swear at my mother  expect a punch.” That would put him pretty firmly  I think  in the 27 per cent. The point is that neither he  nor Telegraph readers who disliked the Charlie Hebdo cartoons  nor the overwhelming majority of Muslims would want to see that emotion – taking offence – translated into violence of any kind.  That is why it is vital to insist  time and again  on the difference between this sick jihadism and Islam; and that is why  conversely  we must do everything we can to stop the likes of Cage – and indeed the MCB – from eliding anti-jihadism with Islamophobia. You can loathe jihadists  in other words  and be perfectly sympathetic to Muslims.  It is obscene  looking at their defence of Emwazi  to think that Cage have been taking money from charities such as the Anita Roddick Foundation and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. They should stop apologising for terror  and start apologising to the victims.,HER,status
I can’t imagine that anyone in his right mind would actually want to go to the 91st birthday party of Robert Gabriel Mugabe  which takes place this Saturday.  It promises to be an event of truly spectacular moral ugliness. While his people are starving  the ancient despot will convoke 20 000 cronies at a kind of golf club-cum-safari lodge near the Victoria Falls. In scenes reminiscent of the more disgusting and luxurious behaviour of the emperor Commodus  he will cause various exotic beasts to be slaughtered for the feast.  Five impalas will be roasted  two sables  two buffaloes – and then  to the ululations of his drunken Zanu-PF supporters  there will be a series of culinary climaxes  each more revolting than the last. A local farmer has procured two elephants  and after these rare and majestic creatures have been butchered for the delectation of the semi-deified Mugabe  there will be one more type of meat to come – an animal that you might think was semi-sacred  whose killing should be taboo  a creature that people would never normally dream of eating. Yes  a lion  the king of the animal kingdom  will lay down its life before the meat-maddened mob and have the honour of surrendering its mortal flesh to the palsied gullet of the man who still calls himself the “Hitler of Africa”.  And then  at last  the cake will appear  predicted to weigh 200lb  and in the most depraved and demoralising vignette of all  this crowd of brainwashed Zimbabweans will sweetly sing Happy Birthday to the man who has impoverished their country. This birthday party is predicted to cost $1 million at a time when Zimbabweans are living on 35 cents a day. Teachers across the country have been forced to contribute $10 each to put on the show.  The whole exercise is utterly nauseating – and my only question  as I say  is who on earth would want to be there?  Who is going to be toasting Mugabe in champagne and Tusker lager? Who is going to feature in the photo spread in the Zimbabwean equivalent of Hello! or OK!? I doubt that Britain will be represented at all – but by rights there is one man who damn well should be there  one man who should be down on the dance floor with Mugabe’s buxom assistants  and flashing his familiar glistering smile at the gathering.  If there were any justice in the world  that man would break off from giving advice to sundry other dubious regimes and help old Bob with the job of blowing out his candles. And that man  naturally  is Tony Blair.  Zimbabwe is now the second poorest nation on earth – beaten only by Congo for overall grimness. The people are so badly malnourished that one in three children is physically stunted  according to the UN. If you go there you see the ravages of HIV  the emaciated figures standing listlessly on street corners. Companies are constantly going to the wall.  But it is vital to recognise that Zimbabwe was not always like this  and did not have to be like this. This Mugabe tyranny is no accident – and Britain played a shameful part in the disaster. Readers will remember the 1979 Lancaster House Agreement  by which Margaret Thatcher granted independence to Rhodesia. At that time the country was a breadbasket  a flourishing agricultural producer  with about 6 000 commercial farmers. The only trouble with those farmers was that the most successful of them were white – and Mugabe’s long reign has been characterised by one overwhelming objective: to exterminate the last vestiges of white power  whether political or economic.  As he has said: “The white man is here as a second citizen. The only man you can trust is a dead white man.” So it was crucial that the Lancaster House Agreement protected the interests of these white farmers. They could  of course  be bought out  but their land could not be simply seized. There had to be a “willing buyer  willing seller”. The British government agreed to fund the arrangement  compensating the former colonial farmers for land that they gave up. Under that arrangement the white farmers were able to survive – more or less; Zimbabwe remained economically viable – more or less.  And then in 1997  along came Tony Blair and New Labour  and in a fit of avowed anti-colonialist fervour they unilaterally scrapped the arrangement. The overseas development minister  Clare Short  made it clear that neither she nor Blair gave a stuff about the former colonial farmers. As she put it at the time: “I should make it clear that we do not accept that Britain has a special responsibility to meet the costs of land purchase in Zimbabwe. We are a new government from diverse backgrounds  without links to former colonial interests. My own origins are Irish and  as you know  we were colonised not colonisers.”  May 1982: Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her husband Denis say goodbye to Robert Mugabe at Downing Street  It was that betrayal of Lancaster House that gave Mugabe his pretext to launch his pogroms against the whites. I remember going to a place called Mazowe  not far from Harare  where Mugabe now has one of his vast personal ranches. I met an old ex-Rhodesian couple whose family came from near London  whose kitchen dresser bore the medals their relatives had won fighting for this country. I remember them physically trembling with fear of the Zanu-PF thugs who were waiting at the gate to their farm; and it wasn’t long before they were gone – driven out by sheer intimidation. They died not long afterwards.  The Labour government enlisted this country in all sorts of wars around the world  some more disastrous than others. British soldiers went to fight and die in Iraq  in Afghanistan  in the Balkans. Here we had people with close relatives in our own country – yes  our own kith and kin – and we did absolutely nothing. We turned our backs on the very people who were actually indispensable to the economic well-being of Zimbabwe  and Labour essentially allowed Mugabe to launch a racist tyranny.  It was Labour’s betrayal of the Lancaster House Agreement – driven by political correctness and cowardice – that gave Mugabe the pretext for the despotic confiscations by which he has rewarded his supporters. And that is why Blair should be there: to mark Labour’s special contribution to the tyrant’s longevity in office.,HER,status
The great thing about Americans is that they get to the point. They don’t go for the delicate hint. Last week in Washington I was left in no doubt by a series of politicians – Democrats and Republicans alike – that they love Britain; they love coming to London; they believe as ardently as I do that there are values that unite Britain and America.  But when it comes to defending those values they believe there is more that we – the Brits – should be prepared to do. “Hey  you guys ” was the message I got  “we hope you don’t go all soft on us now.” They look at Vladimir Putin  and they are alarmed. They see him carving up Ukraine; they know that he is causing increasing anxiety in Russia’s near abroad  especially among the Baltic states. And this  they say  is no time to be cutting defence expenditure.  “You are our number one ally ” as one Congressman put it to me  “and we need you.” And  of course  I protested strongly: that we are there  that we always have been  and – at least as long as David Cameron is Prime Minister – that we always will be there. It was the Prime Minister who led the way at the recent Cardiff summit in committing Nato countries to spend 2 per cent of GDP on defence.  It was David Cameron – and not the White House – who was in the lead in calling for intervention in Syria in 2013; just as it was the Prime Minister who was instrumental in ending the massacre in Benghazi: the right thing to do  even if there has been an unhappy sequel. British Armed Forces have done a superb job in Sierra Leone  and generally in the struggle against ebola. You will find British troops deployed in dozens of countries around the world  and the Royal Navy on patrol everywhere from the horn of Africa to the Gulf to the Strait of Malacca to the Falklands to the Mediterranean.  We are still the fourth biggest military power in the world  we have the best special forces  and we have just invested £6 billion in two colossal new aircraft carriers. We are the one ally that has been with America – in spite of all our doubts and public protest – throughout the long and bitter engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan  and whatever else you may say about this country  you could not accuse us of lacking a historic martial spirit. It is not necessarily something to brag about  but it is nonetheless a fact that of the roughly 200 countries in the world today  Britain has at one time or other invaded or conquered 178 of them. The only people to escape are places like Luxembourg.  There is no other country that comes close to that record of belligerence; not the Americans  not the French  not even the Romans. These days  of course  we have not the slightest intention of invading or conquering anyone – not least after the unhappy experience of the Iraq war. All we want is to do our very considerable best to help keep the world safe; and our American friends are  of course  right to think that our defence budgets – like those around Europe – are under strain.  We face the increasing “juridification” of conflicts  with the MoD coughing up untold millions in ludicrous “compensation” to the many hundreds of jihadis who are using UK taxpayers’ money to sue the British Army for alleged breaches of their human rights.  The MoD must shoulder ever-growing costs in manpower  and defence budgets are by no means protected  or “ring-fenced”  like those of the NHS. All these problems are trivial  however  in comparison with the risk of a Labour government  and one led by the most left-wing leader since Michael Foot. For all his faults  Tony Blair correctly took the view that Britain is a great power  a moral force for good in the world  and one that must be ultimately capable of protecting those values by force. Ed Miliband has junked that tenet  along with the rest of Blairism.  It is now clear that if he were to govern at all – a prospect that seems less and less likely  but which cannot be dismissed – he would be kept in office by the votes of the SNP. Nicola Sturgeon  the leader of the Scottish National Party  has made it plain that her support is entirely conditional on one thing: that Labour gets rid of Trident. There would be no modernisation of our nuclear deterrent in 2016. Under Labour and the SNP  Britain would be denuding itself of its most important weapon; at the very moment when Putin is increasing his defence spending by 35 per cent  and building huge new drones capable of long-range bombing. How are we supposed  in those circumstances  to help the Americans face him down?  If a Labour-SNP coalition were to junk Trident  Britain would be vulnerable to nuclear blackmail; but it is worse than that. We would suffer a public and visible diminution of global authority; we would be sending a signal that we no longer wished to be taken seriously; that we were perfectly happy to abandon our seat on the UN Security Council to some suit from Brussels; that we were becoming a kind of military capon. Yes  the nukes are expensive – but so is all defence spending  these days.  The only way to fund the forces we need is to have a government that understands business  and produces sustained economic growth – and that cannot be Miliband. Our Armed Forces are not a luxury. They are indispensable to our lives. I remember how they rescued the position in the Olympic and Paralympic games – cheerfully helping with the security at the last minute. I have seen them stop London houses from being flooded  quickly and efficiently building sandbag fortifications.  But their role is much more important than that. As our American friends instinctively understand  it is the existence of strong and well-resourced British Armed Forces that gives this country the ability to express and affirm our values overseas: of freedom  democracy  tolerance  pluralism. David Cameron gets that. Ed Miliband would put it all at risk  and in the process he would make Britain weaker and less safe.,HER,status
I don’t think we can entirely hold it against Ed Balls and Ed Miliband that they have no experience whatever of the private sector.  They have never been responsible for the profits of a real live business. Neither of them has sat miserably as the finance director demands that nice old so-and-so be sacked in order to save costs.  They haven’t had to worry about weekly sales figures. They don’t know the desperate feeling that you have to innovate  the whole time  in order to fend off your rivals.  This pair’s lives have been funded and formed by taxpayers’ money. They have been cushioned and bowered exclusively by the state – but then they are hardly alone in that respect; and that is not why this nation’s businessmen are starting to view them with despair.  The reason even Lord Haskins is now turning against Labour is that everything they say or do seems redolent of a distaste for wealth creation  a suspicion of enterprise  and an absolute hatred of the profit motive.  It isn’t just the new taxes they want to impose on property  or the financial transaction tax  or the hikes in income tax. It’s the underlying mindset – the intellectual failure to grasp that the profit motive can be good; that it can be necessary; that capitalism is not just compatible with satisfying the wants of the poorest and neediest in our country – but essential if we are to meet the biggest challenges facing the human race. In fact  there are some sectors of the UK economy where we need to be more ambitious  more tycoon-like  more ready to build vast commercial empires: in short  to be more American in our outlook.  This week I am in Boston  home of the world’s biggest and most successful cluster of life sciences companies. The mission  as ever  is to tell the world what we are doing in London – and why our country is now the place to come and invest: the place to find the talent you need  the place to launch a start-up; the ideal partner in any international venture. We have a growing MedCity – an amazing constellation of scientific and healthcare institutions  which stretches along the Euston Road from King’s Cross in the east to Imperial College in the west.  This year we will see the opening of the Francis Crick institute  a vast structure that will house 1 500 scientists devoted to revealing the innermost secrets of human life: what really happens in our cells  and how they can be protected from disease. To assist them in their research  London boasts one of the largest and most trusted sets of medical data in the world – the anonymised records of the eight million people who use the NHS in the city. MedCity is a bustling cyclotron of talent – to borrow a metaphor from another scientific discipline – with people and ideas pinging off each other at an ever greater rate; and it is not surprising that there are the regular flashes of inspiration that produce the breakthroughs.  British scientists have led the way in the past 25 years in finding all sorts of therapies for cancer. It was a British scientist  for instance  who pioneered the use of monoclonal antibodies. Now the Brits are again in the lead  with an even more promising system for tackling the killer that has its invisible bullets streaking towards half the population. They are using T-cells – the antibody cells so called because they form in the thymus – to attack and destroy the cancerous cells. How? By highlighting them  as it were  with a fluorescent pen.  One of the reasons cancer is so nasty is that the cancerous cells have a stealth quality that somehow enables them to evade detection by the body’s natural immune system. The latest breakthroughs involve figuratively putting a beacon on those cells  and so allowing them to be zapped by the T-cells. You only have to think about this for a second to see its enormous potential for alleviating suffering.  We have grown used to cancer treatments that involve surgery  or chemotherapy – cutting or poisoning us in order to kill the mutants. Now we seem to be on the verge of enlisting our own legions of antibodies in the struggle. It is a heart-lifting prospect – and yet there is a curious feature of all these British advances: that as soon as they happen  their commercial potential is instantly snapped up by someone else  and that someone is usually American. As soon as the seedlings of an idea have taken firm root  as soon as they begin to bud or flower in Britain  it is as if a gigantic combine harvester has arrived to deracinate them and transplant them elsewhere. The result is that for all our ideas  we do not produce the same scale of businesses – and that means we are not producing the jobs and growth commensurate with our innovative genius.  All sorts of reasons are given for this  not least the historic failure of British science to think with the same sort of commercial energy as our transatlantic friends; and if that is so – and my friends in MedCity say it is – then the last thing we want is a political environment that is sneery and deprecating about the very idea of wealth creation.  It is a measure of our cultural triviality that we obsess about whether the Harrovian or the Etonian will win the Oscar or the Bafta  when the important point is that they are portraying two British scientists who changed the way we understand the world; and in the case of Alan Turing  paved the way for the very computer on which I am writing this article – but which is made by an American company whose collective sales have created the biggest cash mountain the world has ever seen.  You need capitalism to make these things. You need venture capital to cure cancer; you need people who are willing to wager huge stakes on the success of these therapies. And I am afraid those investors will always be fired not just by a desire to better the world  but by a good old-fashioned profit motive – and the last thing we need is a Labour government that fundamentally hates the idea of profit.,HER,status

This weekend we were all Parisians. While the Prime Minister and others joined the march in the French capital  other European cities staged rallies and events of all kinds. In Trafalgar Square we gathered to pay our respects to the dead of the past few days: to the heroic journalists who died for the right to express themselves; to the innocent victims of the kosher supermarket. In tribute to our sister capital  we illuminated the great buildings of central London with the Tricolore. “Je suis Charlie”  said countless signs. The people of London were sending a message of joint defiance  of shared values  of a refusal to give in to terror.  And yet we must be honest  and confess that in claiming the mantle of the editors and cartoonists of the French satirical magazine  we were being not only presumptuous  we were being pretentious and  I am afraid  simply inaccurate. There is hardly a paper in Britain that has followed the lead of Charlie Hebdo  and printed the offending cartoons of Mohammed. In fact  I cannot think of any mainstream media organisation that has been able to tell its viewers or readers what the fuss is all about.  You would have thought it was essential to the story. Appalling carnage has been inflicted; young men have been incited to commit acts of disgusting savagery; the French nation is in a state of shock and grief. And yet the British public is unable to form any kind of judgment about what exactly it is that is meant to have caused the offence. Was there something particularly rude or risqué about the drawings? Were they obscene? Was it just the fact of the depiction of the Prophet?  There have been offensive Western depictions of Mohammed at least since Giovanni da Modena in the 15th century  and even in Islamic art the image of the Prophet may be rare  but it’s far from unknown. We need to know what precisely Charlie Hebdo did to provoke such mindless hostility – and at the heart of the whole story there is a blank  a big white space. The British press is globally famed for its willingness to say anything to anyone  to tell truth to power  to hold up people’s private lives to hilarity and scorn. In this case  a great ox has stood upon our tongue.  There are some respectable reasons that may be advanced  of course  and we have heard them a lot over the past few days. No one likes to give unnecessary offence to any religion  or to any group of people. There are many acknowledged limits to freedom of speech today – many of which are enforced by the law. There are words that may not be used  or not in certain contexts. There are assertions that may not be made  or not without the risk of legal challenge. But it is very striking that we in the British media have been almost uniquely reluctant  in Europe  to elucidate our viewers and readers as to the images at the heart of the furore  and I am afraid that it is not just a question of politeness  or punctilio  or old-fashioned good manners. The main reason no one is running the cartoons is that they are afraid.  About 10 years ago  the whole Danish cartoon controversy blew up – and I remember distinctly concluding that I would never have published them in The Spectator  which I edited  not just because they were gratuitously inflammatory  but because I didn’t see how I could justify my decision to the widows and orphans of my staff  in the event of an attack on our offices (and I note that one of the German publications to use the Charlie Hebdo cartoons has just been fire-bombed).  It is essential to admit this element of fear (and several editors have been candid enough to do so)  because fear is a very bad and corrosive thing. Fear leads to anger. Fear leads to mistrust. Fear can make you irrational  and in the case of Islamist terrorism  the resulting fear can obviously encourage prejudice and division. Fear leads to hatred – and that is exactly what those terrorists hope to provoke. They want to see anti-Muslim marches of the kind that are now appearing in Germany; they want an anti-Muslim backlash; they want war; and it would be absolutely fatal if we were to allow ourselves to fall for it.  London was united in the aftermath of 7/7 – the terrible bombings that killed 52 people and injured 700 – because the Muslim communities of this country were able to show beyond doubt that the murders had not been done in their name. The same outpouring of feeling is happening now  and the same show of unity.  Many fine things have been said and done over the past few days  but some of the bravest words and deeds have come from Muslims. I think of the Muslim policeman  shot in cold blood as he lay on the pavement – try to watch that clip without weeping. I think of the Muslim shopworker  who helped hide some of the kosher supermarket customers in the cold store.  Across France  Britain and the rest of Europe  there are Muslim voices saying what needs to be said  like the Association of British Muslims – which issued a dignified and sensible statement  in which it not only condemned the killings in the strongest possible terms  but defended the right of Charlie Hebdo to publish the cartoons.  And my hero – the man who got straight to the point – was the Mayor of Rotterdam  Ahmed Aboutaleb  himself a Muslim. “If you don’t like freedom ” he told the Dutch nation’s potential jihadists  “then pack your bags and leave. There may be a place where you can be yourself  so be honest with yourself  and don’t kill innocent journalists. If you don’t like freedom  then f--- off.”  That is the voice of the Enlightenment  of Voltaire. We can and will protect this country against these jihadist thugs. We will bug them and monitor them and arrest them and prosecute them and jail them. But if we are going to win the struggle for the minds of these young people  then that is the kind of voice we need to hear – and it needs above all to be a Muslim voice.  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/11338796/The-Islamists-want-war-but-it-would-be-fatal-if-we-fell-for-it.html,HER,status
This morning's appalling attack in Paris is a sickening assault on innocent Parisians and on the whole idea of freedom of speech. My thoughts and those of all Londoners will be with the victims and their families and all the staff at Charlie Hebdo.   It is incredibly important that we defend the freedom of expression that is the cornerstone of democratic society  and that we continue to face down this appalling scourge.  It reminds us that this twisted ideology of hate  often fostered elsewhere  now threatens the fabric of cities across Western Europe.  We can not and will never be complacent but Londoners should feel reassured that our city is protected by the best police service anywhere in the world. I urge everyone to go about their business as usual but to remain  as Londoners always do  vigilant and alert.   On behalf of the people of London I wish to send my deepest sympathies to the people of Paris. We stand together with you on this impossibly  difficult day.,HER,status
I am jiggling my toes and blowing on my fingers – and I am contemplating the eternal dilemma of inadequate infrastructure. That is to say  our boiler – after more than 14 years of roaring combustion – has conked. Its fires have died.  I need to invest in something new. The question is how much is it going to cost  and the answer is …What?! You cannot be serious. And that is exactly the dilemma we face in Britain today  as we consider the needs of the fastest-growing economy in Europe.  Take London  now responsible for almost 25 per cent of UK GDP. The population is about to reach an all-time high of 8.6 million  and is projected to hit 10 million by 2030. You may ask: is that a good thing? Is growth in itself a good thing? What if it just means more frenzy and more traffic  more people being fed abjectly into the maw of an overcrowded public transport system?  Surely we should care not just about national GDP – though obviously that is a matter of growing pride – but about quality of life: how much time we have at the end of the day  how much time to play with the kids  to read  to think  to relax  to be proper human beings.  Of course  we could just muddle on: we could rely on the upgrades of the old Victorian Tube  and the introduction of Crossrail – itself a scheme that is now 40 years old. Or else we could see the sense of what my friend the plumber says: that sometimes you need to go for the next big investment.  It is time for British cities to grow up  to be given more responsibilities for the taxes they yield – and to plan and build the infrastructure they need. We can patch up our roads and our rail; we can make do and mend – but unless we unlock local financing of long-term infrastructure  the system will one day seize up like a poor old put-upon boiler.,HER,link

Ah  the great figures of the ancient Roman world. Where would they fit into modern Britain?  Where Pliny the Younger takes an upbeat view of the empire  Tacitus is cynical  mordant. He is definitely a glass-half-empty sort.  Channel Four recently sent a reporter to cover the story of the Cereal Killer Café in Shoreditch – and he generally monstered the poor entrepreneurs. He was scathing about charging £2.50 minimum for a bowl of cereal; he mocked the proprietors – a gentle pair of bearded hipsters – for their pretensions to gentrify the area  and suggested that local people would not be able to eat there. He put the boot in  and I am not at all sure he was right to do so.  We should be hailing anyone who starts a business in this country; we should acclaim them for overcoming all the obstacles that government puts in their path. We don’t need taxpayer-funded journalists endlessly bashing the wealth-creators of this country  and sometimes we need to be a little less cynical and a bit more encouraging.  Tacitean scorn is all very well; but there are times when we should be boosting our enterprise culture. When someone has come up with a wacky business proposition that will create jobs and bring in tax revenue and boost the neighbourhood – send Pliny to cover it.,HER,link
The idea of sending a piece of the Elgin Marbles to Russia did not need to be cleared by government. The British Museum did not obtain prior government approval – and in that simple fact you have the difference between Britain and so many other countries on earth  and especially Russia. This is not a tyranny. We do not have power located in one place. We have and we protect an idea of cultural  artistic and intellectual freedom – and that is of immense economic value to this country.  Can you imagine any other country where a national museum could take such a politically charged decision  without government knowledge and acquiescence? Greece? France? Russia? Don’t make me laugh. That is why good old George Clooney is so wrong in his plan to restore the marbles to the “Pantheon”  as he puts it.  It is the British Museum’s freedom to loan Ilissus to Russia – even in this wretched period – that shows exactly why the Elgin Marbles belong and shall remain in London.,HER,link

Of course I am sad for the poor test pilot  and I am sad for dear Richard Branson – a genuinely amazing entrepreneur.  But if free–market capitalism is capable of sending a rich person to space  then it can surely do a little bit more to help those at the bottom of the economic ladder. In many sectors of the UK economy – and not just in banking – we have seen the growth of "top people's pay" outstrip the rest of the market.  All kinds of good reasons will be advanced for this: the need to reward talent  to remain competitive in a global market etc. But there is absolutely no reason why prosperous firms should not simultaneously give a little bit more to their lowest–paid employees.

Across the entire country Ed Miliband has lost touch with moderate Labour. And despite being the most Left-wing Labour leader since Michael Foot he can’t even stir the blood of the radical Left.   Russell Brand may be about as convincing as a political theorist as a toaster made by Russell Hobbs  but he is at least engaging his Left-wing audience with something they can recognise as passion.  Alas  I don’t have the slightest confidence that he will run for Mayor of London. But I would be thrilled if he did. As a phenomenon he is a sign of the disintegration of the Left and the weakness of Ed Miliband  and he therefore needs every possible encouragement.,HER,link
The idea to create a gigantic free–trade zone between the EU and the US is not a threat: it is a sensational opportunity to break down the remaining barriers to trade with the country that already takes 17 per cent of our exports – the biggest single export destination for Britain  and will boost the British economy by about £10 billion per year.   This pact is a massive potential win for humanity – the closer economic union between two vast territories that share a tradition of democracy  free speech  pluralism: the Western values that are under threat in so many other parts of the world.

This is a great day for Britain and a fantastic day for British democracy.  The Scottish No settles the matter for this generation - for our times.  The country we love and grew up in will stay together - and like many people I feel an overwhelming sense of relief.  Where else in the world could you have an event like this without bloodshed? The debate in Scotland was fierce and rowdy  but it was fundamentally peaceful  informed and intelligent.  The staggering turn-out is a credit to both the Yes and the No campaigns.  I also pay tribute to David Cameron  whose steadiness and clarity was unquestionably important as the campaign came to a climax.  Now we need a period of general cooling-down and making-up.  We need to make sense of the promises made to the Scottish people - without making a nonsense of our parliament at Westminster.  We will need to make sure that Scottish MPs cannot vote on matters that apply exclusively to England.  We also need to continue the process begun under this government of the devolution of more powers in England  and an end to the basic unfairness of the current settlement. What is sauce for the goose must be sauce for the gander.  There can be no going back to the hopeless regional English assemblies of the Blair government.  I am very pleased that the Prime Minister has identified one of the best and most elegant solutions - greater fiscal devolution for the great cities of England  London included.

The fight will be long and challenging  but I have no doubt that together we can return David Cameron to Downing Street as the Prime Minister of a majority Conservative Government.,HER,status

Evening folks.   Yesterday you may have stumbled upon some of Labour's latest wheezes from one of their possible candidates to be London Mayor.  Their latest suggestions would simply increase the cost of living for asset rich but cash poor hard working Londoners. It isn't an old person's fault that the value of her home she has been living in throughout her life has now risen astronomically. Her income hasn't increased  just the value of the home has.   Instead of hitting Londoners with more taxes - increasing council taxes and a tax on homes - a far better solution would be to devolve stamp duty land tax to London to fund the increase in housing supply we are planning for.  Rent controls don't work - as evidence from abroad shows  they drive away investment and reduce the quantity and quality of housing stock. And where Labour councils in London have introduced a compulsory landlord accreditation scheme we've seen the cost passed on to hard working Londoners - up to £200. The voluntary London Rental Standard I've introduced as Mayor is the best way to ensure renters get good quality service.  Londoners will also remember the Labour Mayor Ken Livingstone's similarly relaxed attitude to the greenbelt - thousands of gardens were classified as brownfield space and used for new build projects. I have introduced protection against garden grabbing  and pledged to keep the greenbelt. We have identified 32 Opportunity Areas on existing brownfield land where we can build the houses we need whilst protecting London's green spaces  a vital part of our quality of life.  Whilst Labour talk as though they led a golden era  let us look at the facts and the evidence will speak for itself.  Enjoy the weekend.,HER,status
It is one of the most shameful consequences of our failure to provide more hub capacity that Amsterdam now serves more UK destinations than Heathrow itself not to mention that Britain is haemorrhaging vital connectivity to growth markets across the world. If we cannot connect swiftly to these markets  we will lose exports  and opportunities  and eventually we will lose our position as a great trading nation. The country needs not a third runway at Heathrow  but proper hub capacity of the kind that every single one of our competitors has now built or is building.   This year for the first time Dubai is overtaking Heathrow as the world's busiest airport  and about a third of that country's GDP now comes from aviation. We need the scale and ambition to compete  and Heathrow is no answer.,HER,link

I think we've danced around it an awfully long time now  and as you know the Prime Minister ages ago said he would welcome me back - very kind of him to say so  - and has also been pretty clear that I can't endlessly go on dodging these questions as I've tried to do.   So  let me put it this way - I have not got any particular seat lined up but I do think in all probability - since you can't do these things furtively  I might as well be absolutely clear - in all probability I will try to find somewhere to stand in 2015.   It's highly likely I will be unsuccessful in that venture. You should never underestimate the possibility of things going badly wrong but I will try.   But one thing that is absolutely clear  I will serve out my mandate as Mayor of London and continue to deliver the best for London.,HER,status
Today is a very moving day as the country marks 100 years since Britain joined World War One. Below are some words which I gave in a speech earlier today:  One hundred years ago this month the guns of August roared into life across Europe  at the height of a summer every bit as fine as the one we enjoy today; and in London the mood of many people was frankly one of elation.   There were queues at recruiting offices as men signed up. The cause seemed so clear to them  as they got their papers and their uniforms. There was aggression to be repelled. There was honour to be won  in going to the rescue of embattled nations.   They had no inkling of the carnage that was to come. No one who helped inaugurate that war understood that humanity had entered an asymmetric moment in the evolution of weapons  when nothing had been devised that could protect live flesh from bullets and bombs and shells and gas.   Those volunteers did not know that they were signing up for a new era of mechanised and industrialised slaughter  or that the battle would become so fierce and so deadlocked that on some days  when the wind was in the right direction  the people of South East London could hear the gunfire in Flanders.   And no one could then foresee that even when that conflict ended the peace would be handled so badly that there would ineluctably follow - only 22 years later - a second world war  between the same nations  that was to be even more violent and murderous than the first.   No politician could conceivably have wanted that war to go ahead  in August 1914  if they had known what was to come.   So when we look back at all that innocence and folly – and when we look at the world in 2014 – it is surely obvious that we have no right to presume to any superior wisdom today.   That is why it is so vital that we remember those who lost their lives  their bravery and their sacrifice.,HER,status
Ed Miliband is absolutely right to say that politics should be about ideas  and he is right to say that these should be more important than image.  But the awful fact is that  frankly  Miliband's image and photo-opportunities are the best things he has in his political programme.,HER,link
There is only one reason why those drunken Russian-backed separatists had access to a Buk surface-to-air missile. It was a present from Vladimir in the Kremlin. He has set on this conflict. He is fanning the flames of violence in a sovereign European state. This is his war. He bears responsibility  and he must not be allowed to get away with it. If he wants to prevent the reputation of Russia from being deeply and globally tainted  he must act fast: to secure the site for a proper international inquiry  to accept the truth of what has happened  and to cut off the rebels from further supplies.,HER,link
In memory of those who died on 7/7 2005  and on behalf of all Londoners  we will never forget you  and this city will never give in to those who try and divide us.,HER,status
Perched above my desk is an old vuvuzela from 2010  painted in the white and red England flag  to remind me forever of that disastrous South African campaign. All these items were bought at that terrible moment in the four-year cycle when some gland beneath the brain squirts the toxin of hope. Time after time I have dared to dream that football might indeed be coming home. Like millions of others  I have laid on stocks of Doritos and beer and I have sat with my heart bicycle-pumped to bursting – only for England to squash it flat. Sooner or later  I reason  our luck must change. And it never does.,HER,link
It would be wrong and self–defeating to conclude that because we were wrong over Iraq  we must always be wrong to try to make the world a better place.   But we cannot make this case – for an active Britain that is engaged with the world – unless we are at least honest about our failures. ,HER,link

I am feeling a bit wrung out because I have just got back from the battlefield – I mean the zone of moral conflict that I now enter every time I open the door of the fridge.   I gazed at that full-fat extra-mature golden-skinned ingot of dairy-based destruction with the hopeless lust of the hobbit as he gazes at the Ring of Power  or a bishop unexpectedly opening the door of a brothel.   With a gasp I tore my eyes away. I slammed the door shut  and having eaten an apple in two ravening bites I am here to tell you that this time it is different. This time I have found an entirely new way of losing weight  and on this occasion I am not relying on conventional dieting willpower; or to be more precise  I am not relying solely on my ability to act rationally in my own self-interest.   From now on  folks  it is not just about me. It is about us.,HER,link
This European election is an expression of revulsion and discontent and it is a mandate for reform.

After using the Tube this morning  I spoke to commuters and the media to apologise to all those who have had a difficult trip into work or who have in any way been inconvenienced by what is happening today.  I also thanked the large numbers of London Underground workers who have come in and are helping run a very sizable chunk of the system.  TfL is running a record number of buses and a greater service on the Tube in comparison to the last strike. Please do visit http://www.tfl.gov.uk/ before you travel.   As I also said this morning  the RMT's strike is both bonkers and pointless and I continue to urge the Union to resume the talks.  Together we can make the Tube even better to reflect the needs of modern London and fare payers.,HER,link
RMT leadership about to show utter contempt for hard working Londoners  commuters and businesses alike by striking over tube modernisation  AGAIN! Three other unions are NOT striking. Just 30% of RMT members voted to strike!  Less than 3% of journeys now start at a ticket office. LU has made it very clear - no one who wants a job with LU will be in danger  no one is losing pay  there will be no compulsory redundancies  and there will be more staff not less out on the concourses and platforms rather than stuck behind a glass screen. And the £50 million of savings will help to keep fares down.  And yet the RMT remain hell bent on this pointless strike.,HER,status
I'm shocked. Bob Crow was a fighter and a man of character. Whatever our political differences  and there were many  this is tragic news.   Bob fought tirelessly for his beliefs and for his members.

I apologise to all my libertarian chums: I am afraid on this one I am firmly with the bossyboots brigade. Ban smoking with children in the car.,HER,link

Address to the Mexican Council of International Affairs: Ladies and Gentlemen  it’s a pleasure to be here in Mexico. I’ve been here once before and have wanted to come back for some time  so it’s great to be here in this vibrant and energetic city.  I’m looking forward to my first meeting with President Peña Nieto later today.  And I’m pleased to be leading a delegation of some of New Zealand’s most innovative businesses  which are keen to strengthen their ties with their counterparts here.  This visit comes when New Zealand and Mexico are marking 40 years of diplomatic relations.  It’s a good time to reflect on what we have achieved together  and to focus on what we can do more of in the future.  There is certainly plenty of room to grow our already broad relationship  given our history of close cooperation in trade and multi-lateral issues.  We share similar views in many areas  from the big foreign policy challenges confronting us at the UN  through to our excellent relationship at the World Trade Organisation in Geneva  and the OECD in Paris.  We in New Zealand also welcome your leadership in this region  and through forums like the G20 and APEC.  Your joining the Trans Pacific Partnership negotiations last year was enthusiastically received by New Zealand  and we were pleased to host you at the last round of negotiations in Auckland in December.

There is no going back.We have the opportunity to lead our country into this new chapter in our journey.  Not by seeking to impose our will. Or by berating those who disagree with us.

More on Nicola's call for a halt to Tory welfare changes. ,HER,link
I am calling on the UK government to put the roll-out of the controversial Universal Credit scheme on hold in Scotland pending the discussion about more powers for the Scottish Parliament. In my view  the Westminster parties' proposals on the devolution of welfare powers are far too timid. However  it is hard to see how even their limited proposal to devolve housing benefit can be delivered if the UK government presses ahead with UC  given that it effectively abolishes housing benefit. You can't have a serious discussion about devolving control of a benefit that is in the process of being abolished.  Westminster needs to respect the more powers process in both deeds and words. ,HER,link

Nicola spoke to Buzzfeed this week to mark one month to go until the referendum and highlighted the opportunities of a Yes vote:  “This is a massive opportunity for us in Scotland to take our future into our own hands. We’re one of the richest countries in the world  richer per head of population than the UK as whole  richer than France and Japan. The opportunity we have here is to use our wealth to benefit more people in Scotland  to put investment in childcare over investment in nuclear weapons.”,HER,link

Pensions are more affordable in an independent Scotland.

The Fine Gael members of the Cabinet met this morning to review the general election.  Despite the disappointing outcome of the election  which did not return the outgoing Fine Gael – Labour Government  Fine Gael will be the largest group in the new Dáil and we are determined to play our part in providing the Irish people with a Government committed to working on their behalf.  We will engage fully and inclusively with other parties  groups and independent deputies to ensure that such a Government is established.  Following our meeting today  we will continue our internal party discussions with the incoming Fine Gael Parliamentary Party on Thursday. In consultation with our elected representatives  we will formulate a set of principles that will guide Fine Gael participation in a future government. These principles will take account of the issues of concern that were highlighted and prioritised by the Irish people during the election campaign.  We look forward to discussing these and other ideas with the other parties and groups in a new Dáil that reflects the changed circumstances following the election.,HER,status
To all our supporters; For your hard work over the last few weeks- simply- thank you #ge16,HER,status
Tomorrow is your General Election.  You might still be undecided about which way you're going to vote.   And I understand that.  I remember in my first speech as Taoiseach I spoke about how a wound heals from the edges in.  And immediately we began that healing process in our country  together.  We faced choices that no government before us has had to make. And I hope no government will ever have to make again.  Over the past 5 years Ireland has gone from a bankrupt economy to the fastest growing economy in the EU.  It’s a journey that is unique to Ireland. Greece  Spain and Portugal were all in the same boat as us 5 years ago. But the big difference is - they’re still in that boat  as a result of electing unstable governments or because of indecisive election results.  I know what you lost. I know how hard you’ve worked. I know you can’t go back.  And I understand that many of you reading this do not yet feel the recovery in your own lives.  I am as impatient as everyone else for the benefits of recovery to be felt by everyone  in every home  in every community in every corner of our country.    And as we look to the next five years  I know we have it in our grasp to make Ireland a country where you can once again prosper  go to work  start a business  raise a family and grow old with dignity.  That is my ambition for you.   Tomorrow is a really important day for our country and maybe the most important ever. Don't put the progress we are making at risk.  Tomorrow  as you go to make your mark  Ireland's future lies in your hands.  I’m asking you to vote for Fine Gael.  Enda,HER,status

By 2020 we expect 70 000 Irish emigrants to have come home to take up new jobs and build their future.  What they carry home with them… their experience and knowledge and confidence will be a huge boost to Irish business and the Irish economy.

I know that the last few budgets have been hard  but they made it possible for us to exit the bailout  reduce our debts  and move into a real recovery.  The top priority of this year’s budget is to keep that recovery going  while providing relief and better services for the Irish people.  Today we announced cuts in the USC  which will give people a little more money in their pay packet.  We are also employing more nurses and doctors for the health service; introducing more affordable and quality childcare and we are ending the unfair treatment of the self-employed in this country.  These are sensible  affordable steps that will keep the recovery going and bring its benefits to you  your family and friends.  This is in stark contrast to the alternative fantasy economics of those in opposition who wrecked the economy in the past or those who would surely wreck it in the future  if we let them.  I need your ongoing support and help in explaining to people how this Government can be trusted to continue managing the economy in a way that will keep the recovery going and bring its benefits to more households.,HER,photo

#MacGill15  As I said on my first day as Taoiseach  the trauma people suffered during the crisis damaged us not alone economically and psychologically but at the level of the soul  the spirit  the psyche.  At the next election  the people will choose.  Will they choose the road to strengthened economic recovery - already mapped  cleared  tested?   Or will they take another road?  A road that’s possibly mined  and certainly unmapped  untested?  One that ignores their sacrifice  that gambles the recovery  that squanders their painstakingly-won security?  Will it be ‘Hello again’ to the old boom and bust  to the forced emigration of our children  to political and societal slash and burn  to the talented generations silo-ed into welfare  to the old political peep show with nothing to see but the impoverishment of its customer?  Or will it be a political freakshow  a government free-for-all  where it’s none for all and all for none?  Or will it be jobs  stability  caution; a plan that’s tested and proven; a plan that brings incremental prosperity; building  step by step  on the tangible developments  on the quantifiable improvements that at long last are starting to take hold across Ireland?  At the crossroads  that is the choice Irish people face.   Share if you choose the road to recovery already mapped  cleared  tested http://goo.gl/ZjK0qv,HER,status

As Taoiseach and as a proud Irishman I’m ambitious not only for my country but for our Union.    I’m determined Ireland’s success-story will be Europe’s success-story.

Home to an Ireland restored renewed economically.  But equally an Ireland convinced confident  that its true abiding value is alive sacrosanct in the proud territory of our people in the transforming currency of the Irish heart  imagination  soul.  Our peaceful Europe rose from the ashes of war. One of Germany’s noble laureates  Heinrich Bohl wrote of an Ireland before the European Union in his wonderful book Irisches Tagebuch.    One of Ireland’s Nobel laureates Seamus Heaney wrote in his famous poem written to mark the enlargement of the European Union – Beacons at Bealtaine – of Fionn Uisce  of clear waters that will flow from courageous leadership.  Leading to a prosperous Europe  built on hope  heart  diversity  respect  generosity   love.  That would be our true ‘Victory’.

I wish to announce for the information of the House that the Government has finalised the wording of a constitutional amendment on the protection of children and has decided to hold a referendum on this important issue on Saturday 10 November next.

Xtralis decided to establish its global headquarters in Ireland because it recognised our pro-business environment  our talented workforce and the determination of this government to create the climate for enterprise to flourish.

I believe it is imperative that we harness our strengths to grab the opportunities that our natural resources have granted us.  Over the past year I have met some fantastic innovative small Irish businesses based up and down the Atlantic seaboard who are developing new technologies to better harness renewable energy.

I would like to take this opportunity to wish Team Ireland  athletes  coaches  mentors  every success at the London 2012 Paralympic Games.  To represent your country is a wonderful honour and a tremendous personal achievement. Competing at Olympic level requires commitment  dedication  discipline  sacrifice and a lot of hard work. The training regimes of participants have ensured that they have qualified to compete in London and I want to congratulate each and every one of them as they represent Ireland in the coming days.

In recent days  I have been thinking a lot about Michael Collins. Wondering about his private thoughts  his personal preoccupations  on those lonely  and lonelier journeys by mail boat and train to and from London. A young man with a young man’s hopes and dreams  but with the destiny of a nation on his shoulders. Ireland and its possibilities took not just his life  but his youthful attention his very youth itself .  Therefore  as a man  a politician  blessed enough to reach almost double his age  I feel privileged  honoured to be invited here to Beal na mBlath to give this oration.  https://www.finegael.ie/in-focus/,HER,link

Someone let some puppies loose in the office.  Puppies are obviously insanely cute (and these ones are part of an animal adoption program) but  sadly  not all puppies get the happy life they deserve.  We recently instigated a parliamentary inquiry into animal breeding practices in NSW. Today we announced that we will be reviewing penalties and enforcement measures to ensure that dodgy operators can be dealt with seriously and shut down where necessary. It is simply unacceptable for people to be treating puppies or other animals in a cruel manner in an attempt to make a quick buck. We need to act and we will.  Oh – one of my staff  Nigel  wanted to take one of these puppies home for his birthday. Negotiations are still ongoing with his wife. Come on  Kate… let him keep one.,HER,photo
29 years ago on Valentine's Day I had my first date with Kerryn. She's been by my side ever since.

Let’s start with a statistic about Sydney’s nightlife that matters: alcohol related assaults have decreased by 42.2 per cent in the CBD since we introduced the “lock-out laws”.   And they’re down by over 60 per cent in Kings Cross.    But… didn’t we achieve this by shutting down the whole city and killing its nightlife?   Well  one last statistic: the number of small bars in Sydney has more than doubled in the same time period.   There has been a growing hysteria this week about nightlife in Sydney.   The main complaints seem to be that you can’t drink till dawn any more and you can’t impulse-buy a bottle of white after 10pm.    I understand that this presents an inconvenience. Some say this makes us an international embarrassment.   Except  assaults are down by 42.2 per cent.  And there is nothing embarrassing about that.   From the outset  these laws have been about fixing a serious problem. Violence had spiralled out of control  people were literally being punched to death in the city  and there were city streets too dangerous to stroll down on a Friday night. The community was rightly outraged. I was personally outraged. I met face to face with the families of victims. You don’t need to see that sort of pain too often to realise there is a problem that needs fixing. And the Government was determined to act.    We introduced laws to curb violence and to eliminate drinking ghettos by redistributing the nightlife across the city  making the whole city more vibrant.    Now  some have suggested these laws are really about moralising. They are right. These laws are about the moral obligation we have to protect innocent people from drunken violence.   Doctors right across the city are now telling us that they are seeing far less emergency room presentations on the weekends. Transport workers are telling us that the trains are safer. Small bars and restaurants are opening across Sydney. And residents across the city  particularly women  are telling us they feel safer walking home at night.    At this stage  some of the evidence is anecdotal. But lots of hard data is starting to come in. And it is all telling a similar story.   Over the coming months a detailed review into the effects of the lock-out laws will be undertaken. I await this work with interest. But as I’ve said before  it is going to take a lot for me to change my mind on a policy that is so clearly improving this city.  Now some  who wish to define our city by one street on Kings Cross  make the hysterical claim that Sydney is dead.  They couldn't be more wrong. This is the greatest city in the world and it is now safer and more vibrant than ever.   Long Live Sydney.,HER,status
When you were a kid  did you ever dream of having an invisible cloak?  Well  it turns out  it is not all it's cracked up to be.   Most days  as I walk in my suit down Martin Place  I am often warmly greeted by the good people of Sydney. "Good Morning  Premier!" (Along with some “constructive feedback” of course.)  Some stop to ask for selfies. No problem  there. I'm a politician. I'm not averse to selfies.  But today in Martin Place  there are very few greetings. In fact  most people lower their heads and hurry past me  desperate to avoid eye contact.   Today  instead of wearing my suit  I'm in a high vis yellow vest and red cap  selling The Big Issue.   The Big Issue isn't just a magazine... It's a great social enterprise designed to help our homeless and disadvantaged get back on their feet by doing some work.   One morning a year  for the past 6 years  I've hit the streets to try my hand at selling the magazine... and I'm struck every year by the same confronting reality of suddenly becoming invisible.   It isn't fun being invisible. In fact  it is really lonely.   I don't write this to make you feel bad. I've done it all too often myself. I've lowered my head instead of greeting my fellow humans with a smile. I've been too busy to stop. I've felt embarrassed. I’ve felt inconvenienced. Even annoyed.  Today is a reminder for me to slow down a little. To have time for everyone  regardless of their attire or status. And it's a reminder that our homeless shouldn't be invisible.   We’re spending a record $182 million this year on specialist homelessness services and are expecting to assist 54 000 people. We have a long way to go. But I'm determined to make a difference in the lives of our most vulnerable.   Thanks to the 11 people who stopped today to buy a copy of The Big Issue. And thanks also to those who just stopped to smile and say hello... Scotty  my mate who sells the Big Issue every week  really appreciates it.   He's a really good bloke who  along with many others  is trying to have a crack at getting back on his feet.  And he shouldn't be invisible.,HER,photo

We’re legalising Uber.  The digital revolution is disrupting and transforming the way business is done right across the world  and the taxi industry is a prime example.  The thing that has made the taxi/ride-share situation difficult to manage is that  unlike other businesses facing disruption (say  video stores facing disruption from Netflix) the government has sold and regulated taxi licence plates and has a responsibility to offer some protection for the mums and dads and investors who own these plates.  At the same time  we believe in innovation and we want the best outcome for consumers.   The solution we have come to basically boils down to this:  * Ride-sharing services will become legal   * Taxi licence plate owners will benefit from an adjustment package funded through both government funding and a short term levy on ride-sharing  * We are getting rid of over 50 cumbersome regulations  * Safety will be boosted through a new regulator and commissioner to oversee the industry  We are helping consumers to win through having more choice in how they travel and simultaneously being fair to taxi owners as they transition into the future.,HER,status
I will never forget what happened at Martin Place a year ago.  I will never forget Katrina and Tori.  And I will certainly never forget the response of this amazing city  as we came together with an outpouring of love and unity.  Nearly 50 years ago  Les Murray wrote a poem set in Martin Place. Its words resonate with me more than ever today. Here’s an excerpt.  ...... There's a fellow crying in Martin Place. They can't stop him.  The traffic in George Street is banked up for half a mile and drained of motion. The crowds are edgy with talk and more crowds come hurrying. Many run in the back streets which minutes ago were busy main streets  pointing There’s a fellow weeping down there. No one can stop him. ......  Today we weep  but also know that hope will triumph over hate.,HER,status
A year ago  in the face of evil  we saw a remarkable outpouring of love and compassion as flowers flooded Martin Place.  Today  we revealed the concept for the permanent memorial that will forever serve as a reminder of those we lost and the way this city came together in response.  In the face of division  we saw unity. In response to hate  we saw an overflow of peace and love.  We tragically lost Katrina and Tori. But we did not  and will not  lose the values that set us apart.  The memorial was designed by Richard Johnson and features hundreds of floral cubes inset into new granite paving right across Martin Place. At night they will illuminate to remind us that  when faced with darkness  this city responded with light.  The memorial also honours Katrina and Tori  who will live in our memories forever.   We will hold a twilight ceremony on Tuesday to mark the one-year anniversary of the siege. It will end with a lighting display on the Lindt Cafe  which will be repeated for five nights  and which movingly captures the spirit of this city one year go. It is also a reminder to the families of Katrina and Tori that we share in their grief and stand with them in their loss.,HER,photo

A message to all Novocastrians:  Last night  in the face of opposition from those who stand against progress  we took a huge step forward in our effort to transform Newcastle. Legislation was passed through the upper house that finally allows us to help Newcastle unlock its potential as one of the best cities in the world.  I love Newcastle. The beaches. The harbour. The people. But for too long  Newcastle has been held back from reaching its potential  with the same old issues being debated for decades. There's been lots of talk  but no action.   Those days are over.  I promised in the lead up to the election that we would not forget you and that we would keep our promises. And that is exactly what is happening.  Light rail is coming. And we are excited about cracking on and building it.  Revitalisation of the city is coming. Some of the best beaches in the world will soon be connected with one of the best harbours in the world.  Every time I visit Newcastle  I can feel the buzz. I can feel the optimism. The future is very bright and I’m excited to see the transformation of the city over the coming months and years.  I’d like to offer special thanks to Gladys Berejiklian and Bega (aka Andrew Constance MP) who have fought so hard for Newcastle and were instrumental in last night's result.   We can now push on with building the light rail  and the future  that Newcastle deserves.  In many ways the story of Newcastle is the story of NSW - promises are being delivered on  challenges are being overcome  potential is being unlocked  and an incredible transformation is underway.,HER,photo
HSC exams begin tomorrow.   Back when I was in school  a typical report card said something like "Mike talks too much in class."  Truth be told  I was much more interested in catching waves (and girls) than studying... and my HSC results were average at best.  Not too long after my school days were over  I met Kerryn on a beach down the south coast... And school was suddenly a distant memory!  Here's the truth of it... Life isn't defined by your exams. It begins after they are finished.   It's always important to give everything you do your very best shot  but make sure you keep some perspective. When you walk out of that final exam  you've got the world at your feet... And most of us oldies will tell you that your best days are yet to come.   Good luck guys.,HER,photo
We wake today with heavy hearts  and with shock at what we are learning about the shooting in Parramatta last night.   This weekend  as most of us enjoy football  family and sunshine  there is a family and a Police community who  instead  face a time of the deepest grief  pain and darkness.   Curtis Cheng went to work yesterday to serve his community through his job with the Police Force in Parramatta. An unthinkable act has ended his life.   We are told that the shooter was only 15 years old. The tragedy of this will echo around the world - that someone so young could commit this chilling act.   We don't yet know all the circumstances that led to this tragic event  but over the coming days the Police will work to investigate and determine what we can learn from it. We will get to the bottom of it. And we will act.   But for now  I want the family of Curtis and the members of his Police community to know that you don't face this loss alone. We mourn with you and we are here for you.   In stark contrast to one cowardly action  we have also seen the bravery of some our state's finest - Special Constables who acted swiftly to prevent this tragedy from becoming even worse. To them  and to everyone else who serves in the NSW Police Force  we offer our heartfelt thanks. Each day you put our safety before your own and we remain forever grateful for your service.   Finally  we cannot let actions like this divide us. We cannot let hate overtake us. This city and this state must remain united. We must stick together. And I’m certain that is exactly what we will see here in NSW.,HER,status

The NDIS shows what is achievable when we put politics aside and focus on doing what is right.   The rollout agreement I signed with Malcolm Turnbull today gives certainty to 140 000 people with disability in NSW.  I'd like to particularly acknowledge the vision of Julia Gillard  who introduced the original legislation for the NDIS and also Tony Abbott who was very committed to continuing the program in a totally bipartisan manner.   The essence of public life is being able to make decisions that help those who need it most. I was honoured to represent NSW today as we took the next step in one of the most important policy reforms in Australia's history.,HER,photo
Politics can be brutal.   What can be lost in the rough and tumble is the people  and the relationships.   I’ve known Tony Abbott for close to 15 years and I am proud to call him a mate. He will be hurting. So will his wonderful wife Margie and his girls. As their friend  I hurt with them.    Many of those throwing stones don’t see the heart behind the man who has spent decades volunteering at the local surf club or working a shift with the Rural Fire Service… not for political gain  but for the simple reason that he loves his community.   This desire to serve  mixed with a deep love of Australia  took him into politics  and ultimately to the highest elected office in the land. Not once have I sensed it was due to a thirst for power. Rather  he has an unquenchable desire to give back. This has always been grounded in a deep humility.   I do look forward to working closely with Malcolm. He will lead with distinction and I anticipate great things for Australia.   But right now  I say to Tony… thanks for always putting your hand up to serve. Thanks for loving your country.  And thanks for being a good mate.,HER,status
I am thrilled to hear that 12 000 Syrian refugees will soon be able to find safety on our shores  after the Prime Minister today announced a special increase on top of our normal annual refugee intake. I applaud this bold and generous decision.  What we’ve seen across our nation  and indeed the globe  over the past few days really does inspire hope in our humanity. When things seem to be at their very worst in the world  we often see the very best in people’s hearts.   Something is happening here in Australia. People have united behind the simple idea that our boundless plains are here to be shared  especially with those that are in desperate need.  There are now more displaced people in the world than at any other time in recorded history. Half of Syria’s entire population is currently homeless.  We are eager do more than our fair share to assist the Commonwealth Government as they respond to this crisis. And I am certain that people right across NSW will welcome our new Syrian neighbours with open arms and open hearts.,HER,status
Sometimes you can know all the facts and statistics surrounding an unfolding tragedy  but it somehow remains an intangible or external problem. A problem that is almost too hard to get your head around.   And then you see a photo. And somehow it changes everything.   I don’t know how you felt when you saw the image of 3 year old Aylan Kurdi lying lifeless  face down in the sands of a Turkish beach. I felt sick with overwhelming sorrow. And despair. And anger.   I turned away  but that image will never leave me. That photo isn’t just a story of one tragedy. It is the story of thousands of real people in a fight for life itself.   On one hand  none of this was new information. The crisis unfolding in Syria has been apparent for a while. The plight of the persecuted and the poor  seeking a better life in a different land  and the migration challenges that it brings to Europe and beyond… well  this has been well documented.   But that photo. That little boy.   I found that as the feeling of anger dulled  my next response was…. surely we can do more. But what is “more” and what does it look like?   The scourge of illegal people smuggling has been well covered  and I won’t rehash it all now. But I will say  it is a great thing that we don’t have children drowning at sea trying to get to our shores. That has been a significant humanitarian achievement.   But stopping the boats can’t be where this ends. It is surely where humanitarianism begins.    I have said in the past that not only are we a lucky country  we are a great country - and the thing that makes us great is our willingness to share our luck.   I am deeply encouraged by the Federal Coalition Government's commitment to increase our humanitarian intake over the coming years.   But I believe we should do even more. And we should do it now.   NSW remains ready and willing to do more than our fair share.    We cannot see the images we have seen  and feel the things we have felt  and then go back to business as usual.    Last week we saw that the NSW economy is the strongest in the nation. But that means absolutely nothing if we can’t use that economic strength to help the vulnerable both within and beyond our state boundaries.   Over the coming days I will be having discussions with the Federal Government to see what “more” looks like and how we can work together to act. I will assure the PM that he can count on NSW to do whatever is needed.   The unfolding tragedy has a long way to run but my hope is that these terrible events will bring out the best in humanity -- our humanity. In the meantime  my prayers remain with little Aylan’s family  with all those suffering persecution  and with our world leaders as they seek to address this growing crisis.,HER,status
A few words on Michael Clarke as he steps out onto The Oval tonight and leads Australia for the last time.  It’s easy for some to stand on the sidelines and throw their critical stones.  What isn’t easy is stepping out in the middle and facing the world’s best bowlers in the world’s toughest conditions.  Michael Clarke has been an outstanding cricketer.  His 28 Test Centuries and 13811 First Class runs speak for themselves. And no one will ever forget his majestic 329 not out or staring down the best fast bowling in the world in South Africa to score one of the gutsiest hundreds of all time.  However  the moment I saw the true leadership strength of Michael Clarke didn’t come on the cricket field. It came as he led his team  and indeed the nation  through our grief at the loss of Phillip Hughes.  We all felt the pain but Michael  through his strength and words in Macksville  paid respect to Phil and his family and  at the same time  lifted the nation. I won’t forget the way he led us during those tough days. It was a defining moment for our country.  As he dons the baggy green for the last time  I want to thank him for his contribution to cricket in this state  and this country  and to wish him the best.  I hope you go out and smash those poms around one last time  Clarkey. Nothing can be sweeter than going out with one final victory over England.  Well played  mate.,HER,photo

Let’s talk about the shark situation.  As a surfer  I’ve watched the recent shark events on the North Coast and I’ve felt them very personally.   The North Coast has some of the most beautiful  and at times fearsome  waves in the world. I have enjoyed surfing them many times myself and often marvelled how lucky we are to live in a country like this.  A while back  I even had a shark encounter near Crescent Head and  while I was lucky to escape  I should note that my best mate did the opposite of Mick Fanning’s mate Julian Wilson… when my mate saw the shark circling  he bolted to the beach! (To his credit  this was the only blemish on an otherwise impeccable best mate record.)  The reality of shark attacks has always been present  but there is no doubt it is at quite extraordinary levels on the far North Coast. When I hear some members of board riding clubs up there are calling for a shark cull  it makes me sit up and pay attention. The surfers up there are fearless - only the bravest take on breaks like Lennox Head at 10-12 foot. Not only are they brave  these guys are keen environmentalists. They love the ocean  and they love the creatures of the ocean. And  if those guys are worried  then something must be happening.  I also totally understand that  when people see pictures of giant sharks and hear about close encounters  they get nervous and want action. But the problem is  there aren’t really any easy solutions.  From what we have seen so far in WA  it doesn’t look like shark culling has had any real effect. So  animal-rights issues aside  it isn’t certain that shark culling even works.  Here in NSW we have used shark nets along many of our beaches between Newcastle and The Gong for decades now. And in that time we have had zero shark deaths in these areas. But while the safety record is great  nets don’t just catch sharks  they catch other sea-life too. That reality is a serious concern to all of us.  There is some doubt as to whether shark nets can be effective in other areas  like the North Coast. Nets aren’t suitable for all beaches and  although we are going to look into expanding the nets  it may not be as easy as rolling more out. Again  there are environmental concerns that need to be weighed up and all of this would need to be considered by the local communities involved.  During the election  I announced we were investing money in trialling some new technologies  like sonar buoys  to help protect against sharks. This technology is in its early stages  and it has its share of problems (like figuring out how to tell the difference between a dolphin and a shark) but we are continuing to explore it and my real hope is that technological advances will eventually mean we can replace the nets altogether so we can have safe beaches with no nets required.  In fact  to help speed that process up  we are having an international summit on sharks next month and we are seeking all ideas from the best minds to ensure we are doing all we can.  In the immediate term  we are spending $250 000 ahead of spring and summer to increase surveillance and shark tagging to try and reduce the risk of further attacks.  In short  I want you to know we are doing what we can to take measured and effective action to keep our beaches as safe as we can. But it will be done based on fact  not emotion.  Our beaches and surf are an amazing part of way of life in Australia  and we all want to make sure it stays that way.  See you out in the water.,HER,photo

Adam Goodes is an incredibly talented footballer. He is a passionate advocate for his people and his country. He has received the highest honours in the game. He has been recognised by the nation as Australian of the Year. And right now  he is hurting.  Regardless of the conscious or subconscious motivations of the hecklers  we can all see that Goodsey is hurting to the point of not wanting to lace up his boots. And  whichever team we support  surely we can all agree that risking the premature ending of the career of one of AFL’s great players is totally unacceptable.  There is a place for good-natured heckling in Australian sport. I’ve booed a few Queensland league players in my time (Wally Lewis comes to mind). And some may argue that the line between good-natured and malicious heckling can be fuzzy. But there is nothing fuzzy about this. The line has been crossed.  There are many things we pride ourselves on as Australians… and good sportsmanship is right at the top of that list. The relentless booing of Adam Goodes breaks this spirit of good sportsmanship. It must stop.    Goodsey… I hope you feel the waves of support from the many thousands of supporters that have got your back. I can’t wait for you to get back on the field. When you do  I’ll be cheering loudly for you. And I won’t be alone.,HER,status
Pretty big day yesterday. When I got home last night…  Daughter: So what happened today dad?  Me: I announced a proposal to increase the GST.  Daughter: Dad... That’s not a great way to make friends.  She has a point. But  the tough challenges we face have no easy answers. And when there are no easy answers  politicians tend to just bicker  try and scare people  make misleading claims about one another and kick the can down the road.  Australia deserves better than that.   If we don’t make some tough choices  our health system simply won't have the funding to survive. And I believe we can find a way to fund it whilst financially looking after those who need it most.  So  as our nation’s leaders gather tomorrow  my plea is that we keep open minds and work constructively to solve this problem.   It may not win us many friends. But it may just win Australia the future it deserves.,HER,photo
Like many of you  I’m sick of politics in this country. Petty bickering  sloganeering  chasing the next cheap headline.   Our nation has some big problems looming  perhaps the most pressing of which is funding our health system. In 15 years from now  we face a $35 billion funding crises that threatens to end healthcare as we know it.   Solving this problem will require more than the usual smear and fear. It will require leadership and ideas.  This week  as the Premiers and PM gather  I’ll be proposing increasing in the GST to 15% with all the extra revenue going to healthcare and compensating lower income earners so they are no worse off. It won't be popular. But tough decisions rarely are.  My call to our leaders is this: bring a constructive idea to the table. Let’s rise above the usual politics that everyone detests. Let’s solve the big problems that confront this nation. It’s what we’ve been elected to do.,HER,video

I'm very pleased to announce that NSW will introduce Australia's most generous travel concessions for asylum seekers.

But I believe it is our willingness to share our luck that makes us a great country.

Watching a 900 tonne tunnel boring machine emerge from the earth just never gets old.   Elizabeth  who stars in this video  is one of our four tunnel boring machines.

The SES  emergency services  and telephone and power companies are continuing to work hard during this initial cleanup and restoration phase. We are also working quickly to get assistance to towns most heavily affected  including personal hardship payments and any other resources that may be required.,HER,photo
The weather over Sydney  the Central Coast and the Hunter is forecast to worsen tonight so the SES is encouraging everyone to head home early while it is still daylight.

We've cancelled another three CSG licences that were granted under Labor.   These three licences covered nearly a million hectares of land.

We have reduced this to 11.3% and put a moratorium on any new applications.

I had front row seats as Elizabeth  one of our 900 tonne mega Tunnel Boring Machines  emerged from the ground after digging 2.1km of tunnel for the North West Rail Link. Gladys looked pretty happy after Elizabeth emerged! And Gladys should be proud  because she is delivering the goods as we #rebuildnsw.   Was great to celebrate today's milestone  and I captured this video to give you a #bairdseyeview (sorry  pretty bad dad-joke there...)  This project is so far $300 Million UNDER budget  and 4 of these tunnel boring machines are hard at work digging Australia's longest railway tunnels for a rail link that will see 8 new stations built and a train arrive every 4 minutes.   So far  Elizabeth has:  • Excavated more than 206 000 tonnes of crushed rock  both sandstone and shale  • Installed more than 7 300 concrete segments to line the new rail tunnel • Been home to 85 workers  including tunnellers  maintenance crews  geologists  surveyors and engineers  who combined have spent more than 25 000 hours underground and • Had 40 hardened steel cutters on her cutter head replaced  worn down from the harsh forces of cutting the Sydney sandstone and shale.  Elizabeth has no time for a holiday though. She will be back in the ground real soon  setting off again towards Showground Station.,HER,video

A big thank you to the volunteers who took every care to remove flowers from Martin Place respectfully ahead of forecast wet weather.  The NSW Government will make a $100 000 contribution to both of the charities that have been established/chosen by the Dawson and Johnson families.

I share everyone’s rage that the Lindt café hostage taker was out on bail.  The public need to know: We have already taken action and strengthened the bail laws. The new  tougher laws come into effect next month. I am advised that these laws would have succeeded where our old laws have failed us.  Like everyone  I want these laws implemented as soon as possible. The timeline has been established in cooperation with the Police and they advise that next month is the fastest the new laws can be implemented.  The advice I have from NSW Police is that the hostage taker did not have a gun license. Questions remain around how he was in possession of a weapon. We will get to the bottom of it.  I am determined that we will learn from these events. I’ve announced  along with the Prime Minister  that we will be having a full review of the events leading up to the siege.  I assure you: If we have to do anything more  we will.  This morning I have been back to the tribute space in Martin Place. What I’ve seen here is beyond words. People laying flowers… four year olds through to 75 year olds  people of different faiths and backgrounds  hugging and comforting each other. We’ve come together like never before.   The flowers show the city has its beating heart back. We will get through this together.,HER,status

This morning I come before you with the heaviest of hearts.  Unbelievably  overnight we have lost a number of our own citizens  in an attack we thought we’d never see here in our city.  But the values we held dear yesterday we hold dear today. They are the values of freedom  democracy and harmony.  These defined us yesterday. They define us today. They will define us tomorrow.  Our first thoughts and prayers this morning are with the innocent victims their families and friends of this vicious  horrendous attack.  I want to say to their family and friends  everyone in NSW stands beside you. This morning. Tomorrow. Forever.  I pay tribute to the men and women of the NSW Police who have saved many many lives over the past day and have risked their lives in doing so. I also want to pay tribute to all other emergency service workers and authorities who have provided vital assistance.  My thoughts remain with those hostages who have been freed. Every care they need at this traumatic time will be made available to them.  We are a peaceful  harmonious society which is the envy of the world.  How we react in coming days will show who we are. We will come through this.  Today  while we grieve  we must go about our usual lives -- we work  we talk to our families  neighbours and friends.  And I say to everyone… today we must come together like never before. We are stronger together. We will get through this together.,HER,status

Yesterday the Obama White House had the nerve to say someone else was unqualified for office. After 5 years of acting like a King and ignoring our constitution  that takes a lot of nerve. Today I would like to put a mirror in front of the Obama White House and show them the top ten things that make HIM unqualified  1.  Tried to take over 1/6 of economy in Obamacare  wrecked the system and hurt patients and taxpayers  2.  Thinks an executive order is legislation and how you make law  3.  Fought an undeclared  unconstitutional war in Libya  turned it into Jihadist wonderland  4.  Fighting an undeclared  unconstitutional war in Syria  trying to put ISIS in Damascus.  5.  Signed into law the indefinite detention of American citizens   6.  His copy of the bill of rights obviously goes from 1 to 3  skipping 2nd amendment.  7.  Court ruled his NSA spying on every American was illegal.  8.  He has added more debt than anyone in history.  9.  Appointed an attorney general who thinks speech against Muslims is a bigger threat than terrorism.  10.  EPA rules by executive FIAT trying to kill an entire American industry and way of life (coal).,HER,status

***I’m taking a stand to defund Planned Parenthood. Are you with me?***  "We've been very good at getting heart  lung  liver  because we know that  so I'm not gonna crush that part."  That's a direct quote from a video released today showing Planned Parenthood's Senior Director of Medical Services describing how she performs late-term abortions to dismember and sell body parts for profit!   This callous disrespect for human life sickens me.  Despite their best efforts  I doubt our national media will succeed in covering this story up.   But I'm afraid that's not enough. It's time for the American people to demand Congress take action.  If you agree  I hope you'll sign your "Stand for Life: Defund Planned Parenthood" Petition immediately: https://randpaul.com/f/stand-for-life-petition?sr=714fb1a  Congress holds the power of the purse. So this is one measure Congress can take now -- even with President Obama in the White House.  And it's up to you and me to ensure my colleagues in Congress take action  and set the stage for a pro-life President to sign even more pro-life legislation into law once elected.  No one else will do it for us.  After all  where is the media now?  Where's the storm over this video that shows this Planned Parenthood executive bragging about performing banned partial-birth abortions and selling babies' body parts for profit?  Where are all the hard-hitting questions to pro-abortion Democrats about their support  with taxpayer dollars  for this kind of madness?  It's time for pro-lifers to take a stand. It's time to defund Planned Parenthood.  Studies show that this alone will save unborn life.  Not only that  but Members of Congress who choose to vote to keep funding Planned Parenthood will pay a severe political price in 2016  paving the way for a pro-life President to sign pro-life legislation into law.  I believe that if our Republican Party stands strong for life  we can finally put Democrats on the defensive for their outrageous pro-abortion track record.  After all  they're the ones with a track record of standing up for partial-birth abortion. They're the ones keeping taxpayer dollars flowing to Planned Parenthood.  They're the ones who believe five and six-pound unborn babies who are still in the womb don't deserve legal protection.  Let the Abortion Lobby and their allies try and defend this madness!  That's why I hope you'll sign your "Stand for Life: Defund Planned Parenthood" Petition immediately: https://randpaul.com/f/stand-for-life-petition?sr=714fb1b  I am 100% pro-life. I have a 100% rating from the National Right to Life Committee.  I've also introduced the Life at Conception Act during my time in Congress to end abortion-on-demand. And as a U.S. Senator  I've cast every vote as a U.S. Senator in favor of life.   If elected President  I assure you I will do everything I can to end abortion-on-demand in America.  So after you've signed your petition  won't you please agree to your most generous contribution right away?  Your generous gift will help me get my pro-life message out to as many Republican Primary voters across the country as possible.   The media may attempt to give the Abortion Lobby a pass.  But with your help  I plan to expose the radical pro-abortion views held by Hillary Clinton and top Democrats.  So please  sign your "Stand for Life: Defund Planned Parenthood" Petition and chip in a contribution to help defend unborn lives: https://randpaul.com/f/stand-for-life-petition?sr=714fb1c  Thank you in advance for your support.,HER,status

Saudi Arabia  Qatar  and Kuwait are just a few of the foreign governments that helped the #Clinton Foundation raise $2 billion. Who else donated and what side deals went on between the donors  beneficiaries  and various members of the Clinton world? http://bit.ly/1FcdEFB,HER,photo
The IRS has investigated the political activities of churches and Tea Party groups. The FBI has investigated GOP governors for corruption or abuse of office  but apparently investigating the #Clinton Foundation and the millions of dollars they've raised from foreign governments is not a priority > http://bit.ly/1FcdEFB,HER,photo
It's not just the emails -- the #Clinton Foundation accepted millions in donations from governments in the Middle East that sponsor and promote radical #Islamism while #Hillary was Secretary of State. Did she really think this didn't put our national security at risk? http://bit.ly/1aXu2hF,HER,video
#Hillary's email scandal isn't the first time she's put our national security at risk. Her "misjudgments" are inexcusable and should be disqualifying for any would-be commander-in-chief. http://bit.ly/1aXu2hF,HER,photo

I am answering your questions now. We're engaged in a long war with Radical #Islamists. This will inevitably be a global war. There are Americans  French  British  and other volunteers helping the Radical Islamists. We have to rethink from the ground up our strategies  our approaches  and our very systems of implementation. That is why I have called on #Congress to have a series of hearings on why we're losing the war and what we have to do to win it. http://cs.pn/1xZ2Qnq,HER,photo

#Obama might've sounded confident in his #SOTU address last night  but showing confidence while ignoring reality isn't a sign of leadership -- just foolishness. http://bit.ly/1umAYrO #SOTU2015,HER,photo
The White House once again avoided reality this week by refusing to connect violent extremism with radical #Islamism. Are they really that confused? http://bit.ly/1ucWeAk,HER,photo
I'm answering your questions now. The events in #Paris and Washington remind us how big the gap is between reality and the #Obama Administration's refusal to admit that we are in a global war with Radical #Islamists. We need a series of congressional hearings to explore the facts of the war and the requirements of victory.,HER,photo
I am answering questions now. The attack on #CharlieHebdo and the kosher grocery store in #Paris are proof that the war with Radical Islamists is global and a real threat to all of us. President #Obama's failure to go to Paris was one more example of hiding from reality and refusing to take the side of civilization against the forces of Radical Islamist terrorism.,HER,photo

Friend sends this picture from the gas station at a Costco in Richmond  VA.   #Obama on $2.50 a gallon gas in 2012: one of those "phony  #election year promises that never come about." White House said I was "lying" that $2.50 was achievable. Well according to AAA  10% of gas stations in US were selling for less than $2.75 a gallon last week. Front page The Wall Street Journal story: "Gasoline prices have dropped below $3 a gallon at most U.S. gas stations." AAA expects another 5-15 cent drop in near future. Just think what gasoline prices would be if we had a president who supported oil and gas development on federal lands  #Keystone XL. Increase in production under Obama entirely on private land.

20 years ago today  more than 350 candidates for Congress  including myself  gathered on the steps of the Capitol to sign a Contract with America. We promised to vote on 10 key reforms if we won a majority in the House  and as a result Republicans earned control of the House for the first time in 40 years. http://bit.ly/1rAllzb #CWAat20 #Classof94,HER,photo

President #Obama has been widely criticized for his remark at a press conference last week that “we don’t have a strategy yet” for how to deal with the rise of #ISIS. But even if it was an accidental slip  it was perhaps the most candid statement of his second term. http://bit.ly/1qmYi9X,HER,photo
How would President Reagan handle the terrorist threats of the Islamic State as it grows in #Syria and #Iraq? Much differently than President #Obama: http://bit.ly/1wFwzWM #WhatWouldReaganDo,HER,photo
Does the President understand how serious a threat #ISIS presents? The reports are sobering  yet it seems the #Obama administration has no strategy to handle a threat of this scale. http://bit.ly/1qx2qnD,HER,photo
We all know President #Obama likes to #golf. But the problem with his golfing is not the many hours he spends on the course. It's the lack of strategic thinking and systematic leadership when he's not golfing that's the problem. http://bit.ly/1qr8MRI,HER,photo
Outgoing DIA director Lieutenant General Michael Flynn gave an extraordinary exit interview with James Kitfield of Breaking Defense last week. If Congress wants to understand the threats facing America  they need to schedule an exit interview with General Flynn when they return from recess. http://bit.ly/VEfQCm,HER,photo

#ISIS  Boko Haram  and #Hamas have all made their murderous intentions painfully clear. Our leaders can no longer hide from the truth  and must instead confront the grim  unyielding and violent reality that's unfolding. http://bit.ly/1kEtWPy,HER,photo

Where is the outrage?  I will answer questions during this q and a.  Last week the last Christian was driven out of Mosul by ISIS. After 2000 years there are no Christians left.  In Nigeria Bpko Harum killed 1 783 Christians last year and in the first 6 months of this year has killed 1 631 Christians.  Where is the outrage?  Where is the President?  Where is John Kerry?,HER,status
When four out of five citizens think their government is corrupt there is a big problem. It's critical that we restore integrity  effectiveness and accountability to the federal government and it will be an undertaking that's far bigger and more profound than simply defeating President #Obama. http://bit.ly/1qEnDy5,HER,photo
Should disarming Hamas be part of a ceasefire?,HER,status
The President’s FAA-imposed ban on flights into Ben Gurion International Airport was the most hostile step any American president has ever taken toward #Israel.

Guatemala and Mexico last week agreed to make it even easier for people to show up at the American border. You would think that after all the public outcry against thousands of foreigners crossing our #border  the Mexican government would help stop the wave of people traversing Mexico to get to Texas.

Obama's border strategy is absurd  expensive  and just another opportunity for the Left to create even bigger government.

President Nelson Mandela was one of the greatest leaders of our lifetime.  He emerged from 27 long years in prison with a wisdom  a compassion  and a commitment to helping other people that was astonishing. His life was a triumph of the human spirit.  When he visited the Congress I was deeply impressed with the charisma and the calmness with which he could dominate a room. It was as if the rest of us grew smaller and he grew stronger and more dominant the longer the meeting continued.  His thoughtful  disciplined  but friendly and warm personality made him a leader who could define the right policies and the right behaviors.  Nelson Mandela was truly the father of an integrated  democratic South Africa.  He will be an inspiration for generations to come and an historic leader worth studying for as long as people want to learn about greatness in serving others.  Callista and I extend our condolences and our prayers to the Mandela family and to the people of South Africa.,HER,status

If the House Republicans hang on and get concessions they will have set the stage for three more years of forced concessions.

In the 1995-96 government shutdowns  both Newt and President Clinton understood that they were required to negotiate to reach an agreement.

The President's war on coal is in fact a war on Americans. Newt says the President's new regulations on coal will hurt American businesses  drive up energy costs  and put hundreds of hard-working Americans out of work  all so Obama can appeal to wealthy left wing environmental activists concerned about climate change. Like if you agree.,HER,link
With nearly 50 million Americans on food stamps and a food stamp program that does little to encourage people out of dependency and into self-sufficiency  it is clear a change is needed. Newt says that Rep.

With some of the toughest gun laws in the country  Chicago had more than 500 murders last year - more than any other city in the nation and more than the number of coalition troops killed in Afghanistan in 2012.

President Obama said he wouldn't add a single dime to the deficit on Tuesday  but as Newt explains in this week's newsletter  if you go through the president's address it is clear that this is simply not true.

Two more years of high unemployment is a status quo we can't afford to accept. We can do better than this.   Yet with the economy faltering and these millions out of work  President Obama has nothing to offer. He has no plan to help get the economy growing again. He has no ideas to create jobs. His initiatives are largely rhetorical.   His model for job-creation has been miserably inadequate from the start  because it relied on the government to fund particular projects and companies -- regardless of their merit. That model can succeed in spending a lot of money  but with 12.7 million people out of work  it's far too narrow to make a dent in the unemployment problem.   There are only so many green energy companies to throw taxpayer money at. There are only so many bridges to visit for a photo op.,HER,link

President Obama’s anti-American-energy policies have been incredibly destructive. In addition to revoking the leases for oil shale development in the American west  in just four years he has:  •Obstructed new drilling offshore  where only 2.2 percent of federal land is currently being leased for production.  •Killed the Keystone XL pipeline to transport Canadian oil to the United States  where it could be refined in our refineries and sold in our gas stations.  •Proposed tens of billions of dollars in new taxes on oil producers every single year in his budget.  •Demonized energy producers and lambasted “tax breaks for oil companies” which in reality apply to all U.S. manufacturers.  •Harassed oil and gas companies in North Dakota with trumped-up charges under the 1918 Migratory Bird Act.  •Attempted to institute massive new carbon taxes by dictate  allowing the EPA to classify carbon dioxide as a pollutant—even after Congress directly rejected his cap-and-tax scheme.  ,HER,link

Endorsements are always meaningful to any candidate.  But  as running to be the next Commandar-in-Chief  it is an honor  and a privilege to receive Colonel Steele's endorsement. - Newt Gingrich  Please 'Share' this endorsement from a true  American hero.,HER,link
Dear Facebook Friend   This has been a tumultuous quarter  with its fair share of highs and lows. The media is less than thrilled with the idea of an experienced conservative systematically dismantling the failed liberal policies that they champion. This election is a historic clash of ideology  and if the ideals of liberty are going to carry the argument  our nominee must not timidly pull his punches. I am prepared to challenge every radical policy  every radical appointment  and every radical idea of the Obama administration  and I will not shy away from exposing the worst President in American history.   Today we have an opportunity to strike a blow to the Democrats' media machine by disproving the ridiculous narrative that this campaign does not have the resources to compete. My staff has informed me that we are now less than $500 000 from reaching $10 million raised in the fourth quarter. Surpassing ten million would be an incredible achievement and with your help I know we can do it!   I am proud of how we have run this campaign  and am confident that with the help of thousands of supporters around the country we can surpass the $10 million mark. As an extra bonus  everyone who contributes $100 or more will receive special recognition in our New Year's Day email!  Thank You   Newt Gingrich Newt 2012,HER,link

By now you've likely heard that our effort to gain access to the primary ballot in Virginia was not successful.  This was not due to a lack of effort by our volunteers  but the cumbersome process in Virginia.    We are exploring alternate methods to compete in Virginia - stay tuned.  Going forward  we will be as in-front of the process as possible and with the help of our grassroots volunteers we will make all other deadlines.  Newt and I have talked three or four times today and he stated that this is not catastrophic - we will continue to learn and grow.  Remember that it was only a few months ago that pundits and the press declared us dead after the paid consultants left.  They declared that the decision not to compete in the Ames Straw Poll would mean that Iowans would ignore us.  Some will again state that this is fatal.    Newt and I agreed that the analogy is December 1941: We have experienced an unexpected set-back  but we will re-group and re-focus with increased determination  commitment and positive action.  Throughout the next months there will be ups and downs; there will be successes and failures; there will be easy victories and difficult days - but in the end we will stand victorious.    To help achieve that outcome we each need to spend the next 24 hours enjoying our families and friends as much as possible.  Enjoy their company.  Be grateful for them.  Gather strength from them.  The promise of a better future for our family and friends is the reason we are committed to rebuilding the America we love.    May the spirit of the season fill each of you.  Merry Christmas.

We fought the entire Second World War from December 7th 1941 to victory over Japan in August of 1945.  It is three years and eight months.  In forty-four months  we defeat Nazi German  Fascist Italy  and Imperial Japan.  It recently took twenty-three years to add a fifth runway to the Atlanta airport.  This is all humanly created incompetence.   We need a long-term plan for jobs and economic growth  not short two-month Band-Aids.  We must move now to cut taxes  reduce regulations  fully utilize America's energy resources and take steps to stabilize the value of the dollar.   As Speaker  we cut taxes  put in the largest capital gains tax cut in history  we cut regulations  we strengthened American energy  and we worked with the people who create jobs. Not only did we balance the budget for four straight years while paying off $405 billion in debt—11 million new jobs were created.

The only person helped by Mitt Romney's attack ads is Barack Obama.  The only person who is better by the attack ads of the other Republicans is Barack Obama.  If you look at the polling in the last two weeks Obama's positives are going up.  Obama's head to head against Republicans is going up.  And that's because of the attacks ads of Republicans.

WOLF: Obama supporters  Democrats  White House officials  Obama campaign officials say they look forward to running against you.  They’re nervous about Mitt Romney.    NEWT:  I remember in 1966  Governor Pat Brown  Jerry Brown’s father  was really concerned about a moderate Mayor of San Francisco named George Christopher.  He really wanted to find some right-wing actor that he could beat easily.  They were thrilled that Ronald Reagan was running.  Reagan beat him by a million votes.    I am perfectly happy for the Obama people to decide that they want to beat up on Romney.  It’s a little tough on Romney  but that’s fine with me.

I am very  very worried about our entire relationship with radical Islam because it’s based on a pack of lies.  It’s based on a pack of self-deception.  It’s based on a state department that is consistently engaged in appeasement.  It is an act of dishonesty to the American people.  The fact that the justice department has said all of its training programs on terrorism have to take out the word Islam is an outrageous denial of truth. – Newt Gingrich  ‘Like’ if you agree with Newt.  ‘Share’ this important in-depth video that outlines how a Gingrich Administration will protect America’s relationship to its ally  Israel.  http://www.newt.org/news/video-newt-speaks-republican-jewish-coalition-presidential-candidate-forum,HER,link

I think that it is astonishing that the Obama administration has now filed lawsuits on immigration against Arizona  Alabama  and South Carolina.  And  they have accepted foreign governments in the lawsuits.  The whole purpose of creating the Constitution was to bind together the States so that foreign powers could not play us off each other  and the Founding Fathers were very worried about foreign governments getting in the habit of playing us off each other.  For the Obama administration to accept foreign countries in suing South Carolina instead of being on the side of the United States and stopping it--makes me wonder what country does Obama think he's president of. - Newt Gingrich  http://www.newt.org/news/newt-slams-immigration-lawsuit-against-south-carolina,HER,link

I have lived a blessed life and achieved more success than I ever dreamed was possible. Running for President was never on my bucket list  and when I was drafted by a grassroots movement asking me to do so  it was not a decision that I made lightly and saw as an act of service.   However  I believed that my values  life experience and common sense solutions put me in a position to help get our nation back on track for the sake of our children and grandchildren. This grueling endeavor would not have been worth it for any other reason.  When I began exploring a run for President as a private citizen detached from the political class  I had neither a political team nor a national network of wealthy donors standing by waiting to support me.  We had to build a grassroots campaign from scratch by reaching out to as many people as possible  as quickly as possible and through every means possible  resulting in indisputable success. This movement consistently outraised the entire Republican field  got onto every ballot and built a 50-state  bricks-and-mortar campaign infrastructure to share my story  values and solutions. It was an historic feat  and I’ll be forever grateful to my team and my incredible supporters  financial and otherwise  from all corners of America  on behalf of the best interests of the American people.  I hope my presence added a measure of civility to the race  raised issues that would not otherwise have been discussed and had an overall positive impact. While our political efforts must come to a close  gratefully  the grassroots movement that has given new voice to “We the People” and inspired millions will continue.   I may be departing the campaign trail  but I will not be departing the scene.  Instead  for the rest of my life  I will continue to work tirelessly to do everything I can to save America for the next generation.   I will be working on a number of initiatives  including serving as honorary chair of My Faith Votes  a non-profit organization dedicated to mobilizing the 25 million Evangelicals who didn't vote in the last election. The twin pillars of faith and family are under attack  and I will endeavor to strengthen our nation by preserving them both.  I have committed to not endorse a specific individual  but rather “We the People.” Though many today are making decisions based on fear and anger  I trust their judgment to logically examine the candidates and make the right decision by looking at:  (1) Whether they have demonstrated significant accomplishments over their lives and careers.  (2) If they have ideas that are clear and policies that are easy to find.  (3) How they treat their family and others  as that is how they will lead the country.  (4) What they have done to improve the lives of Americans; the people they are with  what they are saying and how they collaborate with others.  (5) Their ethics  because what America needs is “Trickle-down ethics.  Conservatives should not be embarrassed by capitalism  but must couple it with compassion  to lift people out of a culture of dependency and provide ladders of opportunity for all Americans to be a part of the fabric of society.  People need to understand this is a most important election  in which we are deciding whether we allow the government to dictate our rights and take care of our needs  or whether individuals will rise up and take responsibility in an atmosphere of opportunity for all.  The bottom line is  “We the People” are the ones making the decisions; but in order to do that  we must become active and informed  not manipulated by the political classes and media.  Along with millions of patriots who have supported my campaign for President  I remain committed to saving America for future generations. We must not depart from our goals to restore what God and our Founders intended for this exceptional nation.   Equally important  we need to understand that Republicans are not each others' enemies. We need to engage in conversation and challenge each others' positions  not fight each other. Conservatives need to unify together so that that we do not snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and put another secular progressive in the White House.,HER,status

Today we learned that the female shooting suspect in California was apparently approved for a Visa from the Department of Homeland Security -- using a fake address on her application. If this does not cause an immediate stop to the President's Syrian Refugee Program  I am not sure what will. The fact is that ISIS has promised to try and infiltrate our country by attempting to disguise their members as refugees. This shooting not only confirms that ISIS's mission has been brought to our shore  but also confirms my greatest fear -- they have been able to get a radicalized Islamic terrorist through our vetting system.,HER,status
Official Statement from Dr.Ben Carson:  Today  I am asking Congress to stop the Obama Administration’s plans to bring in up to 45 000 Syrian refugees. There is currently no ability to vet these people.  By letting refugees into our country without vetting we are putting America at risk. If our President cannot see the risk  then we must rise to the challenge and protect our country. This morning President Obama announced at his press conference that it was our responsibility to accept these refugees. He is wrong. He took an oath to protect and defend this country. There is simply not a way to vet these refugees.   We should do everything in our power to help these men  women  and children who have been forced to flee their country  but until we can sort out the bad guys  we must not be foolish. I call for increased aid to the refugees. We can and should do more to feed the hungry and shelter the homeless. We must also protect them from being attacked by implementing immediately no fly zone over these camps.  President Obama said this morning that it would be a mistake to send more ground troops. I think plenty of mistakes have already been made. As President  I would give the mission to the Pentagon  and ask them what they need to accomplish the mission. The right number of boots on the ground is whatever number the Pentagon says they need to accomplish that mission and not a single person less. The error of armchair quarterbacking our military will end in my administration. They will get the support they need and nothing less. Both the FBI and former Intelligence Committee Chairman  Mike Rogers  have indicated that it is not possible to fully vet these refugees as there is no Syrian list to vet against. Allowing these refugees to enter our country without knowing who they are is foolish. I am talking to many experts as I can  and I have yet to find one who thinks that the Obama Syrian/ISIL strategy is anything but a failure. The only thing that President Obama seems to have contained is this foolish policy inside his government.   We need to offer more than empty tough talk. We need to say what we mean  and most importantly mean what we say. When we draw a line in the sand or boundary in the air  the world needs to understand that we mean it. Too many people across the world today think that we don’t.,HER,status

On Friday Washington political news tabloid published a story they partially retracted after it became apparent it was a fabrication. They did maintain though that I was in error when I referred to being offered a Full Scholarship they went so far as to say such a thing didn't exist. So where is the truth.   Here is a copy of the material West Point used to recruit African American high school kids.   Wouldn't you know it.  "Full Government Scholarship" printed on the front page.   I won't hold my breathe for an apology. Shame on them.,HER,photo
First it was CNN who after exhaustively interviewing 9 people who live in Detroit decided to call me a liar.  Then it was POLITICO's turn to say I lied  though it was later retracted.

Tonight  going through all of your questions  I wanted to touch on a few issues that seem to be asked by many people.    I would like to deal with one question tonight in some detail.  The issue is experience.  Several people ask what they should tell their friends when people say “I like Carson but he has no political experience”.    You are absolutely right — I have no political experience.  The current Members of Congress have a combined 8 700 years of political experience.  Are we sure political experience is what we need.  Every signer of the Declaration of Independence had no federal elected office experience.  What they had was a deep belief that freedom is a gift from God.  They had a determination to rise up against a tyrannical King.  They were willing to risk all they had  even their lives  to be free.  Today we find ourselves with an entire class of politicians.  No one in Philadelphia  during that summer our nation was born  dreamed that service was a career with a pension.  America was the land of the Citizen Statesmen.  They were merchants  lawyers  farmers — and yes  even doctors.  They were willing to stand for freedom.  Today  the political class stands in the way  not for the people.  They demand pensions and perks.  This is not what our Founders envisioned for America.  I spent my life treating very ill children.  Over 15 000 times I gave my all to prolong their lives.  I was blessed to do it.  But when it came time for me to retire  I simply could not sit back any longer.  These children became my family.  What our government is doing to them is outrageous.  I am prepared to risk all that I have to try and make a difference in their future. I built one of the nation’s best medical centers.  I served for two decades on the boards of Costco and Kellogg.  I built a national scholarship program.  My experience is very different than what we have come to expect.  I grew up poor.  I know what it is like to be homeless and hungry.  I know the pain of poverty.  I also know that education and a mother’s love can be the path out of dire poverty.  I know what it is like to see water fountains you are not allowed to drink out of because of your skin color.  I also know that once you peel back the skin  the brain is the same no matter what your skin color or continent you live on.  I know that victimhood is a trap.  I know that it is our Christian responsibility to offer those less fortunate a hand up.  I know my faith is strong and my ego is small.  I know that my path to the White House is different than most.  But I also know I bring all of the pain and joy  the success and failure  the lessons learned through love and sorrow in my life’s journey.  Bill Clinton was famous for saying “I feel your pain” — well  I have walked in your shoes.  I do not have political experience  I have a life journey.  A journey that not only made it possible for me to relate to so many different people  but also one where time and time again I was told I would fail  only to succeed.  My candidacy is different  that I grant you.  I have neither Donald Trump’s money or Jeb Bush’s political network.  However  I wouldn't trade a single child I treated for all of Trump’s money.  While I admire the Bush family’s dedication to service  I too served —  nights  weekends  holidays  birthdays and anniversaries with severely injured patients were my public service.  I didn’t go to embassy cocktail parties or beg lobbyists for money.  I spent night after night in a quiet  sterile room trying to save the life of a small child.  That was my life’s service.  This is my life’s experience.  What I have is a lifetime of caring  integrity and honesty.  I have experienced the American Dream.  No where in the world  other than America  could a man whose ancestors were slaves  rise to become a leading brain surgeon and one day seek the Office of President.  The very fact that I am running is testament to the greatness of America.  If all you want is political experience then I cannot be your candidate.  Thank you for staying up with me.

I wanted to get back to answering questions tonight sent in by you guys.  Remember  you can send in your questions via email by sending it to AskBen@BenCarson.com.  Before I get started  I wanted to thank the hundreds of thousands of you that sent birthday greetings.  I was touched and deeply appreciative.  The first issue I want to deal with tonight is the stories today about my comments yesterday when I was asked if I would support a hypothetical Muslim candidate for President.  I responded “I would not advocate for that” and I went on to say that many parts of Sharia Law are not compatible with the Constitution.  I was immediately attacked by some of my Republican peers and nearly every Democrat alive.  Know this  I meant exactly what I said.  I could never support a candidate for President of the United States that was Muslim and had not renounced the central tenant of Islam: Sharia Law.  Those Republicans that take issue with my position are amazing.  Under Islamic Law  homosexuals – men and women alike – must be killed.  Women must be subservient.  And people following other religions must be killed.  I know that there are many peaceful Muslims who do not adhere to these beliefs.  But until these tenants are fully renounced…I cannot advocate any Muslim candidate for President.  …I also can’t advocate supporting Hillary Clinton either by the way.  There were many questions about this and I wanted everyone to know exactly where I stand.  The second question comes tonight from John.  John asks “what other talents does Candy have besides violin?”    She is extremely talented.  She also plays piano and flute.  In fact  she recently recorded a CD that we plan to give to our donors as a thank you gift.  Candy also graduated from Yale and earned an MBA from Johns Hopkins.  She just finished her new book that comes out in January.  Candy is one of those people who can do just about anything.  The last question tonight is from Brenda.  Brenda asks if my family tree has been researched.    Actually  I was quite blessed that a Yale classmate of mine  Henry Louis Gates  researched my ancestors on the PBS show "African American Lives" in 2006.  My ancestors were slaves brought to the United States from a region along the border of Kenya and Tanzania.  They were brought to Georgia.  After emancipation  the family  which had been divided by their owners  was reunited.  I am very thankful for all of the research that was done by Professor Gates.  I assume you can probably find the show on YouTube.  Thank you for reading this tonight.  Most of all  thank you for standing with me in this fight to save our great country.    Goodnight  Ben,HER,status

I wanted to use our time tonight to directly deal with an attack launched on me today by the left and the media.  A couple questions came in on this subject  so I want to address it head on.  Today I was accused by the press as having done research on fetal tissue.  It simply is not true.  The study they distributed by an anonymous source was done in 1992.  The study was about tumors.  I won’t bore you with the science.  There were four doctors' names on the study.  One was mine.  I spent my life studying brain tumors and removing them.  My only involvement in this study was supplying tumors that I had removed from my patients.  Those tissue samples were compared to other tissue samples under a microscope.  Pathologists do this work to gain clues about tumors.  I  nor any of the doctors involved with this study  had anything to do with abortion or what Planned Parenthood has been doing.  Research hospitals across the country have microscope slides of all kinds of tissue to compare and contrast.  The fetal tissue that was viewed in this study by others was not collected for this study.  I am sickened by the attack that I  after having spent my entire life caring for children  had something to do with aborting a child and harvesting organs.  My medical specialty is the human brain and even I am amazed at what it is capable of doing.  Please know these attacks are pathetic attempts to blunt our progress.  Now lets get to answering your questions.  Nancy in Arkansas wants to know how my mother is doing.    Nancy  you know my mother is the only reason I stand here today.  I surely would have been lost if it were not for her.  She is an amazing woman.  If she were the Secretary of Treasury  I assure you we would have a surplus.  My mother was very ill when I announced my candidacy.  The family was called in by her doctors.  We surrounded her and prayed as did millions of you.  She began to eat again.  She has her strength back.  She is doing as well as we can expect.  Thank you for asking.  The next question is from Bill. He wanted to know if it was true that I was offered a slot at West Point after high school.    Bill  that is true.  I was the highest student ROTC member in Detroit and was thrilled to get an offer from West Point.  But I knew medicine is what I wanted to do.  So I applied to only one school.  (it was all the money I had).  I applied to Yale and thank God they accepted me.  I often wonder what might have happened had they said no.  Last question as it is getting late.  A young nurse in Ohio wants to know how many patients did I treat during my career.    I treated over 15 000 patients in some 57 countries.  We lived in Australia for a while as well.  One of the most gratifying moments of each day is when I run into a former patient like I did tonight.  My patients were all quite ill.  I love seeing them with their families living normal lives.  I think it is more gratifying than serving in Congress.  Speaking of serving in Congress.  I constantly get asked how could I possibly become President when I have no political experience.  Here is what I say.  The current Members of Congress have a combined 8 788 years of political experience.  How is that working out?  People forget that of our 56 founding fathers who risked it all to sign the Declaration of Independence  Five were Doctors.   Good night  Ben,HER,status
A leader listens when the American people speak. Unfortunately  our stage was filled with plenty of rhetoric and shouting politicians. I want We the People to know I hear you.

Last night evil walked the streets of Charleston. My heart aches for the families of the victims. I pray for the families left behind. I pray for the community scared and hurting. I also pray you and I can conquer hatred.   In my lifetime I have seen such great progress. Though racial based hate is still very much alive as last night so violently reminded us.   But I worry about a new hate that is growing in our great nation. I fear our intolerance of one another is the new battle ground of evil. Today many feel it is ok to hate someone who thinks differently than you do.   The left hates the right. The right hates the left. This attitude is poison. Poison that will sicken all of us.   Just because someone is for Obamacare and another is against doesn't change the fact we are all brothers and sisters. All Americans.   As a brain surgeon I can assure you that all of our brains look the same  no matter what our skin color or party affiliation.   The America I know and love has fought evil all over the world to protect evil's victims. At home we must dedicate ourselves to not hating anyone based on their politics.   Our leaders have walked our country down this path and it is up to us to change course.   Please join me in praying for those who lost their lives last night. Please join me in praying for comfort for their families. Please join me in praying for our great nation  that we may heal ourselves before it is too late.

#TBT We were very poor. But between the covers of books I could go anywhere  I could be anybody  I could do anything. I began to read about people of great accomplishment.

Chief NSA Chronicler on Snowden and Secret Wars  Bestselling author & journalist James Bamford wrote the definitive NSA exposé over 30 years ago. He tells Ron that he’s “astonished” by the sheer volume of intel obtained by Edward Snowden & wonders if there’s any hope of reining in the NSA.  Watch Preview Here: http://bit.ly/1mbmPei,HER,photo
Together let’s thank Edward Snowden for being the most important whistleblower of our time. Take a moment to write a note to Edward. Ron will make sure it gets to him directly.   Edward Snowden did us a massive service when he revealed the illegality  waste & abuse within the NSA spying programs. It was the NSA that committed the crimes  not Mr. Snowden.   Let him know he's not alone. Show him the support he deserves. Thank him for waking us up.  HEAR FROM RON: http://on.fb.me/1at5s1u,HER,photo

We're supposed to believe that the perpetrators of 9/11 hated us for our freedom and goodness. In fact  that crime was blowback for decades of US intervention in the Middle East. And the last thing we needed was the government's response: more wars  a stepped-up police and surveillance state  and drones.,HER,photo
More so than anyone else  my supporters know that America cannot afford another unlawful  immoral war in the Middle East. Stand with me and tell President Obama to stay out of Syria.   Please sign and share my petition:  http://bit.ly/17oFmzn,HER,photo
My understanding is that espionage means giving secret or classified information to the enemy. Since Snowden shared information with the American people  his indictment for espionage could reveal (or confirm) that the US Government views you and me as the enemy.,HER,status

Dear loyal friends and supporters:  We live in the greatest country on earth and I ran for President because I wanted to make it better for my 5 grandkids.  I have no regrets about the effort because it’s never our responsibility to determine the results  but to be faithful to the task before us.  I have suspended my campaign  but not my desire to see America protect all human life  reward those who work hard  and give our veterans and seniors what they have paid the price to earn.    I am blessed with an incredibly supportive wife and family who never wavered in their confidence in me.  Our campaign staff was amazing—they gave it their all with competence  compassion  and a spirit of teamwork that I will forever cherish.  Our effort didn’t fall short due to lack of effort and expertise from our team.  And our volunteers every day were stunning and beyond belief in their efforts.  On days when I was exhausted and getting hammered by polls  idiotic media questions  or long car rides  I would read a post on FB from one of our supporters or get a letter from a donor that gave me fresh energy and determination.    While I truly wish the results were different  I would rather lose with honor than win without it.  Thank you so much for your prayers  your sacrifices of time and money  and your tireless efforts for our campaign.  Rumors abound that I’m getting ready to endorse someone  but those rumors are totally untrue.  While I may eventually support one of the candidates  right now I have a lot of things to do in wrapping up the loose ends of the campaign  trying to figure out my next chapter of life  and spending some time with my dogs who probably wonder if I had abandoned them.  (I haven’t!)  I love you guys  and want to stay in touch.  I am eternally grateful for you!  WIth gratitude and great respect   Mike Huckabee,HER,status

Iowa: On the campaign trail  many people ask me why pass the FairTax? My answer is simple: Our current system is backwards. Why do we punish hard work and income? Why does our tax system reward irresponsibility? By taxing sales instead of income  we encourage productivity and savings  which will jump-start our economy. Americans also spend more than $500 billion complying with our tax code each year. This is an inefficient waste of time  energy and money.,LER,status

For too long American families and workers have been pushed aside while self aggrandizing Washington DC politicians feign leadership and offer only political theater and flowery speeches. For too long an out of control judiciary has forced their compromised values on Americans of faith and American seniors have had to live in fear of politicians stealing from Social Security. For too long  we have watched our nation’s security erode  withered by political correctness and liberal ideology.  It’s time we take our nation back.

Yesterday morning  President Obama declared that we had “contained ISIS.”  Yet a week ago  ISIS murdered 224 people aboard a Russian plane  and now Friday night  Paris was struck by a multi-layered attack that resulted in over 125 people murdered  many more wounded  and a world again left in shock.  We are clearly not dealing with leashed animals or with a JV team.  We’re dealing with a threat to western civilization.  During the debate last week  I stated that we should not admit those claiming to be Syrian refugees and was condemned by the left for that position.  I was right and the events in Paris affirm that.  Even the far left and politically correct government of France has closed its borders.  It’s time for a President who will act to protect Americans  not just talk and protect the image of Islam.   I call for the following:   1.  Close our borders instead of Guantanamo.  2.  Institute an immediate moratorium on admission to those persons from countries where there is strong presence of ISIS or Al-Qaeda. 3.  Build a coalition that will include NATO  Russia  and nations of the Middle East to aggressively destroy ISIS.  Nations who refuse to participate will be sanctioned and isolated. 4.  Revoke any agreement with Iran regarding their nuclear capacity.  Radical Islamists  whether Sunni or Shia  are a clear and present danger to civilization.,HER,status

We hardly know any of the details about this horrific tragedy - What kind of gun was used? How did the shooter obtain it?  What is the motive? Does the shooter have a history of mental illness? Was this an act of terror?  With few facts  Obama is quick to admittedly politicize this tragedy to advance his liberal  anti-gun agenda. For this president to make a political pronouncement is at best premature and at worst ignorantly inflammatory.   Obama can shamelessly try and exploit any tragedy he wants  but it's clear that gun free zones are sitting duck zones.   His passion is grossly misplaced into destroying the Second Amendment. There were 50 shootings in Chicago the past two weekends and this administration failed to utter a word. Gun violence is a problem in this country  but it's not the fault of the Second Amendment it's the fault of evil people doing evil things.,HER,status

President Obama's classless decision to transform Pope Francis' visit to the White House into a politicized cattle call for gay and lesbian activists is an insult to the Pope and millions of Catholics.

Usually  the Obama White House relies on Jonathan Gruber-style smoke-and-mirrors to distract people from what it’s really doing.

My wife Janet and I are privileged to consider Sean and Sandy Parnell our friends of many years.  Governor Parnell has been a rock solid conservative for Alaska and is one of the strongest pro life governors in the country.  The Juneau Empire reported that  if legislation on marriage equality or abortion rights comes to the desk when Bill Walker is Governor  he said:  “We’ll make that decision at that time. I can’t guarantee how I will decide on a bill that comes across our desk.”  You don’t have to wonder where Governor Parnell stands on life.  Supporting traditional marriage and protecting the unborn are foundational issues.  Governor Parnell’s record has earned him the support of National Right to Life and the Alaska Family Council.  I hope you will join me in supporting Sean Parnell for reelection as Governor.  Please visit www.Parnell2014.com to volunteer  make a generous contribution or learn more.,LER,status

While the CDC seems to react to Ebola with all the efficiency of a headless chicken  there is an organization that really seems to know what to do: the Firestone tire company.  NPR reports that Firestone has a rubber plantation in Harbel  Liberia  and basically runs the town.  When an employee’s wife came down with Ebola  they immediately went into crisis mode.  With no place to treat her and no experience  they went to the Internet for info. Within one day  they’d built an Ebola ward; within two days  they’d quarantined her and obtained hazmat suits.  The woman died  but out of nearly 80 000 workers and family members  nobody else contracted Ebola.  And when it hit the surrounding area  Firestone expanded its treatment facilities  paid laid-off teachers to educate people on the disease and trained its janitors in sanitary body disposal.  John McCain thinks we need an Ebola Czar.  Maybe we just need to take the job away from Washington and give it to Firestone.,HER,status

We don’t need to look much farther than Washington to realize most adults don’t know the first thing about managing money-maybe it’s because they never learned as kids. And since less than 40% of schools teach money management  I asked my team to create a film that makes it fun for kids to learn this critical skill. It’s called “Money Doesn’t Grow On Trees” and I’m giving it away for FREE at www.FreeMoneyForKids.com/gift.html  But please don’t wait. We only have a limited number of FREE copies available.  My team created this film  Money Doesn’t Grow On Trees  because not enough of our kids’ schools are teaching the money management skills our children will need for life. We’re giving it away for FREE because it’s a lesson that every child needs to know and it’s just too important not to pass on. If you choose to receive the film  you will just need to cover s&h  and if you order now  you will be set up to receive other great films from our new product line called MoneyBright Kids as they are released about once a month at an affordable  low price. Each film features important money management concepts like charity  earning  saving  how to spend wisely  and investing. Of course  since this is a free offer  there’s no obligation or commitment. But you’ll love the positive  fun and informative lessons that your children or grandchildren will take away. MoneyBright Kids always guarantees that kids will learn and have fun  or your money back.

With the rise of ISIS  Christians in the Middle East are scared to practice their beliefs because their governments don’t protect their right to worship like ours has since America’s earliest days. Sadly  not enough of our kids know the incredible role of God in US History. That's why we produced a DVD for kids on God's role in American history. And it’s so important  I want you to have it for FREE at www.FreeGodDVD.com/gift.html    But please don’t wait. We only have a limited number of FREE copies remaining.  My team at Learn Our History created this DVD because too many children don't know the story of God's role in American history. We’re giving it away for FREE because it’s a story that every child has a right to know and it’s just too important not to pass on. One Nation Under God teaches kids all about God’s role in the creation of our nation and how our rights and freedoms come directly from God  not the government. If you choose to receive the film  you will just need to cover s&h  and if you order now  you will be set up to receive other great films from Learn Our History about important events in American history as they are released about once a month at an affordable  low price.

Hawaii  each day I thank God for your freedom and for the men and women in uniform who provided it. I have a good friend  Martha Cothren  a social studies teacher at Joe T. Robinson High School  in Little Rock. Her father was a WWII POW  and she is a true patriot. On the first day of school in 2005  Martha wanted to give her students a lesson on freedom they wouldn’t forget. With the permission of her principal  she removed the desks from her classroom. When the students came for first period and asked where their desks were  Martha told them they would get a desk when they could tell her how to earn one. Students suggested good grades  or good behavior  but Martha told them while those were important  it would not earn them a desk. As each period came and went  students were stumped as to how to earn a desk and word spread across campus about the teacher who had lost her mind and taken the desks out. Students called their parents  some called the media and local television crews showed up to find out what was going on. At the last period of the school day  when no student had correctly answered how to earn a desk  Martha Cothren went to the classroom door and opened it  and welcomed a parade of veterans who walked in carrying school desks. As they brought in the desks and lined them in rows  Martha told them  “Kids  you don’t have to earn your desks; these guys already did.” I salute great teachers and patriots across our land who honor our veterans. And most of all  I salute our veterans  who earned me more than a school desk. They earned me my freedom. To them  I say thanks. And God bless you!

Last weekend  a tragedy on a Sprint car racetrack in NY resulted in the tragic death of Kevin Ward  Jr. who had gotten out of his car and was hit and killed by Tony Stewart.  The investigation continues  but it did not stop at least one sports commentator from one of the most idiotic accusations this side of accusing George Bush being responsible for 911.  Here’s the comment from ESPN’s Colin Cowherd: “It’s really  really part of the South  and it’s an eye-for-an-eye culture.”    Really?  So this guy thinks the death of Kevin Ward is because of a southern culture?  Since Ward is a native of New York and Stewart is from Indiana  I guess I’m not getting the geographical connection  but as a proud Southerner  I take offense at some guy whose name rhymes with cow turd trying to blame southerners for a testosterone fueled feud between two Yankee drivers.  Cowherd reveals his ignorance of southern culture by invoking an eye for an eye as being Southern.  Maybe he should get out more.    If you have a flat tire on a country road in Mississippi  you won’t be there long before someone in a pickup truck stops to help you change it.  People in Arkansas still pull over to the side of the road so a funeral procession can go by; A fellow who kills a deer in Georgia will probably give you some of the meat for your family; catching a mess—yes  we call it a mess of fish means the neighbors will get some too; total strangers in Tennessee will say hello  and when people say they will pray for you in South Carolina  they really will.  I don’t know where the goon from ESPN is from  but it ain’t from the south.  If he wants to make a complete fool of himself  he should come see us and try to show us how to cook grits  make redeye gravy  run a trotline in Louisiana  set a hook on a largemouth bass  field dress a deer  or clean a Weatherby 300 mag rifle.  He can explain to us the difference between King james version and the NIV  sing Amazing Grace in 4 octaves  and play fiddle in a country band.

Attention Michigan:  Huck PAC and I are proud to endorse Gary Glenn for Michigan State Representative. Gary Glenn  I first met Gary six years ago  and the more I've learned about his life's work  the more impressed I am at his knowledge and experience on a wide array of issues. Gary has been a nationally recognized leader on labor law reform  free market healthcare reform  School Choice  and defense of commonly-shared community values such as protecting prenatal life and traditional marriage.  Gary Glenn has a life-long track record of actually getting things done for our conservative values and principles. He is recognized as a strong pro-life leader in Michigan  and supports the 2nd Amendment. Gary was one of two coauthors of Michigan's Marriage Protection Amendment and as a state representative he will sponsor legislation for a state Fair Tax.

Huck PAC and I have endorsed Bruce Westerman for Congress.  Here is just one reason why  his strong stand for repealing Obamacare:  ""When Nancy Pelosi said passing Obamacare would allow us to see what was in it  I am sure she was hoping people would overlook the subsidies portion of the law ruled on today by two different circuit courts.  In fact  both rulings  though conflicting  highlight the fact that Obamacare was a poorly-written takeover of people's healthcare and an ill-conceived law that would be enforced by a scandal-plagued IRS.  There is only one option for Obamacare at this point: Repeal."   Please join me in supporting Bruce by LIKING his Facebook page here ---> https://www.facebook.com/WestermanAR,LER,link
I’ve been asked several times what is the Christian thing to do about the tens of thousands of unaccompanied children who have fled to the United States illegally.  Let’s be clear—there is a Christian thing and there’s a government thing.  I find it interesting that the same people who scream for separation of church and state now want the government to act like a church and provide assistance and benevolence.  Helping the poor and aiding the homeless and the helpless is indeed the duty of the church.  But the duty of the government is to protect us—not provide for us.  If the border agents are playing wet nurse and changing diapers and beds  then we aren’t protected very well.  Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s and unto God the things that are God’s.   If Christians would give a dime of each dollar in tithes to fund assistance to the needy  the government wouldn’t need to be a big charity.   Government isn’t supposed to rearrange people’s social standing and redistribute income.   Instead of straining social service budgets and education budgets and court budgets in the US  it would be better if our government acted competently and did its Constitutional job to secure our borders.  The churches  charities and relief organizations could deliver supplies to those in need around the world.  We should be interested in helping the people of other nations experience the fruits of freedom and free enterprise.  If they wish to come to America  we should welcome them when they come through the same legal process that we would have to go through to go to their countries.  But to not have a border is to not have a brain.  We can love people and love security at the same time.  But if you give up security  you really don’t love the people very much either.,HER,status

Today  a story about atheists that you WILL not believe… After 9/11  two steel beams were found in the World Trade Center rubble  fused into the shape of a cross.  The Ground Zero Cross inspired so many people  it’s now in the Ground Zero Museum.  But some atheists are suing to remove it.  They call it “offensive and repugnant” and claimed its very existence gave them stomach aches  depression  headaches  anxiety  and mental pain and anguish. They dropped that silly claim after a state court tossed their suit.  But now  they’re appealing to a federal court.  The American Center for Law and Justice filed a brief arguing that acknowledging history is not establishing a state religion  or else we’d have to remove all religious paintings from public art museums.  Hey  don’t give them any ideas!  The court gave the atheists until July 14th to explain why their personal offense constitutes a Constitutional crisis.  They might also ponder this:  If a cross has that much power over them  are they sure they’re atheists?,HER,status

New Yorkers aren’t afraid of our diversity.  On Tuesday  I was in Cambridge talking with students at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government  when I was asked how we should treat immigrants  how we should balance security with acceptance. I think many forces are trying to politicize this  but this goes deeper than politics. It goes to the core of who we are as a nation.  If the day comes when America says “close the gates  build the wall ” then I say take down the Statue of Liberty  because we’ve gone to a different place. The poem on the Statue of Liberty reads  “Give me your tired  your poor  your huddled masses yearning to breathe free ” On the day this is no longer true  we will have lost sight of who we are.  I won’t let the reactionaries win by conceding the defeat of the American Dream.  I have a question for the Governors who say they will refuse to let the refugees in: How?   Where does it say in your state’s constitution that you can refuse a person placed by the Federal Government? What are you going to do  have your militia stand on the borders of your state? It’s up to the Federal Government. If they let refugees in and place them in your state  Governors have no authority to turn them down.   Having said that  this is a complex issue.  We have to protect Americans. The Federal Government has to screen the people who are coming in. They have to do it right  do it exhaustively  but do so without giving up our soul as Americans.  The next time the Republican candidates take to a podium  they’re going to try and confuse the issue  talk about how immigrants are the problem  to use this as a justification to make us afraid of them  and to further divide us. That’s not how we think in New York. Here in New York  we aren’t afraid of our immigrants  we celebrate them. As I've said many times before  in New York our diversity is our strength.   The Statue of Liberty is still in the harbor  and the doors are open.,HER,status

As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  I believe we have a constitutional duty to fill the vacancy left after Justice Antonin Scalia's death  and I look forward to helping get a nominee confirmed. A Supreme Court seat hasn't been open for longer than a year for over a century. The longest time any current justice took to be confirmed was 99 days  and 14 justices have been confirmed during election years. The Constitution says that the President "shall" nominate Supreme Court justices with the advice and consent of the Senate. We need to do our jobs.,HER,status
BREAKING: Here's some great news for our state and two of our best allies: Minnesota's Sam Heins has finally been confirmed as Ambassador to Norway  and Azita Raji has been confirmed as Ambassador to Sweden. Norway hasn't had an ambassador for 869 days! These nations are our close partners  and it's time to get a top diplomat back to work. I vowed to go to the floor every day until people stopped objecting. It worked ... but I was running out of Swedish and Norwegian stories and facts. Maybe I should have some lutefisk to celebrate tonight!,HER,status

BREAKING NEWS: The Supreme Court has just ruled in favor of marriage equality! This is a momentous day in our country’s pursuit of equality and justice. The Supreme Court has affirmed what many states  including Minnesota  have already proudly recognized: same-sex couples deserve the right to marry.

Yesterday I reintroduced my legislation that would allow Medicare to negotiate the price of prescription drugs  helping to cut costs for more than 37 million seniors enrolled in Medicare Part D. The fact that Medicare can't currently negotiate drug prices is a bad deal for seniors and taxpayers. It's time for seniors to have the medicines they need at the lowest possible price.,HER,status
We spend 40% more on prescriptions than the next highest-priced country and twice as much as Germany. AARP found common brand-name drugs often used by seniors rose 13% in 2013. It's time to pass my bill with Sen. John McCain to allow safe Canadian imports  crack down on "pay for delay" deals (my bill with Sen. Chuck Grassley) and let Medicare negotiate drug prices. I wrote this Christmas-themed piece on the subject:  http://strib.mn/1CvfjW7,HER,status
Drug costs have skyrocketed. Wages have not. That's why I've joined with Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona on legislation that would allow reimportation of medications from Canada.

Please share with your friends:  The President was in Minnesota today and I spoke at the Lake Harriet bandshell before his remarks. He talked from the heart about how people need to stop giving in to the cynicism they see every day on TV. There is so much we can do right now...increasing the minimum wage  making it easier to pay for college  immigration reform...but these common sense ideas have been blocked by a cynicism in Washington that can only be overcome by people casting their votes this November.  A few miles away from where the President spoke are these words etched on the gravestone of Minnesota's most endearing Senator Hubert Humphrey: "I have enjoyed my life  its disappointments outweighed by its pleasures. I have loved my country in a way that some people consider sentimental and out of style. I still do. And I remain an optimist with joy  without apology  about this country and about the American experiment in democracy."  At some point Washington's obsession with the roller coaster of day-to-day news and scandals and up-and-down polls all become a blur and a distraction. The President reminded us today that what really matters is the people of our country--their work  their hopes  their dreams. That's what this "American experiment in democracy" is all about and that's what our President  "with joy and without apology " was here in Minnesota to say.,HER,status
I wanted to share this story about the heroism of Minnesota's first responders during our torrential downpours and floods: One night this week a woman called 911 and said her car was being swept away. State Trooper Brian Beuning pushed through rushing water  got her out of the car and held on to her until help arrived. The car ended up in a field 1/4 mile away. A Department of Natural Resources boat tried to rescue them  but the current was too swift. Finally  two Luverne firefighters tied themselves to a semi truck  and rescued them. Good work  Trooper Beuning and all our first responders!,HER,photo

Gave Senate floor speech today on the 276 Nigerian schoolgirls who were abducted at gunpoint from their high school by a terrorist group called Boko Haram  which literally means "western education is sinful." A video released today from an alleged leader claims that they are selling the girls in the "market." Let's call this what it is: Human trafficking. We need a U.N. resolution condemning this attack and calling on nations for assistance. We need to provide intelligence to contribute to the search. And we need to strengthen local law enforcement to take on groups that sell girls. It's time to show our nation's commitment to the fight against modern-day slavery.,HER,status
We lost a true friend today. Former Congressman Jim Oberstar died in his sleep last night. He was a mentor and a friend and a man of true purpose and grit. His life journey took him from the hardscrabble mines of northern Minnesota to the chairmanship of one of the most powerful committees in Congress. He traveled the country and the world helping people  sharing knowledge and always speaking his mind  sometimes in French.  Every miner should remember his work to keep the mines open and make them safer.  Every American who bikes the Minnesota bike trails  hikes the Lake Superior trail  and drives our national highways and bridges should remember Jim today.    To the end he loved Jean and his family  his Slovenian heritage  his long bike rides  and anything and everything about transportation policy. We will miss him dearly.,HER,status

Today I spoke on the Senate floor about how the shutdown is leaving our country without critical medical research  food safety inspections  and disease outbreak investigators. This is unacceptable. I recently met a mother whose son has muscular dystrophy. She put it best when she said that when it comes to finding a cure  "every day matters." The Senate has already passed a straightforward bill to stop the shutdown and over 20 House Republicans have now said they would vote for it. This means it would pass if the Speaker allowed for a vote. We need to do more than pay our government employees to stay home. We need them to get back and do the jobs they were hired to do. Every day matters.,HER,status
The government shutdown is threatening our economy and causing real pain for many families. Members of Congress shouldn't be getting paid while our government is closed  and that's why I'm giving my pay during the shutdown to the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health.

A lot more work ahead in 2013  including a comprehensive plan that balances revenue and spending cuts to reduce debt.,HER,status

The only difference between a person who hurts someone in a dark alley & a person who hurts someone in their own living room is a closed door. Violence is violence regardless of where it occurs. That's why I joined my colleagues in the Senate today to urge the House to take action on the Violence Against Women Act  legislation that is critical to combat domestic violence & help victims get the support they deserve. We passed this bill in the Senate in April with broad bipartisan support. Now is the time to get this done.,HER,status
We lost a hero tonight. From his decorated military career to his long-time service for Hawaii  Senator Inouye was a dedicated public servant. He fought for our country on the front lines in WWII despite our government's decision to place his own people--Japanese Americans--in internment camps. Humble to the end  Senator Inouye was and always will be known as a true gentleman in the Senate. Aloha  Senator Inouye.,HER,status
Congratulations to Adrian Peterson and the Vikings on their big 36-22 win today. Peterson ran for 212 yards in one game and is now just 294 yards short of breaking the 1984 record for the most yards in a single season. Congrats Adrian! Here's a photo from training camp this summer.,HER,photo

This morning I gave a speech on the Senate floor about the importance of taking immediate action to avoid the real & negative consequences of the fiscal cliff. We need a balanced approach that includes extending tax cuts for the middle class while returning to the Clinton levels for those making over $250 000  which would reduce the debt by almost $1 trillion. We need to come together to find a solution that gives middle-class families & businesses the certainty they need.,HER,status
Great news: Three of my amendments to fight sexual assault in the military passed and will be part of the Senate defense bill. Until last year records of sexual assault were frequently destroyed  making it difficult for victims to pursue justice. These amendments continue the effort I led last year to ensure these records are preserved and give victims the support they need and deserve.,HER,status
Breaking: Just spoke on the Senate floor about my amendments to the defense bill that would give victims of sexual assault in the military better access to their records. Last year with the support of all 17 women senators  I led the effort to preserve these records for 50 years. Now I am working with Sen. Snowe to make improvements & ensure that our service members get the decency of a fair trial & fair access to records.,HER,status
This election we heard loud & clear from people on both sides of the aisle–they want more cooperation & less gridlock. One way to do that is to reform the Senate filibuster rules. Here’s a proposal: If a member of Congress wants to stop a bill  they shouldn’t just be able to put in a filibuster and go home for the weekend. They should have to stand there and make their argument…and stand there…and stand there…and stand there. That’s called a standing filibuster. Because I know one thing – once they start having to explain to America why they’re doing it  they’ll stop & we'll be able to make progress on legislation that matters to Americans.,HER,status
The new senators are here for their orientation this week! With our record number of 20 women senators we had the first-ever traffic jam in the women senators' restroom. Some records are just meant to be broken. This is a good group that is ready to get to work for our country.,HER,status

Yesterday former Gov. Carlson made good arguments against the voter ID amendment in his debate. http://bit.ly/R89WAZ Here are the four reasons I am voting no on the voter ID amendment: 1.

This isn't necessary. 4. Why put this in the Constitution? Please read up on this and join me in voting no on this and the marriage amendment.,HER,status

Tasmania has been recognised as the greatest destination in the country at the Qantas Australian Tourism Awards.  Tasmanian operators won more medals than any other state or territory  including seven gold  nine silver and three bronze at the gala awards event in Melbourne last night.  This success is testament to our tourism operators. Their hard-work  originality and talent has created experiences that are now rightly recognised as the best in the nation.  It is also a stunning advertisement for Tasmania  and will give even more travellers reason to see for themselves why Tasmania is Australia’s must see destination.,HER,photo

Today we announced the 2015 Barnardos  Australia Mother of the Year – Lisa King.   One of three amazing Tasmanian mums nominated  Lisa continues to be the rock of her family despite losing both a son and a husband.   Lisa will represent our state  – and all our wonderful mums – at the national awards in Sydney on Mother's Day.   The Tasmanian Government is proud to support these awards  and the work of Barnardos – a remarkable global phenomenon that has been helping children and families in Australia for over 130 years.   While people often instinctively think of my father as being my role model  it was my mother who put a guitar in my hands and inspired my lifelong love of music; who let me loose in the kitchen to pursue my passion for cooking; who looked after me and my sisters with her husband  our father   so often away from home for work; and who encouraged me to travel to the UK  where I worked in child protection and social services  supporting mothers and their children who were victims of family violence and neglect.     I was very fortunate  compared with so many who suffer hardship and unimaginable challenges in their lives – like the three extraordinary women nominated for this award.  But I am reminded of  and so grateful for  the great influence my mother was in my life  and in shaping my future,HER,photo

Leo Schofield's comments are derogatory  ignorant and right out of step with what the vast majority of people are saying about Tasmania.  We have record numbers of tourists visiting the state  which has been ranked in the top four 2015 "must see" destinations in the world by Lonely Planet.  Tourism Australia chose Tasmania to host its prestigious "Invite the World to Dinner" event at MONA - Museum of Old and New Art  a truly world class arts attraction and we support many other exceptional events and festivals.  We have the best boutique hotel in the world  our whisky is voted amongst the best in the world  and the best Australian novelist of our time  Tasmanian author Richard Flanagan  has won the Man Booker prize for the best novel in the world.  The Liberal Government is a strong supporter of the arts and while we were disappointed that Mr Schofield chose to leave the state after being offered the exact same amount of public funding for his event  there is much more to celebrate and look forward to in Tasmania.,HER,status

Congratulations to Matt Keogh and his team on the outstanding result for Labor in the Canning by-election.   It is clear that thousands of Western Australians have voted Labor for the first time.   Matt ran a positive campaign which reflected the issues that matter to his local community.   His campaign helped bring down a first-term Prime Minister.   Because of Labor’s campaign a safe Liberal seat has become a marginal one and the Liberal Party - led by Malcolm Turnbull and Julie Bishop - cut down their Prime Minister   Voters in Canning have sent Malcolm Turnbull a clear message: the Liberals changing leaders changed little.   The result is a strong rejection of the Abbott/Turnbull Government’s cuts and broken promises.  This result is a strong endorsement of Labor's commitment to Australian jobs and our concerns about details of the China Free Trade Agreement.

There is an absolutely clear cut choice between Labor and the Liberals when it comes to renewable energy.  Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey hate wind farms; Labor will ensure renewable energy is a big part of the future for our country.

Of all the things this Government has done  putting a new tax on families suffering breakdown is one of the most cruel.

People involved in family violence and child abuse cases will be hurt the most  as their cases typically involve a greater number of subpoenas to be filed  now with greater fees imposed.

He should know that his attacks on working people and their conditions only strengthen our resolve.

“If you want to change the world for yourself and your own kids  you've got to change it for and with other people  particularly  women.” - Vale Joan Kirner,HER,photo
Joan Kirner’s death deeply saddens us all.   From her father Keith  a fitter and turner  Joan took a deep faith in social justice.   From her mother Beryl  a music teacher  she learned to believe women could do anything.    Those two powerful principles defined her always: a dauntless warrior for social democracy and a leader of the march of women through the institutions of power.   Joan Kirner’s was a life lived for the transformative power of education: as a community advocate  parliamentarian  Minister and Premier of Victoria.    When she graduated from the University of Melbourne  Joan became a teacher at Ballarat Technical School.   When she married her husband Ron two years later  she became automatically ineligible for a permanent teaching contract.   It was an act of unfairness she never forgot and a marker of the inequality she dedicated her life to overturning.  Joan looked at politics and  refused to accept the status quo.    A fairer and better deal for women  for teachers  for schools and for students drove her.   As Joan once said:  “If you want to change the world for yourself and your own kids  you've got to change it for and with other people  particularly  women.”  This was the belief that brought her to Parliament and gave her the strength to become Premier of Victoria. It was the deep faith she kept and the Labor cause she served  all her days.    Labor honours the memory of this remarkable woman.   As the first woman Premier of Victoria  she was a mentor and an inspiration for so many women  including Australia's first woman Prime Minister Julia Gillard.  Countless Australian women - and men - will be feeling poorer for her passing.    Joan had a wicked sense of humour  she hated pomposity and she loved the Bombers.  We salute Joan Kirner’s decades of selfless service  passionate advocacy and unconquerable resolve.   We offer our deepest condolences to her family  her husband Ron  children Michael  David  and Kate  Michael’s partner Madeleine  her grandchildren Ned  Sam  Xanthe and Joachim  and everyone who loved her.  May she rest in peace.,HER,status

Our best hopes have been dashed and our worst fears realised.  Labor condemns the execution of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran  in the strongest possible terms.  We extend our heartfelt condolences to all who mourn the loss of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran.  A decade ago  these two young men made a dreadful mistake. By all accounts they spent every minute since seeking to mend their ways and to steer others on the road to redemption. Proof the justice system could reform wrongdoers  not just punish wrongdoing.  Yet today  they were made to pay for one stupid decision of ten years ago with their lives.  Indonesia has not just robbed two young men of their lives but robbed itself of two examples of the strengths of its justice system.    These executions significantly weaken Indonesia’s ability to plead mercy for its own citizens facing execution around the world.  As a close friend and neighbour of Indonesia  Australia is deeply hurt that our pleas for mercy were ignored.  It was completely unacceptable for Indonesia to proceed as it did when critical legal processes were yet to run their course  raising serious questions about Indonesia’s commitment to the rule of law.  Indonesia’s actions demand a strong response from the Australian Government.  Mr Chan and Mr Sukumaran committed a terrible crime. They deserved serious punishment  but not this.  This morning’s news will fall heavily on the many hardworking and courageous people working for their cause.   We acknowledge also the tireless efforts of our diplomatic corps  our embassy staff in Indonesia and the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister.  At all times  the Australian government and opposition have worked together and stood united  against the death penalty and in pursuit of clemency.  Labor opposes the death penalty in every circumstance  in every country. Its continued existence diminishes us all.

Today Australian Cricket has lost a legend  Australia has lost an icon and Australians have lost a dear friend.   The most decent of men and the voice of all our summers has left us.     Richie Benaud was a captain his whole life: a leader on the field  a cool head in the tumult of World Series Cricket and the doyen of the commentary box.    Generations of Australian cricket lovers owe their passion for the game to Richie Benaud’s eloquence  his dry wit  his brilliant mind and his seemingly limitless store of anecdotes and remembrances.    In a profession that can lend itself to hyperbole and histrionics  Richie was always an island of calm understatement. When he spoke  we listened. For millions of Australians  Richie Benaud was cricket – the personification of our noble game.    Long before he spoke to us in our lounge rooms  Richie was already an icon. A dashing all-rounder  striking boundaries and bowling leg-breaks with his hair slicked back and shirt unbuttoned.    From young tyro  Richie became a courageous captain whose daring and sportsmanship helped revive and enrich test match cricket.    Age never diminished Richie  it strengthened him. Sadly now it has taken him from us.     Richie will be mourned by millions  not just in Australia but right around the world  no-one will miss him more than the wife and family he adored so deeply  our hearts go out to them today.

Tony Abbott must end the uncertainty today and accept the Clean Energy Council's compromise for the sake of Australian jobs and a strong economy.,HER,photo

Tony Abbott has cut more than $50 billion from Australian hospitals  threatened a new GP Tax and slashed funding for preventative health initiatives.   To help Australia's health system cope with this  Labor will today launch a new preventative health campaign – An Onion A Day Keeps the Doctor Away.  The multi-layered campaign will raise awareness of the ongoing health benefits of consuming raw onions.   The campaign will also bust the myth that onions are best consumed cooked and with the skin removed.   Research suggests that not only does eating raw onions ward off disease  it has been shown to make you up to three per cent more popular.   The campaign will seek well known “Allium Ambassadors” to use their profile to break down the unwarranted stigma that’s often associated with randomly picking up a raw onion and taking a big bite out of it  like its an apple.   More information on the campaign will be available shortly.,HER,status

Today Tony Abbott dodged a leadership spill but the Liberals remain deeply divided.   What they don’t understand is that it’s what they stand for that’s the problem  not the salesperson.  What matters to Australians are its unfair policies - $100 000 degrees  the GP Tax and cuts to the pension.   The Liberals unfair Budget and their broken promises are hurting Australians – to the tune of $6000 a year for a typical family.   The only way to change this unfair Budget  is to change the Government.,HER,video
Tony Abbott promised he would run a stable and united government. This is his biggest broken promise yet.   The Liberal Government is in paralysis – and Australian families and the Australian economy are paying the price for its chaos.   The Liberal Government has launched an unprecedented attack on low and middle income Australians through:   - A new GP Tax - An increased petrol tax - $100 000 university degrees - Cuts to pensions and family support - $80 billion in cuts to schools and hospitals  Every single member of the Abbott Cabinet voted to support this unfair and destructive Budget.

Labor is deeply saddened by the news that much loved author Colleen McCullough has passed away.   Colleen began her writing career with an act of youthful rebellion.   "So I went to town with the five pounds to buy an overcoat  and I saw a bluebird portable typewriter for five pounds so I bought that instead " she said.   Her impulse purchase immeasurably enriched the literary landscape of our nation and the world.   Colleen wrote her first novel while she was a medical researcher and lived a life renowned for art  literature  science and community service in a unique and unprecedented way.   Young people who were captivated by The Thorn Birds are parents and grandparents now - watching new generations fall in love with Colleen's evocative word pictures and the clarity of her prose.

This morning  we lost a giant of Australia and a Leviathan of the Labor movement.   Our light on the hill dims darker with this sad news.   Tom Uren spent his long life protecting the working class and fighting for social justice.   On a day when we celebrate the best of Australia  we can proudly say that Tom really was the best of us.   Tom saw the worst of war and fought to build the best of civilisation after that war – as a unionist  a civil libertarian and a Labor Minister.   His reimagining and reconfiguring of inner Sydney  a great book  a lifetime of working class  social democratic values and a humble civility are among his enduring monuments.   Tom was the keeper of Labor’s conscience in trying times. He was our moral centre.   He was a prisoner of war  but he only ever pursued peace.   He knew hardship  but he never succumbed to hatred.   The late Neville Wran told us that Balmain boys don’t cry  but many will shed a tear today – for Tom and for what we’ve lost.   Our thoughts today with his family.     May Tom rest in peace  and may we continue to learn from his peerless example.,HER,status
Today  we celebrate our national day. We celebrate what Australia means to us. We celebrate our freedom  our tolerance and most importantly for me  our multiculturalism.

Whether Australia was their dream  or their last resort  today we honour their contribution.  Happy Australia Day everyone,HER,photo
On behalf of the Australian Labor Party  I have the special privilege of congratulating Rosie Batty on being named the 2015 Australian of the Year.   Today we honour the bravery  selflessness and unconquerable sprit of a remarkable woman.   Rosie Batty should not have had to become Australian of the Year. That terrible act of violence should never have happened.   We all know Rosie and Luke’s story now because Rosie refused to yield to the silence  ambivalence and acceptance that too often shrouds family violence.   Australians have marveled at Rosie’s courage  and we have drawn new faith from her strength.   Through the worst heartbreak and devastation  Rosie forced all of us to confront family violence as a national  public issue. In doing so  she has become an inspiration for all of us.    Rosie is honoured today on behalf of the thousands of women and children who  right now  suffer the scourge of family violence.   The existence of family violence in modern Australia is our shared shame  and its total elimination is our shared challenge.   As we recognise Rosie’s contribution to our nation  let us also renew our commitment to eliminating family violence from our national life.     Tonight we also congratulate Jackie French for being named Senior Australian of the Year  Drisana Levitzke-Gray for being named Young Australian of the Year  and Juliette Wright for being named Australia’s 2015 Local Hero.   We also thank Adam Goodes for his service as the 2014 Australian of the Year.   In their own endeavours  these exceptional men and women have bettered our nation  and they reflect the best of us.

This is a time to look back at what we’ve achieved in 2014  and look ahead to the challenges in 2015.   Too often in 2014  tragedy touched our lives  and the resolve of the Australian people was tested. In times of horror  shock and grief  we came together. We refused to give in to adversity  or surrender to ignorance and intolerance.We responded to division with unity; to fear with strength. In our darkest moments  Australians displayed the best of the human spirit.   In 2015  Labor will continue to stand up for ordinary people and fight for a fairer Australia. We’ll keep fighting for good jobs  accessible healthcare and affordable education. We’ll keeping fighting the Government’s cost of living increases through cuts to child care  cuts to pensions and unfair taxes. We’ll keep supporting the march of Australian women through the institutions of power  and we’ll keep providing a strong voice for our regions. We will keep talking to Australians about our vision for their future. And most importantly  we will keep listening.   I’m also determined to use this new year to finally resolve a process to recognise our first Australians in the Constitution.This is the challenge of our generation  and one we cannot abdicate.   And in a few months  all Australians will pause to commemorate the centenary of the Anzac landing at Gallipoli. We will honour the thousands who fell on those fatal shores  and the thousands more who have since paid the ultimate sacrifice in service to their country.   And we’ll be reminded that Australia’s best hope has always been its people.   Best wishes to you and your family for 2015.,HER,status

A relentless pursuer of reform.    A custodian of the Light on the Hill and the best example of the Whitlam tradition.    We honour John’s service today  but we don’t say goodbye.   I know that John’s contribution to our cause is far from finished. Labor and Australia still need John Faulkner.   Our nation and our movement have been made better because of John Faulkner.,HER,status

STATEMENT - NELSON MANDELA  On behalf of the Federal Opposition  we pay tribute to Nelson Mandela  unarguably one of the greatest global figures of our time.   Today we have lost a light of our world.   In fractious and troubled times  Mandela led his nation out of the dark age of apartheid – not with a violent struggle  but with peace  compassion and a force of moral leadership.   Mandela knew his country could never be healed with violence or vengeance. He suffered so his people could be free.   Mandela was a true leader  a statesman  and the defining symbol of reconciliation.   He achieved perhaps more than any other leader in his pursuit of peace  acceptance and justice.   The slow struggle for reconciliation does not end today – not for South Africa  and not for any of us.   Let today renew our resolve for reconciliation. Mandela was an example to the world – we must live by that example.   Our thoughts and prayers are with his family  his country  and all who looked to him in hope for a better world.   We are better because of Mandela. May he rest in peace.   LABOR LEADER  THE HON. BILL SHORTEN MP DEPUTY LABOR LEADER  THE HON. TANYA PLIBERSEK MP,HER,status

In July this year I had the honour of representing Australia in our case before the International Court of Justice at The Hague in the Netherlands.    One part of Australia’s argument was that whale research can be conducted in a non-lethal manner  such as by placing satellite tracking devices on whales  a technique that Australian scientists have pioneered.   I visited Australian Antarctic Division HQ just last week to see first-hand the non-lethal research methods our scientists are developing.  The satellite tracking dart is fired into the thick blubber of a Blue Whale and sends vital data about the whale’s movements back to HQ. Smaller darts are used for Minke Whales.
