Latest News: Hubble shows a rare view of a pair of overlapping galaxies  called NGC 3314. The two galaxies look as if they are colliding  but they are actually separated by tens of millions of light-years  or about ten times the distance between our Milky Way and the neighboring Andromeda galaxy. The chance alignment of the two galaxies  as seen from Earth  gives a unique look at the silhouetted spiral arms in the closer face-on spiral  NGC 3314A.   http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2012/29/,HER,photo

Picture Post: Stephan's Quintet  also known as Hickson Compact Group 92  is a group of five galaxies. The name  however  is a bit of a misnomer. Studies have shown that group member NGC 7320  at upper left  is actually a foreground galaxy about seven times closer to Earth than the rest of the group.  Three of the galaxies have distorted shapes  elongated spiral arms  and long  gaseous tidal tails containing myriad star clusters  proof of their close encounters. These interactions have sparked a frenzy of star birth in the central pair of galaxies. This drama is being played out against a rich backdrop of faraway galaxies.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2009/2009/25/image/x/,HER,photo

Yesterday  sky watchers around the NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville  Alabama  witnessed something amazing: A complex network of luminous arcs and rings surrounded the afternoon sun. "I've never seen anything quite like it " says eyewitness Bill Cooke  head of NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office. Solar physicist David Hathaway snapped this picture of the display.   The apparition is almost certainly connected to hurricane Sandy. The core of the storm swept well north of Alabama  but Sandy's outer bands did pass over the area  leaving behind a thin haze of ice crystals in cirrus clouds. Sunlight shining through the crystals produced an unusually rich variety of ice halos.  Credit: NASA/MSFC David Hathaway / Spaceweather.com,HER,photo

Reflections on a Mote of Dust  by Carl Sagan   We succeeded in taking that picture [from deep space]  and  if you look at it  you see a dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it  everyone you ever heard of  every human being who ever lived  lived out their lives. The aggregate of all our joys and sufferings  thousands of confident religions  ideologies and economic doctrines  every hunter and forager  every hero and coward  every creator and destroyer of civilizations  every king and peasant  every young couple in love  every hopeful child  every mother and father  every inventor and explorer  every teacher of morals  every corrupt politician  every superstar  every supreme leader  every saint and sinner in the history of our species  lived there on a mote of dust  suspended in a sunbeam.  The earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that in glory and in triumph they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of the dot on scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner of the dot. How frequent their misunderstandings  how eager they are to kill one another  how fervent their hatreds. Our posturings  our imagined self-importance  the delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe  are challenged by this point of pale light.  Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity -- in all this vastness -- there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves. It is up to us. It's been said that astronomy is a humbling  and I might add  a character-building experience. To my mind  there is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me  it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly and compassionately with one another and to preserve and cherish that pale blue dot  the only home we've ever known.  Original image: http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00450,HER,photo

Welcome to a Week of Hubble Art on Facebook. Each day we're posting an artist's illustration that depicts a discovery from one of Hubble's news releases. Enjoy!  This planet  estimated to be at least seven times Jupiter's mass  was originally discovered in images taken with the Keck and Gemini North telescopes in 2007 and 2008. It is the outermost of three massive planets known to orbit the dusty young star HR 8799  which is 130 light-years away. Astronomers combing though years of archived Hubble data were able to identify this planet  which went undiscovered in Hubble images taken in 1998.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2009/15/full/,HER,photo

Picture Post: An eerie pillar of star birth in the Carina Nebula rises from a sea of greenish-colored clouds. Nestled inside this dense structure are fledgling stars. They cannot be seen in this image because they are hidden by a wall of gas and dust. Although the stars themselves are invisible  one of them is providing evidence of its existence. Thin puffs of material can be seen traveling to the left and to the right of a dark notch in the center of the pillar. The matter is part of a jet produced by a young star. Farther away  on the left  the jet is visible as a grouping of small  wispy clouds. A few small clouds are visible at a similar distance on the right side of the jet. Astronomers estimate that the jet is moving at speeds of up to 850 000 miles an hour. The jet's total length is about 10 light-years.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/solar%20system/2009/25/image/h/,HER,photo

Picture Post: These Hubble snapshots capture merging galaxies at various stages in their collision. Astronomers estimate that only one out of one thousand galaxies in the nearby universe is in the act of colliding. However  galaxy mergers were much more common long ago when they were closer together  because the expanding universe was smaller.   For all their violence  galactic smash-ups take place at a glacial rate by human standards - timescales on the order of several hundred million years.   http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2008/16/,HER,photo

Choice quotes from Col. Chris Hadfield during his news conference (paraphrased):  "On the ISS  when you have 30 seconds free  you go do something else!"  "It's a whole new normal  my body was perfectly happy living in space... My body is catching up with the change."  "We're learning about the fundamental nature of matter because the ISS exists."  "People followed me because there is poetry and purpose in what is happening on the ISS."  "I'm not a person who looks back and wishes that my past was my present."  "In the gym yesterday  it felt like someone was squeezing me down into the floor  felt like it was so unfair!"  "Zero gravity is like a superpower!"  "We are working hard to make the most out of the taxpayer's dollar and make the ISS a fabric of the lives of Canadians."   "I don't have a callouses on the bottom of my feet yet  I'm walking around like an infant."  "CSA's Microflow tested to show how space tech can help remote communities with things like blood testing."  "We're also inspiring our youth to do something that barely seems possible."  On his landing: "We could smell spring  the charred spacecraft  growing grass wafting through the open door."  "In 2001  ISS was barely functional  only 1 lab  it was just getting going. The reason we put Canadarm2 on was to build ISS."  "The number of people following is a measure of the number of people who shared the experience."  "My advice: turn yourself into what you want to become step by step as a demonstration of personal will."  On his favourite photo he took in space: "Most proud of the pic of the Sun over Indian ocean  noctilucent clouds  revealing how our upper atmosphere works.",HER,status

Latest News: New observations by #Hubble reveal a new twist on the Ring Nebula. The images show a more complex structure than astronomers once thought.  "The nebula is not like a bagel  but rather  it's like a jelly doughnut  because it's filled with material in the middle " said C. Robert O'Dell of Vanderbilt University in Nashville  Tenn. "With Hubble's detail  we see a completely different shape than what's been thought about historically for this classic nebula. The new Hubble observations show the nebula in much clearer detail  and we see things are not as simple as we previously thought."  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2013/13/,HER,photo

Picture Post: This image is from a seven-day-long survey conducted in 2006 called the Sagittarius Window Eclipsing Extrasolar Planet Search (SWEEPS). Hubble peered at and obtained information for 180 000 stars in the crowded central bulge of our galaxy  26 000 light-years away. The survey was intended to find hot Jupiter-class planets that orbit very close to their stars. But the SWEEPS team also uncovered 42 oddball blue stars among the bulge population with brightness and temperatures typical for stars much younger than ordinary bulge stars.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/star/2011/16/,HER,photo

On this day: 19 February 1473  Nicolaus Copernicus was born in the city of Toruń (Thorn) in Poland. Copernicus was the Renaissance mathematician and astronomer who formulated the 'heliocentric model' of the Solar System which placed the Sun  rather than Earth  at the centre. The publication of his book  'De revolutionibus orbium coelestium' (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres)  just before his death in 1543  is considered a major event in the history of science - beginning the Copernican Revolution and contributing importantly to the scientific revolution (the emergence of modern science).,HER,photo

This #ThrowbackThursday is for all of you Trekkies out there! Pictured here are Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry and some of the principle television cast in front of the Space Shuttle Enterprise at the dedication ceremony on September 17th  1976.  Enterprise was originally planned to be named Constitution and unveiled on Constitution Day (September 17th). However  a letter-writing campaign by Trekkies to the White House changed that when they asked that the orbiter be named after the Starship Enterprise  featured on the television show Star Trek.   Although the Enterprise never flew in space  it was used to test critical phases of landing and other aspects of shuttle preparations. The shuttle was mounted on top of a modified 747 airliner and released over the dry lakebed at Edwards Air Force Base  California to prove it could glide and land safely.

A suite of NASA's Sun-gazing spacecraft have spotted an unusual series of eruptions in which a series of fast puffs forced the slow ejection of a massive burst of solar material from the Sun's atmosphere. The eruptions took place over a period of three days  starting on Jan. 17  2013. Nathalia Alzate  a solar scientist at the University of Aberystwyth in Wales  presented findings on what caused the puffs at the 2014 Royal Astronomical Society's National Astronomy Meeting in Portsmouth  England.  The sun's outermost atmosphere  the corona  is made of magnetized solar material  called plasma  that has a temperature of millions of degrees and extends millions of miles into space. On January 17  the joint European Space Agency and NASA's Solar and Heliospheric Observatory  or SOHO  spacecraft observed puffs emanating from the base of the corona and rapidly exploding outwards into interplanetary space. The puffs occurred roughly once every three hours. After about 12 hours  a much larger eruption of material began  apparently eased out by the smaller-scale explosions.  By looking at high-resolution images taken by NASA's NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory (Little SDO)  or SDO  and NASA's Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory  or STEREO  over the same time period and in different wavelengths  Alzate and her colleagues could focus on the cause of the puffs and the interaction between the small and large-scale eruptions.  "Looking at the corona in extreme ultraviolet light we see the source of the puffs is a series of energetic jets and related flares " said Alzate. "The jets are localized  catastrophic releases of energy that spew material out from the sun into space. These rapid changes in the magnetic field cause flares  which release a huge amount of energy in a very short time in the form of super-heated plasma  high-energy radiation and radio bursts. The big  slow structure is reluctant to erupt  and does not begin to smoothly propagate outwards until several jets have occurred."  Because the events were observed by multiple spacecraft  each viewing the sun from a different perspective  Alzate and her colleagues were able to resolve the three-dimensional configuration of the eruptions. This allowed them to estimate the forces acting on the slow eruption and discuss possible mechanisms for the interaction between the slow and fast phenomena.  "We still need to understand whether there are shock waves  formed by the jets  passing through and driving the slow eruption " said Alzate. "Or whether magnetic reconfiguration is driving the jets allowing the larger  slow structure to slowly erupt. Thanks to recent advances in observation and in image processing techniques we can throw light on the way jets can lead to small and fast  or large and slow  eruptions from the Sun."  Image info:  This combination of three wavelengths of light from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory shows one of the multiple jets that led to a series of slow coronal puffs on January 17  2013.

******GMO: follow-follow-up***** August 6th  2014  Interesting to see the range of reaction to my GMO remarks. One blog proclaimed "Tyson tells Liberals to Chill Out". When in fact I never mentioned anything about politics or political affiliations at all. Other blogs proclaimed that I supported GMOs  asking if I was paid by Monsanto. And in other places  the reaction could only be described as virulent.  I maintain the sense  thrust  and meaning of my comments.  In fact -- apart from my "chill out" quip in the video  which clearly deserved further explanation -- I didn't really vote one way or another on GMOs. You want to distinguish how genes are modified? Okay  then label everything  and create two subcategories of GMO. One that indicates laboratory and one that indicates agriculture. I said this explicitly in my Facebook post.  Furthermore  I never said GMOs were safer or more dangerous. I implied that if you think GMO-laboratory is **inherently** more dangerous to human life than GMO-agriculture you are simply wrong. They both can be bad for the environment. They both can be less healthy. They both can disrupt the local flora and fauna. But both methods wield an awesome power to improve food in every way that matters to humans: yields  appearance  vitamin content  sweetness  resistance to insects  resistance to weather extremes  and so forth.  As in all new foods  transgenic or otherwise  they should be tested for safety. [how many times do I need to say that?] And they should be tested for their effect on the environment. If the regulatory system is failing at this then it should be modified. And if the tests indicate a risk to the health of some humans and a benefit to others  then this should appear on the labeling. By the way  we already do this for peanuts  to protect people from peanut allergies. But there's no talk of banning them.  I note  of course  that we don't do this for wheat - a fully domesticated  genetically modified food. Yet many people suffer from wheat (gluten) allergies. Meanwhile foods that contain gluten display no explicit warnings at all. You just know that you're not supposed to buy and eat that baguette if you suffer from this condition.  Imagine if today  scientists showed you the Aurochs Wild Ox  and said -- "Give us time. In just a few years  we will genetically modify this wild animal  turning it into a different sub species whose sole purpose is to provide vast quantities of milk for humans to drink. They will produce 10x as much milk as did the original animal. But they will require vast grasslands to sustain. And some of you will get sick because you won't be able to digest the lactose. But no need to label this fact. People will just figure this out on their own. The rest of you will be fine. We'll call the result a Holstein Milk Cow."  What would anti GMO-laboratory people say this story? Would they embrace it or reject it? Of course  over the past 10 000 years  this is exactly what we've done to that Ox - or whatever is the agreed-upon origin of the domesticated Cow. Call it GMO-agriculture. If you reject GMOs you fundamentally reject it all.  Finally  I found it odd that people presumed I was taking sides. As an educator  my priority is to make sure people are informed -- accurately and honestly. For the purposes of general enlightenment  but especially before drawing policy or legislation that could affect us all.  I have nothing more to add. Or to subtract. On to other topics for me.  -Neil deGrasse Tyson,HER,status

On August 24  2014  the sun emitted a mid-level solar flare  peaking at 8:16 a.m. EDT.  Here are some captured images of the flare  which erupted on the left side of the sun. Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation. Harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth's atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground  however -- when intense enough -- they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where GPS and communications signals travel.  This flare is classified as an M5 flare. M-class flares are ten times less powerful than the most intense flares  called X-class flares.

So with all this talk about this X1.6-class solar flare  the coronal mass ejection on its way and the term space weather  I thought it might be helpful to share this with you. Should I share more information about space weather today? Let me know your thoughts.   The Sun and its atmosphere consist of several zones  or layers  from the inner core to the outer corona. Beyond the corona is the solar wind  which is an outward expansion of coronal plasma that extends well beyond the orbit of Pluto. This entire region of space influenced by the Sun is called the heliosphere.   Controlled by the Earth's magnetic field  the magnetosphere acts as a shield protecting the planet from solar wind. The shape of the Earth's magnetosphere is the direct result of being impacted by solar wind  compressed on its sunward side and elongated on the night-side  the magnetotail. The shock wave where the solar wind encounters Earth's magnetosphere is called the bow shock  which slows and diverts the solar wind. Solar activity lead to solar eruptions  which includes such phenomena as sunspots  flares  prominences  and coronal mass ejections that influence space weather  or near-Earth environmental conditions.   Modern society depends heavily on a variety of technologies that are susceptible to space weather. Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) for example can cause geomagnetic storms that can disrupt satellite communications and navigational equipment  and even cause blackouts.  Credit: NASA,HER,photo

Latest News: Astronomers have found an unlikely object in an improbable place: a monster black hole lurking inside one of the tiniest galaxies known. The dwarf galaxy containing the black hole  as illustrated in this artist's concept  is the densest galaxy ever seen  cramming 140 million stars within a diameter of about 300 light-years (just 1/500th of our Milky Way galaxy's diameter). However  the black hole inside the galaxy is five times the mass of the black hole at the center of our Milky Way. This suggests that the dwarf galaxy may actually be the stripped remnant of a larger galaxy that was torn apart during a close encounter with a more massive galaxy. The finding implies that there are many other compact galaxies in the universe that contain supermassive black holes. http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2014/41,HER,photo

Our friend Chris asked if I could show the various wavelengths that we are using to observed the Sun. And since I love getting requests  let's take a look! Thanks Chris for the suggestion!   Telescopes help distant objects appear bigger  but this is only one of their advantages. Telescopes can also collect light in ranges that our eyes alone cannot see  providing scientists ways of observing a whole host of material and processes that would otherwise be inaccessible.  A this NASA movie of the Sun based on data from yours truly Little SDO shows the wide range of wavelengths – invisible to the naked eye – that the telescope can view. I convert the wavelengths into an image humans can see  and the light is colorized into a rainbow of colors.  As the colors sweep around the Sun in the movie  viewers should note how different the same area of the Sun appears. This happens because each wavelength of light represents solar material at specific temperatures. Different wavelengths convey information about different components of the Sun's surface and atmosphere  so scientists use them to paint a full picture of our constantly changing and varying star.  Yellow light of 5800 Angstroms  for example  generally emanates from material of about 10 000 degrees F (5700 degrees C)  which represents the surface of the Sun.   Extreme ultraviolet light of 94 Angstroms  which is typically colorized in green in my images  comes from atoms that are about 11 million degrees F (6 300 000 degrees C) and is a good wavelength for looking at solar flares  which can reach such high temperatures. By examining pictures of the Sun in a variety of wavelengths – as is done not only by me  but also by NASA's Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph  NASA's Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory and the European Space Agency/NASA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory -- scientists can track how particles and heat move through the Sun's atmosphere.

It's been a while since we looked at Today's Sun; and here is our Sun on October 1  2014.   These are three images put into a composite so we are actually seeing three different but very similar temperatures  highlighting a different part of the solar corona. The three wavelengths combined are:  211 Angstroms  showing temperatures of  2 million K (3.6 million F)  193 Angstroms  showing temperatures of  1.25 million K (2.25 million F)  171 Angstroms  showing temperatures of 1 million K (1.8 million F)  We are seeing a lot of beautiful events happening in this image. The bright areas are active regions. On the right side of the Sun we are seeing several areas which harbor the energy for some medium sized solar flares.   You can also see the coronal loops  those large arches coming out of the surface of the Sun and looping back down. These are tens of thousands of miles long.   Can you see that dark band on the upper right? That's a filament and it's at least a couple hundred thousand miles long. Filaments are elongated clouds of plasma tethered above the Sun's surface by powerful magnetic forces. Filaments are notoriously unstable. They appear darker when viewed in extreme ultraviolet light because they are somewhat cooler than the underlying material.  There never is a boring moment up there! Hope all is well where you are too!?  Credit: NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory (Little SDO),HER,photo

Space Weather is more complex than it seem. Another source are the High Speed Streams in the Solar Wind.  A high speed stream (HSS) is like a powerful gust in the solar wind. Near the edge of a HSS are regions of high particle density and strong magnetic fields while inside the stream the density and field are low and the temperature and velocity are high.   The flow velocity inside a HSS can reach 300 to 1000 km/s. In some cases they will produce interplanetary shocks. High speed streams come from coronal holes  dark regions in the solar corona  and are most common during the declining phase of the solar cycle. High-speed streams can last a long time and we often see a HSS every 27 days as its home coronal hole rotates into the right position. Because coronal holes do not align with sunspots or active regions and could only be seen once coronal images from space were available  the origin of high speed streams was originally assigned to M-regions.

I captured a splendid example of expanding coronal loops seen in profile at the edge of the Sun (October 14-15  2014).    The bright loops began to form and grow after a long-lasting M-class flare erupted. The images we see in extreme ultraviolet light are actually particles spiraling along magnetic field lines arcing above the active region that was the source of the flare. They are reorganizing the magnetic field after its disruption. To give a sense of scale  these huge loops are reaching out more than 15 times the size of Earth.

The Sun blew out a powerful coronal mass ejection (CME) from just around the edge of the Sun (Oct. 14  2014). The particle cloud expanded around all the Sun in a rough circle  hence the name 'halo' CME. This event was also associated with a fairly strong flare. The active region that was the source of these events is just rotating into view. Then  we can better observe its size and structure. The bright object to the right and just above the Sun is Venus now on the far side of the Sun.   Credit: NASA/ESA/SOHO,HER,video
Active Region AR2192 continues to be impressive. By now the largest sunspot in this solar cycle  this active region produced eight M-class solar flares and one X-class solar flare. And since the X1.1-class solar flare from Saturday  October 19  2014  this region has doubled in size.  Here is a look at the development of this region as it started to rotated over the eastern limb of the Sun and into our view here.  This is from the data from my HMI instrument. It is designed to study oscillations and the magnetic field at the solar surface  or photosphere. HMI is one of three instruments on board. HMI observes the full solar disk at 6173 angstroms.

NASA Identifies Ice Cloud Above Cruising Altitude on Titan  NASA scientists have identified an unexpected high-altitude methane ice cloud on Saturn's moon Titan that is similar to exotic clouds found far above Earth's poles.  This lofty cloud  imaged by NASA's Cassini spacecraft  was part of the winter cap of condensation over Titan's north pole. Now  eight years after spotting this mysterious bit of atmospheric fluff  researchers have determined that it contains methane ice  which produces a much denser cloud than the ethane ice previously identified there.

And here we go again! An X3.1-class flare erupted from the lower half of the Sun on October 24  2014  peaking at 21:40 UT. This image of the flare was captured by NASA's SDO and it shows extreme ultraviolet light in the 304 and 171 Angstrom wavelengths.   his flare is classified as an X3.1-class flare. X-class denotes the most intense flares  while the number provides more information about its strength. An X2 is twice as intense as an X1  an X3 is three times as intense  etc.  The flare erupted from a particularly large active region -- labeled AR 12192 -- on the sun that is the largest in 24 years. This is the fourth substantial flare from this active region since October 19  2014.   Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation. Harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth's atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground  however -- when intense enough -- they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where GPS and communications signals travel.

A couple of days ago I posted a still image of the large active region AR2192 in the 171 angstroms view. You could see the coronal loops so very well.   Here is now a movie from October 26 covering about 50 hours. Look how this region continues to rotate towards the western limb of the Sun and at the same time also producing solar flares.   What's really beautiful is the interaction of all the coronal loops. Coronal loops are found around sunspots and in active regions. These structures are associated with the closed magnetic field lines that connect magnetic regions on the solar surface. Many coronal loops last for days or weeks  but most change quite rapidly.  Maybe it's just me  but I could look at this all day long! Well  I actually am... 24/7!   Credit: NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory (Little SDO),HER,video

'Ghost Light' from Dead Galaxies encountered by Hubble  NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope has picked up the faint  ghostly glow of stars ejected from ancient galaxies that were gravitationally ripped apart several billion years ago. The mayhem happened 4 billion light-years away  inside an immense collection of nearly 500 galaxies nicknamed “Pandora’s Cluster ” also known as Abell 2744.  The scattered stars are no longer bound to any one galaxy  and drift freely between galaxies in the cluster. By observing the light from the orphaned stars  Hubble astronomers have assembled forensic evidence that suggests as many as six galaxies were torn to pieces inside the cluster over a stretch of 6 billion years.

On this day: 8 November 1656  Edmond Halley was born in Shoreditch  London. Halley was the English astronomer and mathematician who is best known for recognising that a bright comet (later named after him) had appeared several times  calculating its orbit (1682) and for successfully predicting its return. After originating the question that prodded Isaac Newton to write his Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica  Halley edited it and arranged its publication. Halley identified the proper motion of stars  studied the Moon's motion and tides  realised that nebulae were clouds of luminous gas among the stars  and that the aurora was a phenomenon connected with Earth's magnetism. His prediction of the transit of Venus led to Cook's voyage to Tahiti. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond_Halley,HER,photo

With the goal in mind of placing a crew on the Moon before 1970  NASA had a lot of questions it needed answered. During Project Mercury two things quickly became apparent; that the Apollo spacecraft would not be ready until the second half of the 1960s  and that the Mercury spacecraft was not capable of answering many of the questions needed to make it to the Moon with Apollo.   The Gemini program became the stepping stone to answer the questions that plagued NASA. Gemini accomplished many objectives: proved that humans could survive long duration flight  perfected rendezvous methods and procedures  worked out spacewalking techniques  and perfected reentry methods.   On this day in 1966  the final Gemini flight  Gemini XII  launched from Cape Canaveral. Gemini 12 was commanded by astronaut Jim Lovell and included multiple EVAs by his crewmate  Buzz Aldrin (as seen in the attached picture). The astronauts also took many photos including pictures of a total solar eclipse while they passed through it over South America. When the final Gemini mission was successfully completed 4 days later  NASA was ready to move on to the Apollo program. Gemini had laid the foundation needed for the Apollo program and human travel to the Moon.

Is Rosetta's Comet Singing? The comet seems to be emitting a ‘song’ in the form of oscillations in the magnetic field in the comet’s environment. It is being sung at 40-50 millihertz  far below human hearing  which typically picks up sound between 20 Hz and 20 kHz. To make the music audible to the human ear  the frequencies have been increased by a factor of about 10 000. Listen in: http://buff.ly/1Erji2G  More background: http://buff.ly/1Erjizy,HER,photo

Astronauts aboard the International Space Station took this photograph of Florida in October 2014. The peninsula is highly recognizable even at night  especially when looking roughly north  as our map-trained brains expect.  Illuminated areas give a strong sense of the size of cities. The brightest continuous patch of lights is the Miami-Fort Lauderdale metropolitan area  the largest urban area in the southeastern U.S. and home to 5.6 million people. The next largest area is the Tampa Bay region (2.8 million people) on the Gulf Coast of the peninsula. Orlando  located in the middle  has a somewhat smaller footprint (2.3 million). A nearly straight line of cities runs nearly 560 kilometers (350 miles) along the Atlantic coast from Jacksonville  Florida  to Wilmington  North Carolina.  South of Orlando  the center and southern portions of the peninsula are as dark as the Atlantic Ocean  vividly illustrating the almost population-free Everglades wetland. The lights of Cocoa Beach trace the curved lines of Cape Canaveral and the Kennedy Space Center  an area well known to astronauts. Dim lights of the Florida Keys extend the arc of the Atlantic coast to the corner of the image. The small cluster of lights far offshore is Freeport on Grand Bahama Island (image right). The faint blue areas throughout the image are clouds lit by moonlight.  #ISS #Earth #Florida,HER,photo

People tend to think of gravity on Earth as uniform and consistent. But in fact  Earth’s gravitational field is subject to variations that occur over time. This is due to a combination of factors  like uneven distributions of mass in the oceans  continents  and deep interior  as well as climate-related variables like the water balance of continents  and the melting or growing of glaciers.  And now  for the first time ever  these variations have been captured in the image known as the “Potsdam Gravity Potato” –  a visualization of the Earth’s gravity field model.

Here is another very nice view of December 4th's M6.1-class solar flare.   The image blends two wavelengths of extreme ultraviolet light – 131 and 171 Angstroms – which are typically colored in teal and gold  respectively.  Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation. Harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth's atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground  however -- when intense enough -- they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where GPS and communications signals travel.  This flare is classified as an M6.1-class flare. M-class flares are a tenth the size of the most intense flares  the X-class flares. The number provides more information about its strength. An M2 is twice as intense as an M1  an M3 is three times as intense  etc.  Credit: NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory (Little SDO),HER,photo

The near-Earth space enviroment is a complex interaction between Earth's magnetic field  cool plasma moving up from Earth's ionosphere  and hotter plasma coming in from the solar wind. This interactions combine to maintain the radiation belts around Earth.  Plasma interactions can generate sharply delineated regions in these belts. In addition to the inner and outer radiation belts  the cooler plasma of the plasmasphere interacts so that it keeps out the higher-energy electrons from outside its boundary (called the plasmapause).  In this visualization  the radiation belts (rainbow-color) and plasmapause (blue-green surface) surround Earth  its structure largely determined by Earth's dipole magnetic field (represented by cyan curved lines). The radiation belt is sliced open  simultaneously revealing representative confined charged particles spiraling around the magnetic field structure. Yellow particles represent negative-charged electrons  blue particles represent positive-charged ions. However  if realistically scaled for particle mass and energies  the spiral motion would not be visible at this distance so particle masses and size scales are adjusted to make them visible.  The inner blue-green plasmapause boundary is then sliced open to reveal more of the inner structure of the radiation belts  including the innermost belt.

Understanding vast systems in space requires understanding what's happening on tiny scales. Giant events can turn out to have tiny drivers -- take  for example  what rocked near-Earth space in October 2003.   On October 28  2003  and again on October 29  massive solar flares erupted on the Sun  sending X-rays zooming through the solar system. Along with the flares  the sun expelled giant clouds of solar material  called coronal mass ejections  or CMEs. The CMEs slammed into Earth's magnetic field pushed material and energy in toward Earth. This created what's called a geomagnetic storm.  The Halloween Storms  as they have come to be called  triggered brilliant aurora that could be seen over much of North America -- reaching as far south as Texas. But they also interfered with GPS signals and radio communications  and caused the Federal Aviation Administration to issue their first ever warning to airlines to avoid excess radiation by flying at low altitudes.  Every step leading to these intense storms -- the flare  the CME  the transfer of energy from the CME to Earth's magnetosphere – was ultimately powered by the catalyst of magnetic reconnection. This little understood process can occur in thin layers just miles thick. Yet it can accelerate particles up to nearly the speed of light and can initiate giant eruptions from the sun many times the size of Earth.  In March 2015  NASA will launch a new mission to study magnetic reconnection. The MMS (Magnetospheric Multiscale) Magnetospheric Multiscale  or MMS  mission will be the first ever mission dedicated to studying this universal process by orbiting Earth to pass directly through nearby magnetic reconnection regions and to observe the minute details of such events.  Reconnection occurs wherever charged gases  called plasma  are present. It's rare on Earth  but plasma makes up 99% of the visible universe. Plasma fuels stars and fills the near vacuum of space. Plasma behave unlike what we regularly experience on Earth because they travel with their own set of magnetic fields entrapped in the material. Changing magnetic fields affect the way charged particles move and vice versa  so the net effect is a complex  constantly-adjusting system that is sensitive to minute variations.  Under normal conditions the magnetic field lines inside plasmas don't break or merge with other field lines. But sometimes  as field lines get close to each other  the entire pattern changes and everything realigns into a new configuration. The amount of energy released can be formidable. Magnetic reconnection taps into the stored energy of the magnetic field  converting it into heat and kinetic energy that sends particles zooming off in all directions.  Scientists want to know exactly what conditions  what tipping points  trigger magnetic reconnection events.  Much of what we currently know about the small-scale physics of magnetic reconnection comes from theoretical studies  computer models  and laboratory experiments. True understanding  however  requires observing magnetic reconnection up close – so MMS will take its measurements in Earth's own magnetosphere  an ideal natural laboratory in which reconnection can be observed under a wide range of conditions.  Orbiting Earth  MMS will travel through known areas of magnetic reconnection. During its first phase it will travel through reconnection sites on the sun side of Earth. Here the interplanetary magnetic field connects with Earth's magnetic field  transferring material  momentum and energy to the magnetosphere via magnetic reconnection. During the second phase of its mission  MMS will observe reconnection on the night side of Earth  where that connected field flows around both sides of Earth to a second reconnection point in what's known as the magnetotail  where they then disconnect.  These reconnection sites are so thin  that MMS will fly through them in under a second -- but the MMS sensors have been built to be fast  operating at unprecedented speed. As the spacecraft fly through such a site  they will measure the magnetic and electric fields present as well as the movement of particles.  Armed with this data  scientists will have their first chance to watch magnetic reconnection from the inside  right as it's occurring. By focusing on the small-scale process  scientists open the door to understanding what happens on larger scales throughout the universe. Determining how reconnection occurs nearby will improve our understanding of how this fundamental process works on the sun  on other stars  throughout space -- and  of course  it will teach us more about giant geomagnetic storms like the Halloween storms  thus helping us safeguard our home planet Earth.

On December 11  1972  Apollo 17 landed on the Moon.  It was the final lunar landing of the Apollo program. The Lunar Module  named Challenger  touched down in the Taurus-Littrow highlands. This site was picked for Apollo 17 because it was a location where rocks--both older and younger--than those previously returned from other Apollo missions were thought likely be found.   Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt conducted three Moonwalks (EVAs as we say here at NASA)  spending more than 22 hours on the lunar surface. They conducted many experiments with the help of the Lunar Roving Vehicle (seen in the picture below) that enabled them to travel greater distances.

The Sun emitted a mid-level solar flare  peaking at 11:50 PM EST on December 16  2014.  I captured an image of the event. Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation. Harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth's atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground  however -- when intense enough -- they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where GPS and communications signals travel.  This flare is classified as an M8.7-class flare. M-class flares are a tenth the size of the most intense flares  the X-class flares. The number provides more information about its strength. An M2 is twice as intense as an M1  an M3 is three times as intense  etc.  Credit: NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory (Little SDO),HER,photo

Auroras are the most visible manifestation of the sun’s effect on Earth  but many aspects of these spectacular displays are still poorly understood. Thanks to the joint European Space Agency and NASA's Cluster mission combined with data from a past NASA mission called the Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration  or IMAGE  a particular type of very high-latitude aurora has now been explained.  Known as a theta aurora -- because seen from above it looks like the Greek letter theta  an oval with a line crossing through the center -- this type of aurora sometimes occurs closer to the poles than normal aurora.  While the genesis of the auroral oval emissions is reasonably well understood  the origin of the theta aurora was unclear until now. A paper in the Dec. 19  2014  issue of Science shows that hot plasma funneled into near-Earth space from the sun helps cause these unique aurora.  “The possibilities have been debated since the first satellite observations of the phenomenon were made in the 1980s ” said Robert Fear of the University of Southampton in the U.K. (formerly at the University of Leicester)  and lead author of the Science paper.  Although separated by some 93 million miles  the sun and Earth are connected by what's known as the solar wind. This plasma – electrically charged atomic particles – streams from the sun and travels across the solar system  carrying its own magnetic field along for the ride.  Depending on how this interplanetary magnetic field is aligned in relationship to Earth’s magnetic field  there can be various results when the solar wind arrives at near-Earths space. At the point where the two fields meet  Earth’s magnetic field points north. If the interplanetary field points in the opposite direction -- south -- then something called magnetic reconnection occurs  causing magnetic field lines pointing in opposite directions to suddenly realign into a new configuration.  The realignment opens the door so that solar wind material can funnel into the magnetosphere – the giant magnetic bubble surrounding Earth. This is what leads to the aurora  which is produced when the particles funnel down along Earth’s magnetic field lines and strike atoms high in the atmosphere. The interaction with oxygen atoms results in a green or  more rarely  red glow in the night sky  while nitrogen atoms yield blue and purple colors. Normally  the main region for this impressive display is the auroral oval  which lies at around 65–70 degrees north or south of the equator  encircling the polar caps.  But when the interplanetary magnetic field points northward  auroras can occur at even higher latitudes  sometimes resulting in theta aurora. Prior to the recent work  scientists suspected that theta aurora had something to do with the particles observed in the lobe regions of the magnetosphere. The plasma in the lobes is normally cold  but previous observations suggested that theta auroras are linked with unusually hot lobe plasma – but just how was unclear.  “It was unclear whether this hot plasma was a result of direct solar wind entry through the lobes of the magnetosphere " said Fear. "Or if the plasma is somehow related to the plasma sheet on the night side of Earth. One idea is that the process of magnetic reconnection on the night side of Earth causes a build-up of trapped  hot plasma in the higher latitude lobes."  The mystery was finally solved by studying data collected simultaneously by the Cluster and IMAGE spacecraft on Sept. 15  2005. While the four Cluster satellites were located in the southern hemisphere magnetic lobe  IMAGE had a wide-field view of the southern hemisphere aurora. As one Cluster satellite observed uncharacteristically energetic plasma in the lobe  IMAGE saw the arc of the theta aurora cross the magnetic footprint of Cluster.  The team found that the energetic plasma appeared on high-latitude magnetic field lines that had been closed by the process of magnetic reconnection driven by the northward pointed fields. This in turn caused the plasma to become relatively hot. Such observations support the idea that theta aurora are due to plasma trapped inside the magnetosphere  rather than material being directly pushed in from the solar wind.  "Solving the question of the origin of the theta aurora required Cluster’s high inclination orbit that sweeps over the region where the aurora are generated together with the imaging capability of IMAGE  which is no longer functioning " said Melvyn Goldstein  Cluster project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt  Maryland. "Hopefully  future missions will give comparable capabilities to view the polar regions of the magnetosphere."  Cluster consists of four satellites flying in formation around Earth. The data presented in this report were collected by Cluster-1. The Cluster mission was launched in 2000 and is still operating. IMAGE was launched in 2000 and concluded operations at the end of 2005. The data presented in this report were collected by the satellite’s far-ultraviolet Wideband Imaging Camera.   Credit: ESA - European Space Agency & NASA Goddard,HER,photo

December 29  1980  Space Shuttle Columbia rolls out of the Vehicle Assembly Building at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in preparation for her first mission  STS-1.  The first launch had originally been set for 1979  but a variety of problems (particularly with the thermal protection tiles and the Space Shuttle Main Engines) continued to push the launch date into 1981.    Finally  on this day in 1980  Columbia rolled to Pad 39A.  The Shuttle would sit on that pad for nearly 4 months while insulation problems with the External Tank (painted white for the first two launches) and other glitches were worked out.  Eventually  the launch date was set for the week of April 5  1981.  Computer problems led to a scrub on the first launch attempt (on April 10)  but Columbia made her inaugural launch on the second attempt - April 12  1981.

Man of Steel  ISRO bids a sombre farewell to its iconic leader  Dr. K. Radhakrishnan  who superannuated today. An efficient engineer  magnificent manager  an impeccable institution builder; and an inspiring leader – Dr. Radhakrishnan triumphantly led ISRO through many historic milestones in the last five years being at the helm of affairs.   He was conferred with Padma- Bhushan  the third highest Civilian Award in India  in 2014. A Distinguished Alumnus Awardee of both IIT Kharagpur and IIM Bangalore – he was recognised with several distinctions. Being in the top ten scientific personalities in 2014 by Nature Science Journal  The Allan D Emil Award of International Astronautical Federation are some of glimpses of his international recognition.   After completing his graduation in Electrical Engineering from Kerala University  he joined Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) in 1971 and rose through the ranks  in brisk pace. He was handpicked by Prof. Satish Dhawan – the then Chairman of ISRO  to control and monitor the Budget and Economic Analysis activities at ISRO Head Quarters. By then he had completed his post graduation from the Indian Institute of Management  Bangalore. He bloomed to full glory at ISRO during 1981-2000 – in a period when he occupied several coveted positions like Project Director for establishment of Regional Remote Sensing Centers  Director of Budget and Economic Analyses  Program Director for National Natural Resource Management Systems and Mission Director of Integrated Mission of Sustainable Development and Deputy Director at the National Remote Sensing Agency (NRSA)  Hyderabad. Meanwhile he also completed his PhD from Indian Institute of Technology  Kharagpur.   During 2000-2005 he had a small stint at Ministry of Earth Science – where he established the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) and India’s Tsunami Warning Centre.   He came back to ISRO as Director of NRSA and went on to become the Director of VSSC  his alma-mater at ISRO. After delivering five consecutive successful PSLV missions including the PSLV-C11 that lofted Chandrayaan-1 and leading several crucial technology development at VSSC – he took over the reins of Indian Space Programme in November 2009; and the rest are matters of legend.   With the 12 successful PSLV missions  the successful GSLV with indigenous cryogenic stage  the Mars Orbiter Mission  the LVM-3 experimental flight with CARE module  the Six INSAT/GSAT satellites  three navigation Satellites and Six Earth Observation satellites (including RISAT-1  the first microwave imaging satellite)  Dr. Radhakrishnan is leaving  ISRO at its most glorified pedestal ever.   Team ISRO is determined –to strive harder to match the standard that he set and of course carry the organization to much higher level from here.

Today is Perihelion -  Earth is closest to the Sun.  At 06:36 UT on January 4 Earth was only approx. 91.40 million miles (or 147.09 million km) from the Sun.   Why is that? Well  Earth is not in a circular orbit around the Sun. It actually is an elliptical orbit and around January 4th each year  we are at the spot closest to the Sun. And around July 4th we are at the furthest distance from the Sun. The difference is a good 3 million miles or 5 million km. A big distance in numbers but nothing major at the scale of the Universe.   And just because Earth is closest to the Sun today  you actually barely notice an increase in temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere. It's in the order of 1 or 2 degrees celsius only.   How about the Southern Hemisphere where it is currently summer? Does this closest approach to the Sun increase the temperatures down there there? Also not really since there is more ocean in the Southern Hemisphere and water is a great heat sink; cooling temperatures in the summer.   As we are traveling around the Sun at approx. 20 miles or 30 km per second  everyday increases or decreases our distance to the Sun. Until July 4 we are now moving further away again...

Yesterday's update about the Earth being closest to the Sun all year got lots of questions about "Why is it winter then?".    Earth’s orbit is not a perfect circle. It is a bit lop-sided or elliptical. Right now Earth is closer to the Sun than the rest of the year.   So  in the Northern Hemisphere  we are having winter when Earth is closest to the Sun and summer when it is farthest away! Compared with how far away the Sun is  this change in Earth's distance throughout the year does not make much difference to our weather.  There is a different reason for Earth's seasons.  Earth's axis is an imaginary pole going right through the center of Earth from "top" to "bottom." Earth spins around this pole  making one complete turn each day. That is why we have day and night  and why every part of Earth's surface gets some of each.  Earth has seasons because its axis doesn't stand up straight. Long  long ago  when Earth was young  it is thought that something big hit Earth and knocked it off-kilter. So instead of rotating with its axis straight up and down  it leans over a bit. Actually  the axis of rotation makes an angle of about 23.5 degrees with the direction perpendicular to the ecliptic. That makes life a lot more interesting.   As Earth orbits the Sun  its tilted axis always points in the same direction. So  throughout the year  different parts of Earth get the Sun’s direct rays.  Sometimes it is the North Pole tilting toward the sun (around June) and sometimes it is the South Pole tilting toward the Sun (around December).  It is summer in June in the Northern Hemisphere because the Sun's rays hit that part of Earth more directly than at any other time of the year. It is winter in December in the Northern Hemisphere  because that is when it is the South Pole's turn to be tilted toward the Sun.  Credit: NASA Spaceplace,HER,photo
A "Merry Perihelion" to you all.  Yesterday  Earth  in its oval orbit  came closer to the Sun than at any other time of year.  About 3.5 million miles closer than in July.  Seems like a lot. But Earth's oval orbit deviates only about 3% from a perfect circle.  And since it's currently winter in the Northern Hemisphere  this orbital fact can't possibly be the origin of the Seasons. Those are instead traceable to Earth's axial tilt.  So if you see astronomers dancing in the street this week  this may be why.    -NDTyson,HER,status

Hubble Goes High Def to Revisit the Iconic 'Pillars of Creation'  Although NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope has taken many breathtaking images of the universe  one snapshot stands out from the rest: the iconic view of the so-called “Pillars of Creation.” The jaw-dropping photo  taken in 1995  revealed never-before-seen details of three giant columns of cold gas bathed in the scorching ultraviolet light from a cluster of young  massive stars in a small region of the Eagle Nebula  or M16.  Though such butte-like features are common in star-forming regions  the M16 structures are by far the most photogenic and evocative. The Hubble image is so popular that it has appeared in movies and television shows  on T-shirts and pillows  and even on a postage stamp.  And now  in celebration of its upcoming 25th anniversary in April  Hubble has revisited the famous pillars  providing astronomers with a sharper and wider view. As a bonus  the pillars have been photographed in near-infrared light  as well as visible light. The infrared view transforms the pillars into eerie  wispy silhouettes seen against a background of myriad stars. That’s because the infrared light penetrates much of the gas and dust  except for the densest regions of the pillars. Newborn stars can be seen hidden away inside the pillars. The new images are being unveiled at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Seattle.  Read more: http://1.usa.gov/1vZEEzf,HER,photo
One of my personal favorite features on the Sun are Coronal Loops. This segment in the 171 angstrom wavelength covers approx. 2.5 days from January 3 to about 7:00 AM UT on January 6  2015.   Coronal Loops are found around sunspots and in active regions. These structures are associated with the closed magnetic field lines that connect magnetic regions on the solar surface.  Energetic particles spinning along magnetic field lines make them visible to us.   Many Coronal Loops last for days or weeks but most change quite rapidly.   Some loops  however  are associated with solar flares and are visible for much shorter periods.   The three-dimensional structure and the dynamics of these loops is an area of active research.

Here's the beautiful Pillars of Creation in infrared. Image captured by the Hubble Space Telescope.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2015/01/image/f/  More about the image:   This NASA Hubble Space Telescope image  taken in near-infrared light  transforms the pillars into eerie  wispy silhouettes  which are seen against a background of myriad stars.  The near-infrared light can penetrate much of the gas and dust  revealing stars behind the nebula as well as hidden away inside the pillars. Some of the gas and dust clouds are so dense that even the near-infrared light cannot penetrate them. New stars embedded in the tops of the pillars  however  are apparent as bright sources that are unseen in the visible image.  The ghostly bluish haze around the dense edges of the pillars is material getting heated up by the intense ultraviolet radiation from a cluster of young  massive stars and evaporating away into space. The stellar grouping is above the pillars and cannot be seen in the image. At the top edge of the left-hand pillar  a gaseous fragment has been heated up and is flying away from the structure  underscoring the violent nature of star-forming regions.  Astronomers used filters that isolate the light from newly formed stars  which are invisible in the visible-light image. At these wavelengths  astronomers are seeing through the pillars and even through the back wall of the nebula cavity and can see the next generations of stars just as they're starting to emerge from their formative nursery.

The Expedition 42 crew members are safe and in good shape inside the Russian segment of the International Space Station following an alarm in the U.S. segment at about 4 a.m. EST.   Flight controllers in Mission Control at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston saw an increase in pressure in the station’s water loop for thermal control system B then later saw a cabin pressure increase that could be indicative of an ammonia leak in the worst case scenario. Acting conservatively to protect for the worst case scenario  the crew was directed to isolate themselves in the Russian segment while the teams are evaluating the situation. Non-essential equipment in the U.S. segment of the station was also powered down per the procedures.   In an exchange at 7:02 a.m. with Expedition 42 Commander Barry Wilmore of NASA  spacecraft communicator James Kelly said flight controllers were analyzing their data but said it is not yet known if the alarm was actually triggered by a leak or whether the situation was caused by a faulty sensor or by a problem in a computer relay box that sends data and commands to various systems on the station.  Controllers are assessing the issue  an update will be provided on NASA TV at 11 a.m. EST.,HER,photo
ISRO's Mars Orbiter Mission team has won the prestigious Space Pioneer Award of the National Space Society USA -in the science and engineering category.,HER,photo
Emergency on the Space Station this morning. High pressure ammonia may be leaking into where the crew lives. The crew heard the alarm  put on oxygen masks  hurried into the Russian segment  closed hatches and are safe: calm  together  working the problem.   NASA is looking to see if it was a real ammonia leak  or just sensor problems (1st indication is a cabin pressure rise). That will take time  so the 4 men and 2 women are meanwhile locked in 1/4 the normal space  sharing Russian food and one toilet for at least a day  maybe more.  Ammonia is used for cooling the Space Station through pipes & heat exchangers on the outside of Station. It is an excellent coolant  but is poisonous to breathe. If it breaks through to the inside it is one of the big 3 emergencies. The other two we train for are fire/smoke & leak/depressurization.   A quick solution would be to vent the external ammonia out into space. There are two systems so that would lose half cooling for Station  with an ensuing big effect inside. Would also then need to fix any leak and ship up a new ammonia supply. Hopefully none of that will be needed here.  I lost count of the number of times that we practiced this exact procedure in the simulators in Houston. Serious risk requires serious preparation.,HER,photo

Planets outside our solar system may be more hospitable to life than thought  research suggests.  Astrophysicists suggest that exoplanets are more likely to have liquid water and be more habitable than once thought. If correct  there would be no permanent  cold night side on exoplanets causing water to remain trapped in a gigantic ice sheet. Whether this new understanding of exoplanets' climate increases the ability of these planets to develop life  however  remains an open question. Find out more: http://buff.ly/17RIAhb,HER,photo

The first 100 000 000 on-orbit NASA SDO Images...  On 7 June 2011  a massive explosion rocked the Sun  as a large eruption lifted an enormous amount of cool  dark material into the corona (shown here in a combination of three false-color images in 211A/193A/171A in red/green/blue).   Most of that material eventually fell back onto the Sun  where the gravitational energy of the fall caused it to heat up to a million degrees and more. Scientists studying that falling material concluded that what we say there  was a small-scale version of what happens as stars form and collect gases onto them by their gravity. Thus  AIA allowed us to study in detail what cannot be seen in any detail elsewhere in the universe.   Credit: NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory (Little SDO),HER,photo

Zoom into the Andromeda galaxy  The largest NASA Hubble Space Telescope image ever assembled  this sweeping view of a portion of the Andromeda galaxy (M31) is the sharpest large composite image ever taken of our galactic neighbor. Though the galaxy is over 2 million light-years away  the Hubble telescope is powerful enough to resolve individual stars in a 61 000-light-year-long section of the galaxy's pancake-shaped disk. It's like photographing a beach and resolving individual grains of sand. And  there are lots of stars in this sweeping view — over 100 million  with some of them in thousands of star clusters seen embedded in the disk. This ambitious photographic cartography of the Andromeda galaxy represents a new benchmark for precision studies of large spiral galaxies which dominate the universe's population of over 100 billion galaxies. Never before have astronomers been able to see individual stars over a major portion of an external spiral galaxy. Most of the stars in the universe live inside such majestic star cities  and this is the first data that reveal populations of stars in context to their home galaxy.  Credit: NASA  ESA  and G.

The first 100 000 000 on-orbit NASA SDO Images...   AIA enables us to observe the corona at high resolution and at multiple "colors"  which represent temperatures of the glowing gas in the corona: in the image on the top  blue is about 1 million degrees  green about 1.5 million  an red is 2 million degrees or even more (which means all temperatures occur along a line of sight  with different temperatures at different depths in the corona). But AIA is also very precise  and thus very sensitive to small changes: in the image on the bottom  we removed everything that was not changing from one exposure to the next  showing only where the ongoing solar flare and coronal mass ejection (explosion) deformed the coronal gas anf magnetic field. In the case of this eruption (on 7 March 2012  around 01:06 UT) we see that the eruption affects over half the Sun (with a diameter of almost a million miles)  and reaches into the corona up the the very edges of AIA's field of view. These deformations  including many wave phenomena  tell us more about the Sun's ever-changing corona. credit: NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory (Little SDO),HER,photo

Happy Hubble Friday!  This Picture of the Week shows Arp 230  also known as IC 51  observed by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope. Arp 230 is a galaxy of an uncommon or peculiar shape  and is therefore part of the Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies produced by Halton Arp. Its irregular shape is thought to be the result of a violent collision with another galaxy sometime in the past. The collision could also be held responsible for the formation of the galaxy’s polar ring.  The outer ring surrounding the galaxy consists of gas and stars and rotates over the poles of the galaxy. It is thought that the orbit of the smaller of the two galaxies that created Arp 230 was perpendicular to the disk of the second  larger galaxy when they collided. In the process of merging the smaller galaxy would have been ripped apart and may have formed the polar ring structure astronomers can observe today.  Arp 230 is quite small for a lenticular galaxy  so the two original galaxies forming it must both have been smaller than the Milky Way.  A lenticular galaxy is a galaxy with a prominent central bulge and a disk  but no clear spiral arms.  They are classified as intermediate between an elliptical galaxy and a spiral galaxy.

On the Edge of Mercury  In this image  Mercury's horizon cuts a striking edge against the stark blackness of space. On the right  sunlight harshly brings the landscape into relief while on the left  the surface is shrouded in the darkness of night.  This image was acquired as part of MDIS's limb imaging campaign. Once per week  MDIS captures images of Mercury's limb  with an emphasis on imaging the southern hemisphere limb. These limb images provide information about Mercury's shape and complement measurements of topography made by the Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA) of Mercury's northern hemisphere.  The MESSENGER spacecraft is the first ever to orbit the planet Mercury  and the spacecraft's seven scientific instruments and radio science investigation are unraveling the history and evolution of the Solar System's innermost planet. In the mission's more than three years of orbital operations  MESSENGER has acquired over 250 000 images and extensive other data sets. MESSENGER is capable of continuing orbital operations until early 2015.  Credit: NASA/Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory/Carnegie Institution of Washington,HER,photo
The far side of the moon  like the side we can see from Earth  goes through a complete cycle of phases. But unlike the side we can see  the terrain of the far side is quite different. Learn more: http://go.nasa.gov/1KcDj1C & www.nasa.gov/lro  The far side of the moon lacks the large dark spots  called maria  that make up the familiar Man in the Moon on the near side. Instead  craters of all sizes crowd together over the entire far side. The far side is also home to one of the largest and oldest impact features in the solar system  the South Pole-Aitken basin  visible here as a slightly darker bruise covering the bottom third of the disk.  The far side was first seen in a handful of grainy images returned by the Soviet Luna 3 probe  which swung around the Moon in October  1959. The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter  or LRO  was launched fifty years later  and since then it has returned hundreds of terabytes of data  allowing LRO scientists to create extremely detailed and accurate maps of the far side. Those maps were used to create the imagery seen here.  More on Facebook here: httpsa//httpsa//www.facebook.com/LunarReconnaissanceOrbiteraaahttpsa//www.facebook.com/,HER,video

Hubble captures a rare look at three of Jupiter’s largest moons parading across the giant gas planet’s banded face. http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1504/,HER,photo
Latest News: Firing off a string of snapshots like a sports photographer at a NASCAR race  NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured a rare look at three of Jupiter's largest moons zipping across the banded face of the gas-giant planet: Europa  Callisto  and Io. Jupiter's four largest moons can commonly be seen transiting the face of the giant planet and casting shadows onto its cloud tops. However  seeing three moons transiting the face of Jupiter at the same time is rare  occurring only once or twice a decade. Missing from the sequence  taken on January 24  2015  is the moon Ganymede that was too far from Jupiter in angular separation to be part of the conjunction.  Join Hubble Heritage Team members during the live Hubble Hangout event at 3:00 pm (EST) today (Thursday  February 5) to learn more about Jupiter's rare triple-moon conjunction.

What's large and blue and can wrap itself around an entire galaxy? A gravitational lens mirage. Pictured above  the gravity of a luminous red galaxy (LRG) has gravitationally distorted the light from a much more distant blue galaxy. More typically  such light bending results in two discernible images of the distant galaxy  but here the lens alignment is so precise that the background galaxy is distorted into a horseshoe -- a nearly complete ring. Since such a lensing effect was generally predicted in some detail by Albert Einstein over 70 years ago  rings like this are now known as Einstein Rings.   Although LRG 3-757 was discovered in 2007 in data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)  the image shown above is a follow-up observation taken with the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field Camera 3. Strong gravitational lenses like LRG 3-757 are more than oddities -- their multiple properties allow astronomers to determine the mass and dark matter content of the foreground galaxy lenses: http://buff.ly/16BixtM,HER,photo

NASA's SDO Sees Giant Filament on the Sun  A dark line snaked across the lower half of the sun on Feb.10  2015  as seen in this image from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory  or SDO. SDO shows colder material as dark and hotter material as light  so the line is  in fact  an enormous swatch of colder material hovering in the sun's atmosphere  the corona. Stretched out  that line – or solar filament as scientists call it – would be more than 533 000 miles long. That is longer than 67 Earths lined up in a row.  Filaments can float sedately for days before disappearing. Sometimes they also erupt out into space  releasing solar material in a shower that either rains back down or escapes out into space  becoming a moving cloud known as a coronal mass ejection  or CME.  SDO captured images of the filament in numerous wavelengths  each of which helps highlight material of different temperatures on the sun. By looking at such features in different wavelengths and temperatures  scientists learn more about what causes these structures  as well as what catalyzes their occasional eruptions.

In 2015  NASA will be recognizing 50 years of spacewalking  or Extravehicular Activity (EVA).  Throughout the year  we will be celebrating accomplishments like these with a look towards the future. Specifically  how spacewalking enhances our exploration capabilities and enables humans to go deeper into the solar system in part by suiting up!  Two important dates to remember are March 18  the anniversary of the first spacewalk by Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov who left his Voskhod-2 vehicle for a 12-minute tethered walk  and June 3  when NASA’s Ed White exited his Gemini-4 capsule using a hand-held oxygen jet gun to push himself from the hatch for a 23-minute tethered spacewalk.

Fireball over Pennsylvania!  This morning (2015 February 17)  a space rock about 2 feet in diameter and weighing roughly 500 pounds entered Earth’s atmosphere above western Pennsylvania. First detected by 3 NASA meteor cameras at an altitude of 60 miles above Beaver Falls  the fireball moved almost due east at a speed of 45 000 miles per hour. It flared brighter than the Full Moon before the cameras lost track of it at an altitude of 13 miles above the town of Kittanning; there may be fragments (meteorites) scattered on the ground east of that location.

Hubble Images a Dusty Galaxy  Home to an Exploding Star  The galaxy pictured here is NGC 4424  located in the constellation of Virgo. It is not visible with the naked eye but has been captured here with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope.  Although it may not be obvious from this image  NGC 4424 is in fact a spiral galaxy. In this image it is seen more or less edge on  but from above  you would be able to see the arms of the galaxy wrapping around its center to give the characteristic spiral form.  In 2012  astronomers observed a supernova in NGC 4424 — a violent explosion marking the end of a star’s life. During a supernova explosion  a single star can often outshine an entire galaxy. However  the supernova in NGC 4424  dubbed SN 2012cg  cannot be seen here as the image was taken ten years prior to the explosion. Along the central region of the galaxy  clouds of dust block the light from distant stars and create dark patches.  To the left of NGC 4424 there are two bright objects in the frame. The brightest is another  smaller galaxy known as LEDA 213994 and the object closer to NGC 4424 is an anonymous star in our Milky Way.

Magnetic reconnection is like "crossing the streams" in outer space. But in this case  instead of destroying the Sumerian god Gozer  crossing the streams causes explosive realignment of our magnetic field  sending near-light-speed showers of charged particles towards the Earth.  This process causes our beautiful auroras as well  as potentially disrupting communications and power grids here on Earth. The MMS (Magnetospheric Multiscale) mission was designed to study this phenomenon where it happens in near-Earth space. MMS is planned to launch Thursday  Learn more: http://go.nasa.gov/1F7Fzq4 #MagRecon,HER,video

Brief Outburst  The Sun blew out a coronal mass ejection along with part of a solar filament over a three-hour period (Feb. 24  2015). While some of the strands fell back into the Sun  a substantial part raced into space in a bright cloud of particles (as observed by the SOHO spacecraft). The activity was captured in a wavelength of extreme ultraviolet light. Because this occurred way over near the edge of the Sun  it was unlikely to have any effect on Earth.

NASA’s Hubble Observations Suggest Underground Ocean on Jupiter’s Largest Moon  NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope has the best evidence yet for an underground saltwater ocean on Ganymede  Jupiter’s largest moon. The subterranean ocean is thought to have more water than all the water on Earth’s surface.  Identifying liquid water is crucial in the search for habitable worlds beyond Earth and for the search of life as we know it.  “This discovery marks a significant milestone  highlighting what only Hubble can accomplish ” said John Grunsfeld  assistant administrator of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters  Washington. “In its 25 years in orbit  Hubble has made many scientific discoveries in our own solar system. A deep ocean under the icy crust of Ganymede opens up further exciting possibilities for life beyond Earth.”  Ganymede is the largest moon in our solar system and the only moon with its own magnetic field. The magnetic field causes aurorae  which are ribbons of glowing  hot electrified gas  in regions circling the north and south poles of the moon. Because Ganymede is close to Jupiter  it is also embedded in Jupiter’s magnetic field. When Jupiter’s magnetic field changes  the aurorae on Ganymede also change  “rocking” back and forth.  By watching the rocking motion of the two aurorae  scientists were able to determine that a large amount of saltwater exists beneath Ganymede’s crust affecting its magnetic field.

Total solar eclipse in the wee hours of the night!  In a rare space event  the moon will be directly between the Earth and the Sun tomorrow morning  creating a solar eclipse.  Although a partial eclipse will be visible in some countries  including Europe  only the people in remote regions in the northern hemisphere will get to experience the full effect. For those in the Arctic  the sun will be completely obscured for 2 minutes 46.9 seconds.   In Canada  the solar eclipse will take place between 3:41 a.m. and 7:50 a.m. ET  making it impossible for most Canadians to see the moon completely covering the disk of the sun. However  if you live in Newfoundland  southeastern Baffin Island  northeastern Ellesmere Island or the eastern parts of Labrador (including Goose Bay and most coastal communities)  you can still try your luck at sunrise to see a glimpse of the partial eclipse.  Just a reminder to everyone in the eclipse zone:  be very careful and never look directly at the sun without proper equipment as it could cause permanent damage to your eyes! Safety first!   If you’re not in the eclipse zone  you can watch it via webcast thanks to Slooh: http://main.slooh.com/,HER,photo

Shortest total lunar eclipse of the century to occur tomorrow morning   Early birds will have the chance to admire a total lunar eclipse Saturday morning for nearly five minutes – the shortest total eclipse in the century – as the Earth will come in between the sun and the moon  casting a shadow on the moon.    This eclipse will offer a beautiful spectacle as the moon will turn to a beautiful shade of red – hence its nickname “Blood Moon”.  This phenomenon is caused as the Earth's atmosphere refracts sunlight and indirectly lights up the Moon's surface.   The eclipse will start at 6:16 a.m. ET on Saturday  just as the moon sets on Eastern Canada. Western Canada  especially those of you in British Columbia  will be lucky enough to see the eclipse starting at 3:16 a.m. and peaking just before 5 a.m. PT – if you are willing to get out of bed this early!

Studies of the Sun  Atmosphere  and Auroras  During the last few weeks  astronauts on the International Space Station shared a series of spectacular photographs showing the sun rising from or dropping into the thin blue line of our atmosphere. By focusing on the boundaries between day and night and Earth and space  the photographs offer rich new perspective on our familiar notions of "sunset" and "sunrise." With the Sun just below the horizon  the astronauts also captured stunning views of the blue glow of the atmosphere mingling with that of shimmering green aurora. "The Sun truly 'comes up like thunder ' and it sets just as fast " is how Joseph Allen  a NASA astronaut who participated in Shuttle missions in the 1980s  described sunrises and sunsets. "Each sunrise and sunset lasts only a few seconds. But in that time you see at least eight different bands of color come and go  from a brilliant red to the brightest and deepest blue. And you see sixteen sunrises and sixteen sunsets every day you're in space. No sunrise or sunset is ever the same " he said.

As bright as a hundred million Suns: the clusters of monster stars that lit up the early universe.  The first stars in the Universe were born several hundred million years after the Big Bang  ending a period known as the cosmological 'dark ages' -- when atoms of hydrogen and helium had formed  but nothing shone in visible light. Now researchers have calculated what these objects were like: they find that the first stars could have clustered together in phenomenally bright groups  with periods when they were as luminous as 100 million Suns: http://buff.ly/1EsTrNq,HER,photo

Happy 25th anniversary to the Hubble Space Telescope!   The brilliant tapestry of young stars flaring to life resemble a glittering fireworks display in this anniversary NASA Hubble Space Telescope image to commemorate a quarter century of exploring the solar system and beyond since the telescope's launch on April 24  1990.  The sparkling centerpiece of Hubble's silver anniversary fireworks is a giant cluster of about 3 000 stars called Westerlund 2  named for Swedish astronomer Bengt Westerlund  who discovered the grouping in the 1960s. The cluster resides in a raucous stellar breeding ground known as Gum 29  located 20 000 light-years away from Earth in the constellation Carina.  To capture this image  Hubble’s Wide Field Camera 3 pierced through the dusty veil shrouding the stellar nursery in near-infrared light  giving astronomers a clear view of the nebula and the dense concentration of stars in the central cluster. The cluster measures between 6 to 13 light-years across.  The giant star cluster is only about 2 million years old and contains some of our galaxy's hottest  brightest  and most massive stars. Some of its heftiest stars unleash torrents of ultraviolet light and hurricane-force winds of charged particles that etch at the enveloping hydrogen gas cloud.  The nebula reveals a fantasy landscape of pillars  ridges  and valleys. The pillars  composed of dense gas and thought to be incubators for new stars  are a few light-years tall and point to the central star cluster. Other dense regions surround the pillars  including reddish-brown filaments of gas and dust.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2015/12/,HER,photo

Astronomers Set a New Galaxy Distance Record  An international team of astronomers  led by Yale University and University of California scientists  has pushed back the cosmic frontier of galaxy exploration to a time when the universe was only 5 percent of its present age of 13.8 billion years. The team discovered an exceptionally luminous galaxy more than 13 billion years in the past and determined its exact distance from Earth using the combined data from NASA's Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes  and the Keck I 10-meter telescope at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. These observations confirmed it to be the most distant galaxy currently measured  setting a new record.

The annual eta Aquariid meteor shower will be best observed just before dawn tomorrow morning. Peak rates are normally around 40 meteors per hour  but the gibbous Moon will wash out the fainter etas  resulting in about 15-20 per hour under clear skies. This debris from Comet Halley hits Earth's atmosphere at a whopping 147 000 miles per hour (66 kilometers per second) and starts ablating (burning up) at altitudes around 68 miles (110 kilometers); most are vaporized by the time they reach 56 miles (90 kilometers) above the Earth's surface. The radiant rises late  so don't expect to see many etas before 3 AM local time.  Our all sky cameras have detected 22 eta Aquariid fireballs since April 29.

Latest News: The heart of the giant globular star cluster 47 Tucanae reveals the glow of 200 000 stars. In this cluster  Hubble spied a parade of young white dwarfs starting their 40-million-year migration away from the core. In globular clusters  lower mass stars rob momentum from more massive stars. Heavier stars sink to the cluster’s core as their orbits slow  while lighter stars pick up speed and move across the cluster to the edge.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2015/16/  Find wallpaper of today's image here: http://hubblesite.org/gallery/wallpaper/pr2015016b/  Find it in our Printshop: http://hubblesite.org/gallery/printshop/ps59/,HER,photo

Hubble Observes One-of-a-Kind Star Nicknamed ‘Nasty’  Astronomers using NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope have uncovered surprising new clues about a hefty  rapidly aging star whose behavior has never been seen before in our Milky Way galaxy. In fact  the star is so weird that astronomers have nicknamed it “Nasty 1 ” a play on its catalog name of NaSt1. The star may represent a brief transitory stage in the evolution of extremely massive stars.

Cassini seeks out Saturn's shimmering aurorae   When charged particles from the Sun reach a planet's atmosphere  they can transfer their energy to electrons around atoms and molecules in the atmosphere. These electrons get excited and become unstable. The energy is then released as light  which  on Earth  we see as red and green lights in the sky. Those colors indicate the presence of nitrogen and oxygen. On Saturn  the aurorae have a red-purple hue due to the hydrogen in the atmosphere. Cassini's detectors detected these aurorae!

Space Shuttle Discovery's STS-96 mission  a logistics and supply mission to the International Space Station (ISS) launched on this day (May 27) in 1999  making Discovery the first Shuttle to dock with the orbital laboratory. (At that point ISS consisted of the Unity and Zarya modules  which had been joined in orbit in December 1998.) During the course of the 10-day STS-96 mission  the crew transferred 3 567 pounds of material – including clothing  sleeping bags  spare parts  medical equipment  supplies  hardware and about 84 gallons of water – to the interior of the station. This first outing to the ISS was an international venture that included American and Canadian astronauts and a Russian cosmonaut. It was a crucial step in preparing the ISS for the first expedition crew  launched in late 2000.

Sun Says "Keep Right"  Is the sun trying to send a message?  A pair of giant filaments on the face of the sun have formed what appears to be an enormous arrow pointing to the right. If straightened out  each filament would be about as long as the sun’s diameter  1 million miles long.    Filaments are cooler clouds of solar material suspended above the sun's surface by powerful magnetic forces.  Filaments can float for days without much change  though they can also erupt  releasing solar material in a shower that either rains back down or escapes out into space  becoming a moving cloud known as a coronal mass ejection  or CME.  This image was taken in combined wavelengths of extreme ultraviolet light by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory  which observes the sun 24 hours a day.   Credit: NASA/SDO,HER,photo

Hubble Finds Two Chaotically Tumbling Pluto Moons  This computer animation illustrates how Pluto's moon Nix changes its spin unpredictably as it orbits the "double planet" Pluto-Charon. The view is from the surface of Pluto as the moon circles the Pluto-Charon system. This is a time-lapse view of the moon  compressing four years of motion into two minutes  with one complete orbit of Pluto-Charon every two seconds. (The apparent star movement rate is greatly slowed down for illustration purposes.) The animation is based on dynamical models of spinning bodies in complex gravitational fields — like the field produced by Pluto and Charon's motion about each other. Astronomers used this simulation to try to understand the unpredictable changes in reflected light from Nix as it orbits Pluto-Charon. They also found that Pluto's moon Hydra also undergoes chaotic spin. The football shape of both moons contributes to their wild motion. The consequences are that if you lived on either moon  you could not predict the time or direction the sun would rise the next morning. (The moon is too small for Hubble to resolve surface features  and so the surface textures used here are purely for illustration purposes.)  Credit: NASA  ESA  M. Showalter (SETI Institute)  and G.

Galaxy lost in space — new Hubble image of NGC 6503 http://spacetelescope.org/news/heic1513/,HER,photo
Latest News: Most galaxies are clumped together in groups or clusters. A neighboring galaxy is never far away. But this galaxy  known as NGC 6503  has found itself in a lonely position  at the edge of a strangely empty patch of space called the Local Void.  The Local Void is a huge stretch of space that is at least 150 million light-years across. It seems completely empty of stars or galaxies. NGC 6503 is 18 million light-years away from us in the northern circumpolar constellation of Draco. NGC 6503 spans some 30 000 light-years  about a third of the size of the Milky Way.  This Hubble Space Telescope image shows NGC 6503 in striking detail and with a rich set of colors. Bright red patches of gas can be seen scattered through its swirling spiral arms  mixed with bright blue regions that contain newly forming stars. Dark brown dust lanes snake across the galaxy's bright arms and center  giving it a mottled appearance.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2015/23/,HER,photo

The "Oort Star" -- Did a Rogue Star Pass Through Our Solar System?    A group of astronomers from the US  Europe  Chile and South Africa have determined that 70 000 years ago a dim star is likely to have passed through the solar system's distant cloud of comets  the Oort Cloud. No other star is known to have ever approached our solar system this close - five times closer than the current closest star  Proxima Centauri.  While the close flyby of Scholz's star likely had little impact on the Oort Cloud  "other dynamically important Oort Cloud perturbers may be lurking among nearby stars."   Currently  Scholz's star is a small  dim red dwarf in the constellation of Monoceros  about 20 light years away. However  at the closest point in its flyby of the solar system  Scholz's star would have been a 10th magnitude star - about 50 times fainter than can normally be seen with the naked eye at night.

Venus and Jupiter Are Offering a Sky Show!  Throughout the month of June  we can admire a great astronomical spectacle  as the planets Venus and Jupiter are getting a little bit closer to one another each day.  The gap between the two planets continues to decrease  so much so that during the evening of June 20 (tomorrow)  the crescent Moon will also join in to form a beautiful triangle in the sky.  Venus and Jupiter will continue to converge until June 30  when they will only be 1/3rd of a degree apart. Although the phenomenon can be observed with the naked eye  a telescope or a pair of binoculars will help enjoy the full spectacle!   Don’t forget to add those dates to your calendar!

What is the June Solstice? There are two solstices in a year  the June solstice (usually June 21) and the December solstice (usually December 21). On the June solstice the sun reaches its highest point in the sky for an observer at the North Pole. On the December solstice the sun reaches its highest point in the sky for an observer at the South Pole. Solstices also mark the change from fall to winter or spring to summer. The solstices happen because of the tilt of Earth’s axis of rotation with respect to its orbital path around the sun. The axis of rotation is an imaginary line drawn straight through Earth connecting the North Pole to the South Pole. This line is tilted 23.5° from Earth’s orbital path around the Sun. This means that the sun’s light does not hit the Earth evenly at a particular latitude above and below the equator. This tilt is the cause of Earth’s seasons. (The equator is an imaginary line drawn right around Earth’s middle  like a belt. It divides Earth into the Northern and the Southern Hemispheres. The imaginary lines around Earth that are parallel to the Equator are called lines of latitude. They are numbered from 0° to 90°. The one at 0° is the equator itself. The higher the number  the farther north (if it’s a + number) or south (if it’s a − number). ) Because of Earth’s tilt is 23.5° the latitudes of +23.5° and −23.5° are special and have special names. The one in the Northern Hemisphere  +23.5° latitude  is called the Tropic of Cancer. The one in the Southern Hemisphere  − 23.5° latitude  is called the Tropic of Capricorn. These are the latitudes where the Sun is directly overhead at noon once a year. In the Northern hemisphere  on the Tropic of Cancer  that is the June Solstice. In the Southern Hemisphere  on the Tropic of Capricorn  that is the December Solstice. These solstice days are the days with the most (for Summer) or fewest (for Winter) hours of sunlight during the whole year. http://www.thesuntoday.org/solar-fa…/the-june-2015-solstice/,HER,link

Dear Facebook Universe   Today marks the 26th time a Leap Second will be added to the calendar.  In the second half of the 20th century  we started tracking time via atomic clocks  which happen to be more accurate and precise than the rotating Earth itself — our technology was better at keeping time than our planet was.  This crossover allowed us to notice that Earth’s rotation rate is  in fact  slowing down.  The primary culprit here is the Moon  whose tidal forces on Earth create friction between the sloshing oceans and our north-south coastlines.  In response  the Moon’s orbit is spiraling away from Earth at a rate of about 2-inches (4cm) per year.  Such is the layout of this cosmic ballet — choreographed by the forces of gravity.  Several other factors also influence Earth’s rotation  but can serve to either slow us down or speed us up. In all cases it involves the re-distribution of mass on Earth’s surface  changing our planets rotation properties.  These includes the freezing and melting of glaciers  mass migrations of animals  the buildup of new dams  and earthquakes.   Three ways to accommodate this fact: 1) Ignore it altogether.  2) Redefine the length of the Second  as necessary  to keep the total number of seconds the same  no matter the length of the day.  Or 3) intermittently add “leap” seconds to compensate.  If we did (1) then eventually  clock time will not make sense relative to what the Sun is doing.  If we did (2) then all the measurements that now depend on the precise definition of the second would be cast into flux.  So we choose option (3).  Beginning in 1972  on June 30 or December 31 (or both) we’ve added 25 leap seconds  as necessary.  Today is such a day.  Beginning in 1972  on June 30 or December 31 or both  we’ve added 25 leap seconds  as necessary.  Today is such a day.  Leap Seconds appear in the final minute of the last hour of today  Greenwich Time.  For the Eastern Time Zone (North America) this corresponds to 7:59 PM.  That minute will have 61 seconds in it.  Something I’ve celebrated each time with a very tiny bottle of champagne.  Whatever you do  don’t waste it.  As always  Keep looking up.  -Neil deGrasse Tyson  New York City  NOTE: June 30  2015. 5:30pm ET:  Added a paragraph (for completeness) and corrected the rate of Moon's recession  from 5 inches to 2 inches per year.,HER,status

Astronomers see pebbles poised to make planets   A team of astronomers announced the discovery of a ring of rocks circling a very young star. This is the first time these 'pebbles'  thought to be a crucial link in building planets  have been detected.   They used an interferometer to observe the star DG Tauri  a relatively youthful star just 2.5 million years old and 450 light years away. Looking at radio wavelengths  they discovered a faint glow characteristic of rocks in orbit around the newly formed star.  Image Credit: J. Ilee  Read more: http://buff.ly/1dHNdN7,HER,photo

Dark strands of plasma hovering above the sun's surface began to interact with each other in a form of tug of war over two and a half days on June 28-30  2015. At times  strands of plasma extended a tenuous connection between one area and the other. Twice the small tower of plasma to the lower left shot a burst of energy over to the quivering filament higher up. We are seeing the push and pull of magnetic forces revealed in a 193 wavelength of extreme ultraviolet light  typically colorized in brown.    http://go.nasa.gov/1Cprnd0 Credit: NASA/SDO,HER,video

Is Kapteyn B Not to Be?   An M-class red dwarf  Kapteyn’s Star is relatively nearby at only 13 light years distant. The discovery was hailed as an example of an ancient—possibly over 11 billion years old—system with its innermost world cast as a ‘super-Earth’ in the habitable zone.   Recent research led by Paul Robertson of Pennsylvania State University suggests that the signal for the discovery of Kapteyn B may in fact be the result of stellar activity. Starspots—think sunspots on our own host star—can mimic the spectral signal of an unseen planet.

A swath of cliffs and troughs stretches about 600 miles (1 000 kilometers) from left to right  suggesting widespread fracturing of Charon’s crust  likely a result of internal processes.

Happy Hubble Friday!  Hubble Uncovering the Secrets of the Quintuplet Cluster  Although this cluster of stars gained its name due to its five brightest stars  it is home to hundreds more. The huge number of massive young stars in the cluster is clearly captured in this NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image.  The cluster is located close to the Arches Cluster and is just 100 light-years from the center of our galaxy. The cluster’s proximity to the dust at the center of the galaxy means that much of its visible light is blocked  which helped to keep the cluster unknown until its discovery in 1990  when it was revealed by infrared observations. Infrared images of the cluster  like the one shown here  allow us to see through the obscuring dust to the hot stars in the cluster.  The Quintuplet Cluster hosts two extremely rare luminous blue variable stars: the Pistol Star and the lesser known V4650 Sgr. If you were to draw a line horizontally through the center of this image from left to right  you could see the Pistol Star hovering just above the line about one third of the way along it. The Pistol Star is one of the most luminous known stars in the Milky Way and takes its name from the shape of the Pistol Nebula that it illuminates  but which is not visible in this infrared image. The exact age and future of the Pistol Star are uncertain  but it is expected to end in a supernova or even a hypernova in one to three million years.  The cluster also contains a number of red supergiants. These stars are among the largest in the galaxy and are burning their fuel at an incredible speed  meaning they will have a very short lifetime. Their presence suggests an average cluster age of nearly four million years. At the moment these stars are on the verge of exploding as supernovae. During their spectacular deaths they will release vast amounts of energy which  in turn  will heat the material — dust and gas — between the other stars.  This observation shows the Quintuplet Cluster in the infrared and demonstrates the leap in Hubble’s performance since its 1999 image of same object.  Credit: ESA/NASA,HER,photo

NASA Captures 'EPIC' New Earth Image from One Million Miles Away  A NASA camera on the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) satellite has returned its first view of the entire sunlit side of Earth from one million miles away.  This color image of Earth was taken by NASA’s Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC)  a four megapixel CCD camera and telescope. The image was generated by combining three separate images to create a photographic-quality image. The camera takes a series of 10 images using different narrowband filters -- from ultraviolet to near infrared -- to produce a variety of science products. The red  green and blue channel images are used in these color images.  The image was taken July 6  2015  showing North and Central America. The central turquoise areas are shallow seas around the Caribbean islands. This Earth image shows the effects of sunlight scattered by air molecules  giving the image a characteristic bluish tint. The EPIC team is working to remove this atmospheric effect from subsequent images. Once the instrument begins regular data acquisition  EPIC will provide a daily series of Earth images allowing for the first time study of daily variations over the entire globe. These images  available 12 to 36 hours after they are acquired  will be posted to a dedicated web page by September 2015.  The primary objective of DSCOVR  a partnership between NASA  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U.S. Air Force  is to maintain the nation’s real-time solar wind monitoring capabilities  which are critical to the accuracy and lead time of space weather alerts and forecasts from NOAA.

Dear Facebook Universe   At the request of the White House  I offer reflections on the attached image of our home  released today  July 20  2015  forty-six years to the day after the first bootprints were left on the Moon.  =========  Earth. Not mounted on a stand  with color-coded state and national boundaries  as schoolroom globes are prone to display. Instead  we see our world as only a cosmic perspective can provide: Blue Oceans -- Dry Land -- White Clouds -- Polar Ice. A Sun-lit planet  teeming with life  framed in darkness.  In 1972  when NASA’s Apollo 17 astronauts first captured an entire hemisphere of our planet  we were treated to such a view. The Blue Marble  it was called. The Space Program’s unprecedented images of Earth compelled us all to think deeply about our dependence on nature and the fate of our civilization.  Of course  at the time  we had other distractions. Between 1968 and 1972  the United States would experience some of its most turbulent years in memory  simultaneously enduring a hot war in Southeast Asia  a Cold War with the Soviet Union  the Civil Rights Movement  campus unrest  and assassinations. Yet that’s precisely when we voyaged to the Moon  paused  looked back  and discovered Earth for the first time.  The year 1970 would celebrate the first Earth Day. In that same year  the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) were formed with strong bipartisan support. In 1972  the pesticide DDT was banned and the Clean Water Act was passed. And one year later  the Endangered Species Act would be enacted  the catalytic converter would be introduced  and unleaded automotive emission standards would be set. A stunning admission that we’re all in this together  with a common future on a shared planet.  Regrettably  we still live in a turbulent world. But we now have at our disposal  not simply a photograph of our home to reflect upon  but continual data of our rotating planet  captured 13 times per day  by the robotic Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR)  a specially designed space camera & telescope  launched and positioned a million miles from Earth.  We will now be able to measure and track Sun-induced space weather as well as global climactic trends in ozone levels  aerosols  vegetation  volcanic ash  and Earth reflectivity  all in high resolution; just the kind of data our civilization needs to make informed cultural  political  and scientific decisions that affect our future.  Occasions such as this offer renewed confidence that we may ultimately become responsible shepherds of our own fate  and the fate of that fragile home we call Earth.

Welcome the discovery of the first small habitable zone planet around a G2 star like our sun: Kepler-452b! Press Release: http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-kepler-mission-discovers-bigger-older-cousin-to-earth,HER,photo
Soaking up the Rays of a Sun-like Star - Artist's Concept of Kepler-452b  This artist's concept depicts one possible appearance of the planet Kepler-452b  the first near-Earth-size world to be found in the habitable zone of star that is similar to our sun. The habitable zone is a region around a star where temperatures are right for water -- an essential ingredient for life as we know it -- to pool on the surface. Scientists do not know if Kepler-452b can support life or not.  What is known about the planet is that it is about 60 percent larger than Earth  placing it in a class of planets dubbed "super-Earths." While its mass and composition are not yet determined  previous research suggests that planets the size of Kepler-452b have a better than even chance of being rocky. Kepler-452b orbits its star every 385 days.  The planet's star is about 1 400 light-years away in the constellation Cygnus. It is a G2-type star like our sun  with nearly the same temperature and mass. This star is 6 billion years old  1.5 billion years older than our sun. As stars age  they grow in size and give out more energy  warming up their planets over time.  Scientists and artists considered these facts when creating this illustration. If the planet Kepler-452b does in fact have liquid on its surface and has grown warmer due to the older age of its star  it could possibly be experiencing a runaway greenhouse effect  where oceans would begin to evaporate and contribute to increased cloud cover. This  plus other factors such as the planet's large size  was factored into the hypothetical scenario depicted in this illustration.  Image credit: NASA Ames/JPL-Caltech/T.

Earth’s bigger  older cousin! With the help of our Kepler Mission  we’ve confirmed the first near-Earth-size planet in the “habitable zone” around a sun-like star. This planet is 60% larger than Earth. The newly discovered Kepler-452b is the smallest planet to date discovered orbiting in the habitable zone -- the area around a star where liquid water could pool on the surface of an orbiting planet -- of a G2-type star  like our sun. The confirmation of Kepler-452b brings the total number of confirmed planets to 1 030. Learn more: http://go.nasa.gov/1fp6ILB #NASABeyond,HER,photo
Close cousins?  Comparison between Earth and Kepler-452b and their host stars  Scientists using data from NASA's Kepler mission have confirmed the first near-Earth-size planet orbiting in the habitable zone of a sun-like star. The habitable zone is the region around a star where temperatures are just right for water to exist in its liquid form.  The artistic concept compares Earth (left) to the new planet  called Kepler-452b  which is about 60 percent larger. The illustration represents one possible appearance for Kepler-452b -- scientists do not know whether the planet has oceans and continents like Earth.  Both planets orbit a G2-type star of about the same temperature; however  the star hosting Kepler-452b is 6 billion years old  1.5 billion years older than our sun. As stars age  they become larger  hotter and brighter  as represented in the illustration. Kepler-452b's star appears a bit larger and brighter.  Image credit: NASA Ames/JPL-Caltech/T. Pyle & W.

Kepler-452b An Exoplanet Similar to Earth Discovered!  NASA announced earlier that astronomers discovered  with the help of the Kepler space telescope  an exoplanet which could very closely resemble Earth. Named Kepler-452b  the planet is located 1 400 light-years away from Earth and orbits around a distant star  at the same distance from its star as our planet from the Sun.  Kepler-452b goes around its star in 385 days and some clues suggest that liquid water – potential source of life – could be found. This star is also very similar to the Sun  as it is only 4% more massive and 10% brighter than our own.  For more information on Kepler-452b and this impressive discovery:  http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-kepler-mission-discovers-bigger-older-cousin-to-earth,HER,photo
It's the closest match yet. #NASABeyond  While Kepler-452b is larger than Earth  its 385-day orbit is only 5 percent longer. The planet is 5 percent farther from its parent star Kepler-452 than Earth is from the Sun. Kepler-452 is 6 billion years old  1.5 billion years older than our sun  has the same temperature  and is 20 percent brighter and has a diameter 10 percent larger.,HER,link

Meteorite Explosion - Santa Cruz  CA 7-21-15  "While shooting some timelapses  we saw a huge bright flash in the sky. It even lit up the entire ground. We looked up and saw a huge streak across the sky of burning dust. I did the calculations and the dust fell from the sky for at least 50 frames of my timelapse. Each exposure was 15 seconds long  so that means the burning dust fell for 12.5 minutes."  Watch video: http://buff.ly/1IhXIlF,HER,video
A NASA camera aboard the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) satellite captured a unique view of the moon as it moved in front of the sunlit side of Earth. The series of test images shows the fully illuminated "far side" of the moon that is never visible from Earth.

Happy birthday little rover! 3 years of Mars Curiosity and more to come!  Since it landed on Mars in 2012  the Curiosity Rover has been seeking to determine if the Red Planet ever had conditions to support life. Curiosity carries a Canadian-made geology instrument called Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS)  which enables the rover to determine the chemical composition of the rocks and soil on Mars.   It has contributed significantly to some of the mission's top science breakthroughs  including the discovery that ancient Mars could have had the right chemistry for microbial life.  It was announced last June that the Canadian Space Agency invested to support the operations of APXS and its science team for two more years  allowing for even more research and discoveries!

It’s Raining Stars!  One of the most impressive annual meteor shower  the Perseids  will light up our summer skies in the coming days.  Even though the Perseids will reach their peak during the night of August 12 - 13  you can already hope to spot a few meteors when you look up at the sky.

This diagram shows orbits of the 69 Perseids already seen in NASA's wide-field meteor cameras (green and blue)  against the orbit of comet Swift-Tuttle  the parent body of the Perseids (purple). There is some spread in the meteoroid stream due to planetary perturbations  however most of this spread is due to errors in the orbit determination. The Perseids have highly eccentric orbits  which lends itself to higher errors in the orbits of these meteors.,HER,photo

Why is this meteor shower called the Perseids? Because the radiant (point in the sky which the meteors appear to come from) lies in the constellation Perseus! Here are radiants from this year's Perseids as seen in NASA's All Sky Fireball Network. Note: this does NOT mean that you should look towards Perseus to view them  rather look up and take in as much of the sky as possible. The Perseids will be seen all over the sky.,HER,photo
Make a wish…or many!  It is tonight that the famous Perseids will reach their peak! The best moment to observe this shower of shooting stars will be between 2:00 and 5:30 am  but you can expect to spot some meteors as soon as dawn sets. It is recommended to head away from city lights if possible. A many as 50 to 80 meteors per hour could be observed!  This spectacle happens when Earth passes really close to the orbital path of the Swift-Tuttle comet  which sheds some debris  resulting into an amazingly illuminated sky!  Look up to the sky and make…many wishes!  Our observation tips: http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/sciences/perseids.asp  Picture credit : Fred Bruenjes via NASA,HER,photo

APOD: 2015 August 17 - Andromeda Rising over the Alps   Have you ever seen the Andromeda galaxy? Although M31 appears as a faint and fuzzy blob to the unaided eye  the light you see will be over two million years old  making it likely the oldest light you ever will see directly. Now rising near a few hours after sunset from mid-latitude northern locations  Andromeda is rising earlier each night and will be visible to northerners all night long starting in September. The featured image captured Andromeda rising above the Italian Alps last month. As cool as it may be to see this neighboring galaxy to our Milky Way with your own eyes  long duration camera exposures can pick up many faint and breathtaking details. Recent data indicates that our Milky Way Galaxy will collide and coalesce with the slightly larger Andromeda galaxy in a few billion years.

Engineers are preparing to test the parachute system for NASA’s Orion spacecraft at the U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground in Yuma  Arizona. During the test  planned for Wednesday  Aug. 26  a C-17 aircraft will carry a representative Orion capsule to 35 000 feet in altitude and then drop it from its cargo bay. Engineers will test a scenario in which one of Orion’s two drogue parachutes  used to stabilize it in the air  does not deploy  and one of its three main parachutes  used to slow the capsule during the final stage of descent  also does not deploy. The risky test will provide data engineers will use as they gear up to qualify Orion’s parachutes for missions with astronauts. On Aug. 24  a C-17 was loaded with the test version of Orion  which has a similar mass and interfaces with the parachutes as the Orion being developed for deep space missions but is shorter on top to fit inside the aircraft.,HER,photo

Eiffel Tower Plume Seen on the Sun  A single plume of plasma  many times taller than the diameter of Earth  rose up from the Sun  twisted and spun around  all the while spewing streams of particles for over two days (Aug. 17-19  2015) before breaking apart. At times  its shape resembled the Eiffel Tower. Other lesser plumes and streams of particles can be seen dancing above the solar surface as well. The action was observed in a wavelength of extreme ultraviolet light.   Credit: NASA/Goddard/Solar Dynamics Observatory,HER,video

On Sept. 1  1961  crew members secure the X-15 rocket-powered aircraft after a research flight while the B-52 mothership used for launch does a low fly-by overhead.   The X-15s made a total of 199 flights over a period of nearly 10 years from 1959 to 1968  and set unofficial world speed and altitude records of 4 520 mph (Mach 6.7) and 354 200 feet. Information gained from the highly successful X-15 program contributed to the development of the Mercury  Gemini  and Apollo piloted spaceflight programs  and also the Space Shuttle program. #OTD #NASAHistory,HER,photo

#Hubble Survey Unlocks Clues to Starbirth in Andromeda Galaxy  Census of Over 2 700 Clusters Yields a Common Recipe for Making Stars  All stars are not created equal. They can vary in mass by over a factor of 1 000. Our sun is classified as a diminutive yellow dwarf. What’s more  stars are not born in isolation  but inside giant molecular clouds of hydrogen. The question has been: what fraction of stars precipitate out of these clouds into clusters that contain blue giants  yellow dwarfs  and red dwarfs? It’s like asking if all automobile manufacturers fabricate the same proportion of trucks  SUVs  sedans  and subcompacts.   The best way to address the question is not to look around our Milky Way – which we are inside — but far out into space to the neighboring Andromeda galaxy  2.5 million light-years away. Embedded in a sweeping Hubble mosaic of 117 million stars in the galaxy’s disk are 2 753 star clusters. Hubble astronomers found that  for whatever reason  nature apparently cooks up stars like batches of cookies. There is a consistent distribution from massive stars to small stars. It is surprising to find that this ratio is the same across our neighboring galaxy (as well as inside our stellar neighborhood in the Milky Way)  given the complex physics of star formation.

SETI reborn: The New Search for Intelligent Life | Astrobiology Magazine   In July 2015 Russian billionaire philanthropist Yuri Milner announced that his Breakthrough Prize Foundation would donate $100 million over the course of 10 years to fund the biggest SETI project ever attempted.

At best  its global annual funding was $1.5 million. With Milner’s millions  everything has changed.  Image credit: NRAO/AUI/NSF  Read more: http://buff.ly/1K2hsdR,HER,photo
As the sun sets over the Arctic  the end of this year’s melt season is quickly approaching and the sea ice cover has already shrunk to the fourth lowest in the satellite record. With possibly some days of melting left  the sea ice extent could still drop to the second or third lowest on record.  Arctic sea ice  which regulates the planet’s temperature by bouncing solar energy back to space  has been on a steep decline for the last two decades. This animation shows the evolution of Arctic sea ice in 2015  from its annual maximum wintertime extent  reached on February 25  to September 6.

We're fewer at the dinner table on the International Space Station tonight as our three friends await to return to Earth.   But when we were nine people aboard the space station  it's a bit of a full house. It's been a solid  busy week since Andy  Sergei and Aidyn joined the rest of us. It's not every day you get to work with such a unique crew comprised of good people from five different countries: Russia  USA  Denmark  Japan and Kazakhstan.  At the end of the day  the dinner table acts as a unifier  a place of community. Sharing a meal gives us a chance to put aside work and catch up with one another. While nutrition is important to us physically - maintaining our health and mitigating the negative effects of microgravity on our bodies - mealtime also is important to us psychologically.  Dining together can radically shift perspectives  blurring boundaries just as looking down on Earth from our vantage point  especially  when dinner partners are from all different corners of the world. But also mealtime lets us build a sense of camaraderie.  Andy  Aidyn and Gennady - whom I launched to the International Space Station with nearly six months ago - will begin their journey home today. I will miss those guys. They are good friends to break bread with.  Eat simply  and eat together. #YearInSpace  Watch this video and others during my year in space on YouTube > https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM-p4l2OPH_oX6tFrjKT-9A,HER,video

Higher Quality Version of Pluto's Largest Moon Charon  This image of Pluto’s largest moon Charon  taken by NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft 10 hours before its closest approach to Pluto on July 14  2015 from a distance of 290 000 miles (470 000 kilometers)  is a recently downlinked  much higher quality version of a Charon image released on July 15. Charon  which is 750 miles (1 200 kilometers) in diameter  displays a surprisingly complex geological history  including tectonic fracturing; relatively smooth  fractured plains in the lower right; several enigmatic mountains surrounded by sunken terrain features on the right side; and heavily cratered regions in the center and upper left portion of the disk. There are also complex reflectivity patterns on Charon’s surface  including bright and dark crater rays  and the conspicuous dark north polar region at the top of the image. The smallest visible features are 2.9 miles 4.6 kilometers) in size.

Jaw-dropping Andromeda galaxy photo comprises 37 hours of exposure  The image you see here  showing the Andromeda Galaxy in visible light  was captured and processed by two astrophotographers right here on Earth  US-based David Lane and Finland-based J-P Metsavainio.  For 37 hours (non-consecutive)  Lane trained his camera and telescope at the tiny section of sky wherein the Andromeda Galaxy lies. He shot 18 hours of visible light exposure  one hour through a hydrogen alpha filter to pick out ionised hydrogen details and six hours each with a red  green and blue filter.  The raw images obtained from these exposures were then sent to Metsavainio  who corrected the optical distortion caused by the telescope using CCDStack 2 software. He then combined the images and adjusted the levels and curves using PhotoShop CS3. This is similar to the processing applied to images obtained from space telescopes.

Child of the 80s? If you're in your early thirties (or younger...)  tonight is likely the first time you will encounter a rare Super Blood Moon Total Lunar Eclipse since the last one occurred in 1982.   For this rare eclipse to happen  three separate lunar events need to converge: a total lunar eclipse  when the Earth gets between the moon and the sun; the full moon nearest the equinox (called harvest or blood moon);  the moon at its closest point to the Earth (super moon or perigee moon)  a mere 356 877 km away  which makes it appear about 14% bigger.    The partial eclipse begins at 9:07 pm EDT to end at 12:27 am while the total eclipse will start at 10:11 pm to end at 11:23 pm EDT.   Be sure to go out and look up at the sky tonight. The next time we’ll be treated with such a rare lunar event will be in...2033! And unlike a solar eclipse  the lunar eclipse is safe to watch with the naked eyes!  When and where to see the eclipse via Space.com: http://www.space.com/30607-supermoon-lunar-eclipse-time-place-guide.html  Cloudy where you are?

Breaking news: Liquid water flows on #Mars today  boosting the odds that life could exist on the Red Planet.,HER,link
NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter found the best evidence yet of liquid water on present-day Mars.  Info: http://go.nasa.gov/1LXyrwd,HER,photo
New findings from a NASA robotic orbiter provide the strongest evidence yet that liquid water flows on present-day Mars. "This is a significant development  as it appears to confirm that water -- albeit briny -- is flowing today on the surface of Mars " said John Grunsfeld  associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. Get the details: http://go.nasa.gov/1LK1EyQ,HER,photo
Liquid water flows on present-day Mars! Researchers using our Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter detected signatures of hydrated minerals on slopes where mysterious dark streaks are seen on the Red Planet. Scientists say it’s likely a shallow subsurface flow  with enough water wicking to the surface to explain the darkening. This is a significant science discovery on our quest to send humans on a #JourneyToMars. Details: http://go.nasa.gov/1Lh2Ivw,HER,photo
"This is a significant development  as it appears to confirm that water...is flowing today on the surface of Mars.” #MarsAnnouncement,HER,link
Liquid Water on Mars is Big News  Water on Mars?  It’s an old story from the Red Planet  and the facts are that landers have frequently found water in the form of ice just below the surface.  But NASA has just announced new results based on high-resolution imagery from NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter satellite showing that liquid water also occasionally flows on the surface.  This conclusion is based on spectroscopic analysis of dark  seasonal streaks on the sides of craters and other features known as “recurrent slope lineae ” which look like long fingers that appear and lengthen during the martian summers.  For years  there’s been argument about what is causing the lineae: Is it really water  or could it be something else – even dry material slowly tumbling down the slopes?  The argument is apparently over.  The new results come down heavily in favor of water – highly salty  yes  but liquid water.  Read more: http://buff.ly/1Lhbw4C,HER,photo

APOD: 2015 September 29 - Supermoon Total Lunar Eclipse and Lightning Storm  What's more rare than a supermoon total lunar eclipse? How about a supermoon total lunar eclipse over a lightning storm. Such an electrifying sequence was captured yesterday from Ibiza  an island in southeastern Spain. After planning the location for beauty  and the timing to capture the entire eclipse sequence  the only thing that had to cooperate for this astrophotographer to capture a memorable eclipse sequence was the weather. What looked to be a bother on the horizon  though  turned out to be a blessing. The composite picture features over 200 digitally combined images from the same location over the course of a night. The full moon is seen setting as it faded to red in Earth's shadow and then returned to normal. The fortuitous lightning is seen reflected in the Mediterranean to the right of the 400-meter tall rocky island of Es Vedra. Although the next total eclipse of a large and bright supermoon will occur in 2033  the next total eclipse of any full moon will occur in January 2018 and be best visible from eastern Asia and Australia.

APOD: 2015 October 5 - Orion Over and Under Tibet  This night was so serene you could see Orion rise downwards. The unusual spectacle was captured in this single-exposure image  featuring a deep sky around the famous constellation of Orion that appeared both above -- and reflected in -- a peaceful lake in the Gyirong Valley of Tibet  China. Taken last year at this time  the three belt stars of Orion can be seen lined up almost vertically above and below the Himalayan Mountains. The complex Orion Nebula can be seen to the belt stars' right  while the red-glowing circular structure surrounding Orion is Barnard's Loop. Also  the bright red star Betelgeuse is doubly visible on the image left  while bright blue Rigel appears twice on the image right. Familiar Orion is becoming increasingly visible as Winter (Summer) descends on the Northern (Southern) hemisphere.  Image Credit & Copyright: Jeff Dai  Larger image: http://buff.ly/1OgWxbh,HER,photo

Earth's Gravitational Pull Cracks Open the Moon  Just as the moon's gravitational pull causes seas and lakes to rise and fall as tides on Earth  the Earth exerts tidal forces on the moon. Scientists have known this for a while  but now they've found that Earth's pull actually opens up faults on the moon.  Researchers analyzed data from NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) and detected more than 3 200 fault scarps. These cliffs are the most common tectonic feature on the moon  and are typically dozens of yards or meters high and less than about 6 miles (10 kilometers) long.   "There is a pattern in the orientations of the thousands of faults  and it suggests something else is influencing their formation  something that's also acting on a global scale " researcher Thomas Watters said in a statement. "That something is the Earth's gravitational pull."   Image credit: NASA/LRO/Arizona State University/Smithsonian Institution  Read more: http://buff.ly/1Pc4IpC,HER,photo

The Most Mysterious Star in Our Galaxy   The light pattern suggests there is a big mess of matter circling the star  in tight formation. That would be expected if the star were young. When our solar system first formed  four and a half billion years ago  a messy disk of dust and debris surrounded the sun  before gravity organized it into planets  and rings of rock and ice.  But this unusual star isn’t young. If it were young  it would be surrounded by dust that would give off extra infrared light. There doesn’t seem to be an excess of infrared light around this star.  It appears to be mature.  Image credit:  Kevin Morefield  Read more: http://buff.ly/1X09Mi7,HER,link

Scientists expected the north polar region of Enceladus to be heavily cratered  but the new high-resolution Cassini images show a landscape of stark contrasts. "The northern regions are crisscrossed by a spidery network of gossamer-thin cracks that slice through the craters " said Paul Helfenstein  a member of the Cassini imaging team at Cornell University.

Captured from Rio de Janeiro  Brazil  the four bright stars that mark the Southern Cross are visible just above the horizon in the featured image. On the left of this constellation  also known as The Crux  is the orange star Gamma Crucis. The band of stars  dust  and gas rising through the middle of the image mosaic is part our Milky Way Galaxy. Just to the right of the Southern Cross is the dark Coal Sack Nebula  and the bright nebula at the top of the image is the Carina Nebula. The Southern Cross is such a famous constellation that it is depicted on the national flag of Australia.  Image Credit & Copyright: Carlos Fairbairn  Larger image: http://buff.ly/1LYDJqI,HER,photo

Search For Intelligent Aliens Near Bizarre Dimming Star Has Begun   The search for signs of life in a mysterious star system hypothesized to potentially harbor an "alien megastructure" is now underway.  Astronomers have begun using the Allen Telescope Array (ATA)  a system of radio dishes about 300 miles (483 kilometers) northeast of San Francisco  to hunt for signals coming from the vicinity of KIC 8462852  a star that lies 1 500 light-years from Earth.  NASA's Kepler space telescope found that KIC 8462852 dimmed oddly and dramatically several times over the past few years. The dimming events were far too substantial to be caused by a planet crossing the star's face  researchers say  and other possible explanations  such as an enormous dust cloud  don't add up  either.  "We are looking at it with the Allen Telescope Array " said Seth Shostak  a senior astronomer at the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Institute in Mountain View  California.  "No problem with that; I think we ought to  for sure " Shostak told Space.com. But  he added  people "should perhaps moderate their enthusiasm with the lessons of history."

Alien Engineering Around Strange Star? | by Seth Shostak  Senior Astronomer  There's a new big dipper in the nighttime sky.  No  it's not a cozy constellation  but a distant  non-descript star that behaves like a shipboard semaphore  beaming flashes of light into the cosmic darkness that seem random  but may not be.  While the luminous output from everyday stars is relentlessly steady  this one occasionally dips its brightness as much as 20 percent  suggesting either that it is orbited by lumps of dust  rock or other opaque material  or - and hang onto your desk chair - there are residents in this stellar system who have deliberately built hardware of a size and extent big enough to intercept a substantial amount of their sun's output. In that case  what we're seeing is the consequence of a massive  alien construction project.  Seriously? Could this star  lovingly named KIC 846 2852 - a fairly ordinary stellar orb roughly half-again as big as our Sun and nearly five times brighter - be home to some advanced society that's solving its energy crisis by constructing what's called a Dyson sphere (or more practically  a Dyson swarm): a phalanx of solar panels that orbit their sun  turn oodles of starlight into electricity  and then beam that energy back to the home planet to power their fossil fuel-free lifestyle?  Well  that's certainly a possibility.   Read more: http://buff.ly/1RZFuJA,HER,link

Here's What Happens If Intelligent Life Is Discovered  (Includes interviews with Seth Shostak and Jill Tarter.)  If all signs indicate that the signal is coming from another star  the astronomers contact other observatories or research organizations that subscribe to the Post-Detection Protocols to confirm a) that the signal exists  and b) that it’s likely coming from an intelligent source. If the other groups confirm the the signal  the original astronomers sound the alarm  alerting their national authorities of the discovery and sending an International Astronomical Union “telegram”—these days  an email—to observatories around the world. The guidelines also account for the United Nations’s 1967 Space Treaty  which calls for member states to notify the U.N. of their space-exploration activity—under the Protocols  the discovering astronomer alerts the Secretary General to the discovery  as well as a number of other international bodies.

The Mysterious Star KIC 8462852 | by Seth Shostak  SETI Institute  The SETI Institute is following up on the possibility that the stellar system KIC 8462852 might be home to an advanced civilization.  This star  slightly brighter than the Sun and more than 1400 light-years away  has been the subject of scrutiny by NASA’s Kepler space telescope.  It has shown some surprising behavior that’s odd even by the generous standards of cosmic phenomena.  KIC 8462852 occasionally dims by as much as 20 percent  suggesting that there is some material in orbit around this star that blocks its light.   For various reasons  it’s obvious that this material is not simply a planet.  A favored suggestion is that it is debris from comets that have been drawn into relatively close orbit to the star.  But another  and obviously intriguing  possibility is that this star is home to a technologically sophisticated society that has constructed a phalanx of orbiting solar panels (a so-called Dyson swarm) that block light from the star.,HER,link

A suggestively shaped reflection nebula  this cosmic crone is about 800 light-years away though. Its frightening visage seems to glare toward nearby bright star Rigel in Orion  just off the right edge of this frame. More formally known as IC 2118  the interstellar cloud of dust and gas is nearly 70 light-years across  its dust grains reflecting Rigel's starlight. In this composite portrait  the nebula's color is caused not only by the star's intense bluish light but because the dust grains scatter blue light more efficiently than red. The same physical process causes Earth's daytime sky to appear blue  although the scatterers in planet Earth's atmosphere are molecules of nitrogen and oxygen.

'Alien megastructure' update: SETI telescope doesn't hear E.T. | Geekwire  Alan Boyle  The SETI Institute says it hasn’t detected any alien radio signals coming from a star whose light seems to be dimming in a weird way  but it’s too early to determine what kind of phenomenon is behind the pattern.  Despite the non-detection  KIC 8462852 remains a high-value target for further observation.  “You can expect more people to look at it ” Shostak told GeekWire. “Everybody who has access to a big telescope  either a radio telescope or an optical telescope  is going to try to find out anything they can learn about this system.”,HER,link

Fireball! The annual Taurid meteor shower is taking place from November 5-12! Shooting stars are caused by tiny pieces of debris that burn up in our atmosphere  and the Taurids tend to result from larger pieces of debris than usual  which creates “fireballs”—jaw-dropping meteors that streak across the sky. The 2015 Taurids may be exceptionally spectacular: the Moon isn’t too bright  and the Earth is passing through a denser field of debris than usual  which may mean more fireballs. Keep your eyes on the skies for the Taurids  and don't forget to make a wish!  http://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/articles/taurid-meteor-shower-sends-fireballs-shooting-across-the-sky/59356/ Photo: NASA/Hiroyuki Iida,HER,photo

Carl Sagan 1934 – 1996  He was a once-in-a-generation scientist who could make research both understandable and exciting to the lay public.  Carl Sagan arguably did more for the cause of science – and especially for astronomy and space research – than many of the personages featured in college textbooks.  Today is Carl Sagan’s 81st birthday; he died too young  at age 62.  But his formidable legacy continues to wield influence: anyone who has talked to students of astronomy has heard claims that they were attracted to the field thanks to Carl Sagan.   In addition to hosting the most popular science television show of its time (“Cosmos”)  Sagan authored more than a dozen books.  His efforts in the 1960s to make an early Russian tome  “Intelligent Life in the Universe ” available to English audiences brought SETI to the attention of mass audiences.  In addition to being a principal player in some of the most significant early explorations of our solar system (most notably  the Viking missions to Mars)  Sagan participated in some pioneering SETI experiments  and – in the last year of his life –became a member of the SETI Institute’s Board of Trustees.  He brought science into the living rooms and ultimately the consciousness of millions of people.  Few have done so much.,HER,photo

Orion the Hunter welcomes in winter  As if the early sunsets don’t put you in mind of winter  the midevening appearance of the season’s most conspicuous constellation surely will.   Orion the Hunter now rises low in the eastern sky at 10 p.m. local time and appears halfway to the zenith in the southeast by midnight. Look for three 2nd-magnitude stars in a line that form the Hunter’s belt. The constellation’s brightest stars are ruddy Betelgeuse and blue-white Rigel.  Ismael Rodriguez took this image of Orion setting over the Chiricahua Mountains in southern Arizona. Coppery Betelgeuse (Alpha Orionis) lies near the top and Rigel (Beta Orionis) is the brilliant star closest to the mountains at bottom.

A supermassive black hole in action  The yellow-hued object at the centre of the frame is an elliptical galaxy known as Hercules A  seen by the Earth-orbiting NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope. In normal light  an observer would only see this object floating in the inky blackness of space.  However  view Hercules A with a radio telescope  and the entire region is completely transformed. Stunning red–pink jets of material can be seen billowing outwards from the galaxy – jets that are completely invisible in visible light. They are shown here as seen by the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array radio observatory in New Mexico  USA. These radio observations were combined with the Hubble visible-light data obtained with the Wide Field Camera 3 to create this striking composite.  Image credit: NASA  ESA  S. Baum & C.

APOD: 2015 November 23 - A 212 Hour Exposure of Orion  The constellation of Orion is much more than three stars in a row. It is a direction in space that is rich with impressive nebulas. To better appreciate this well-known swath of sky  an extremely long exposure was taken over many clear nights in 2013 and 2014. After 212 hours of camera time and an additional year of processing  the featured 1400-exposure collage spanning over 40 times the angular diameter of the Moon emerged. Of the many interesting details that have become visible  one that particularly draws the eye is Barnard's Loop  the bright red circular filament arcing down from the middle. The Rosette Nebula is not the giant red nebula near the top of the image -- that is a larger but lesser known nebula known as Lambda Orionis. The Rosette Nebula is visible  though: it is the red and white nebula on the upper left. The bright orange star just above the frame center is Betelgeuse  while the bright blue star on the lower right is Rigel. Other famous nebulas visible include the Witch Head Nebula  the Flame Nebula  the Fox Fur Nebula  and  if you know just where to look  the comparatively small Horsehead Nebula. About those famous three stars that cross the belt of Orion the Hunter -- in this busy frame they can be hard to locate  but a discerning eye will find them just below and to the right of the image center.

Where Alice in Wonderland meets Albert Einstein  One hundred years ago this month  Albert Einstein published his theory of general relativity  one of the most important scientific achievements in the last century.  The latest results from the "Cheshire Cat" group of galaxies show how manifestations of Einstein's 100-year-old theory can lead to new discoveries today. Astronomers have given the group this name because of the smiling cat-like appearance. Some of the feline features are actually distant galaxies whose light has been stretched and bent by the large amounts of mass  most of which is in the form of dark matter detectable only through its gravitational effect  found in the system.  Astronomers think the Cheshire Cat group will become what is known as a fossil group  defined as a gathering of galaxies that contains one giant elliptical galaxy and other much smaller  fainter ones. Fossil groups may represent a temporary stage that nearly all galaxy groups pass through at some point in their evolution. Therefore  astronomers are eager to better understand the properties and behavior of these groups.

NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center (then Dryden) flew two prototype F-16XL aircraft in a variety of aeronautical research projects in the early and mid 1990s. The aircraft were developed from basic F-16 airframes  with the most notable difference being the delta (cranked arrow) wing. This gave the aircraft a greater range because of increased fuel capacity in the wing tanks and a larger load capability due to increased wing area.

NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center (then Dryden) used an F-18 Hornet fighter aircraft as its High Angle-of-Attack (Alpha) Research Vehicle (HARV) in a three-phased flight research project lasting from April 1987 until September 1996. The HARV aircraft had unfortunately been used as a source of spare parts by the Navy  which never expected the aircraft would fly again. It arrived at Dryden in pieces aboard a semitrailer in October 1984  missing 400 parts and having very little documentation on its existing wiring system. Dryden mechanics and technicians had to find substitute parts  cut out all the existing wiring  then assemble the aircraft and rewire it. When they completed the job  they painted the words "Silk Purse" on the side of the fuselage to indicate what they had made from the "Sow's Ear" of cannibalized aircraft parts with which they had begun.

Water World: Saturn's moon Enceladus and the rings. Although both Enceladus and the ring particles are made up largely of water ice  they are very different. The small ring particles are too tiny to retain internal heat and have no way to get warm  so they are frozen and geologically dead. Enceladus  on the other hand  is subject to forces that heat its interior to this very day. This results in its famous south polar water jets--which are just visible here above the moon’s dark  southern limb--along with a sub-surface ocean. Details: http://go.nasa.gov/1l2KDpF,HER,photo

How SDSS Uses Light to Measure the Mass of Stars in Galaxies  Stars of different masses have distinctive spectra (and colours)  as first famously classified by Astronomer Annie Jump Cannon in the late 1890s into the OBAFGKM stellar sequence. O stars (at the top left of the HR diagram) are massive  hot  blue and with very strong emission lines  while M stars (at the lower right) are low mass  red and show absorption features from metallic lines in their atmospheres.  Using data from SDSS (and other surveys) astronomers use this method to decode the galaxy light – in fact we can use either the total light observed through different filters in the SDSS imaging  to match the colours of the stars  or if we measure the spectrum of the galaxy we can fit a population of stars to this instead.

Moonset and Milky Way  Astrophotographer Brook Wassall submitted a photo of the moon setting  taken at Niarbyl on the Isle of Man  on Sept. 18  2015. Wassall writes in an email message to Space.com: "Here you can see the moon setting on the right [allowing] the Milky Way to shine [brightly] in the night sky. This was a bit of a tricky image to get as this was taken just after low tide  with the water slowly creeping into my shoes as I [balanced] myself on a couple of slippery rocks  but the low tide enabled me to get as far out as I could to capture the reflections of the [surrounding] light on the water. With the tide slowly creeping in further and further  and the moon quickly setting on the horizon  I had little time before the window of opportunity was gone. The Isle of Man sits in the middle of the Irish Sea  and although the island itself has very low light pollution  it is surrounded by the UK and Ireland which can shine quite [brightly] from across the sea in the night. The light pollution seen on the horizon in this image is actually coming all the way from Dublin  Ireland."   Image credit: Brook Wassall  Larger image: http://buff.ly/1QdAstM,HER,photo

However  last night  the Voragine crater unleashed a lava fountain that reached 1 kilometer (~3 200 feet) over the volcano with an accompanying ash plume that topped 3 kilometers (~9 800 feet). Even with all that intensity of eruption  the paroxysm was over in only 50 minutes.  Image credit: MARCO RESTIVO/DEMOTIX/CORBIS  Read more: http://buff.ly/1lzqqrb,HER,photo

APOD: 2015 December 7 - Comet Catalina Emerges  Comet Catalina is ready for its close-up. The giant snowball from the outer Solar System  known formally as C/2013 US10 (Catalina)  rounded the Sun last month and is now headed for its closest approach to Earth in January. With the glow of the Moon now also out of the way  morning observers in Earth's northern hemisphere are getting their best ever view of the new comet. And Comet Catalina is not disappointing. Although not as bright as early predictions  the comet is sporting both dust (lower left) and ion (upper right) tails  making it an impressive object for binoculars and long-exposure cameras. The featured image was taken last week from the Canary Islands  off the northwest coast of Africa. Sky enthusiasts around the world will surely be tracking the comet over the next few months to see how it evolves.

EPOD: A Supernova Remnant in Cygnus  This image shows a 5 000 - 8 000-year-old supernova remnant in the constellation Cygnus known as the Veil Nebula. If you can imagine this region being filled with a spherical shell of ionized gases  then the reason we see the bright crescent-shaped strips to the right and left is because here we're looking through the thickest layers of gas. The bright crescent-shaped strip on the right is also called the Witch's Broom Nebula. Towards the center of the image  where we see through the thinnest gas layers  we hardly see any light emission at all from ionized gas. Red emission is from ionized hydrogen atoms (HII)  and the green-blue emission is from ionized oxygen (OIII). The diameter of the Veil Nebula is approximately 3 degrees  where the diameter of a full Moon is just half a degree.   Image credit: Greg Parker  Larger image: http://buff.ly/1RfSEEQ,HER,photo
German scientists achieve ‘landmark breakthrough’ in nuclear fusion  German scientists say they have reached a milestone in a quest to derive energy from nuclear fusion  billed as a potentially limitless  safe and cheap source. The success comes as a culmination of a nearly two decade project  Nuclear fusion entails fusing atoms together to generate energy — a process similar to that in the Sun — as opposed to nuclear fission  where atoms are split  which entails worries over safety and long-term waste.

The head of advertising shouts  "Of course!" and gives the intern a promotion. What this has to do with cycling (from Bicycling Magazine  June 2010 issue) or mobile technology is unclear  but apparently Radio Shack has discovered that Lance powers THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE! No wonder he's won all those Tours... Image entry by drcreneejames,LER,photo

[Know more] The habitable zone is the distance from a star where one can have liquid water on the surface of a planet. If a planet is too close to its parent star  it will be too hot and water would have evaporated. If a planet is too far from a star it is too cold and water is frozen. Stars come in a wide variety of sizes  masses and temperatures. Stars that are smaller  cooler and lower mass than the Sun (M-dwarfs) have their habitable zone much closer to the star than the Sun (G-dwarf). Stars that are larger  hotter and more massive than the Sun (A-dwarfs) have their habitable zone much farther out from the star.,LER,link

Three different antennas (dish-type radio telescopes) of the Deep Space Network (DSN) pass by one at a time below as Earth turns. Your job in the game is to aim the moving antenna at a spacecraft  transmit a command  then receive 100% of the data sent back from as many as five spacecraft before the game is over.

[Journey Log] On this same day  year 1745  died Jonathan Swift  Irish author  linked  linked to an enigma in the history of astronomy. Although Deimos and Phobos  Mars' moons  were not discovered until 1877  Swift wrote in 1720  in Gulliver's Travels  that the inhabitants of Laputa had made important astronomical observations including the two satellites of Mars  one orbiting with a period 10 hours and the other with a period of 21 hours. All sorts of theories appeared to explain the amazing coincidence. That Mars should have two satellites was an old idea  which Kepler had expressed in 1610 and others had elaborated further. But guessing the periods and distances of Deimos and Phobos to within 30% is a less likely coincidence. Will we ever know how?,LER,link

Over the holidays at the end of 1992  Lloyd Robinson  the CCD guru at UCO Lick in those days  had just retired and offered to set up a CCD system in the clean room in Santa Cruz to see what could be learned.  This star plate was a key component in that original setup.    When Jon Jenkins (Co-Investigator and Analysis Lead for Kepler) first set eyes on this plate in June  2010  he recognized it immediately  even though he had never seen it before. This was because one of his first tasks for the mission was the analysis of an untold number of images from a variety of tests using this plate. These tests were invaluable in discovering all sorts of ways for test setups to go wrong  from sagging light bulb filaments to liquid nitrogen fills. Based on what was learned  more sophisticated laboratory test systems were developed using a variety of other star plates. This painstaking laboratory work culminated in the very successful Kepler Test Demonstration (KTD)  which was instrumental in selling the Kepler Mission to NASA.

EVE was able to produce the first SDO science result soon after launch  long before the instruments opened their doors. Only one of EVE's channels was activated  and fortunately this channel was sensitive to the extremely high-energy protons in Earth's radiation belts. As SDO's orbit made its ascent to geosynch  EVE mapped out the Earth's radiation environment.  Credit: NASA SDO,LER,video

The first movie segment showing the detected travel-time perturbations before the emergence of active region 10488 in the photosphere. The first 10 seconds of the movie show intensity observations of the Sun. The intensity later fades out and the photospheric magnetic field is shown. In the next 20 seconds  we zoom in to a region where a sunspot group would emerge. The upper layer shows magnetic field observations at the surface and the lower layer shows simultaneous travel-time perturbations  detected at a depth of about 60 000 km. After the emergence  intensity observations show the full development of this active region  until it rotates out of view on the west solar limb.  The second movie segment showing the detected travel-time perturbations during the emergence of active region 11158. The first 12 seconds of the movie show photospheric intensity observations (orange color) of the region  and travel-time perturbations detected at a depth of about 60 000 km (blue-red color). The movie then shows sunspots (blue and orange) on the solar surface and coronal loops (light green) observed by SDO/AIA.

SOHO Greats! - More Looks Under the "Covers" with SOHO/MDI  Two active regions and their subsurface structures are the main characters of another "inside story" from the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) instrument on SOHO. Active region 9393 (first set of sunspots) was studied in detail by a group led by Alexander Kosovichev at Stanford. Using data from the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) instrument on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft to infer the sub-surface structure beneath the region  the team found that such regions are comprised of many small magnetic structures that rise quickly from deep within the Sun.  Active region 9114 (second set of sunspots) was studied by another team led by Junwei Zhao  also of Stanford  using SOHO MDI to explore the structure beneath a sunspot to understand why they sometimes start rotating. Zhao's team discovered that there was a strong plasma vortex beneath the rotating sunspot and that the magnetic fields lacing the sunspot appeared to be twisted beneath the surface.  credit: SOHO/NASA/ESA,LER,video

It's almost a little sad when you think about it: Originally as part of a much larger object  Comet Lovejoy has existed for billions of years  since the formation of the solar system. It has outlived countless species on Earth. Indeed  it existed before life on Earth! And now it will almost certainly be completely destroyed within 72hrs. That is a long time spent doing very litte  to have such a short remaining time doing so much. But while it may have gone through most of its existence unnoticed  the same can certainly not be said now as increasing numbers of astronomers and enthusiasts alike are following its spectacular demise. For ground-based observers  the comet is now all but lost in the blinding glare of the Sun. But for Sun-watching spacecraft such as SOHO and STEREO  it is an incresingly easy target to view  and that is exactly what we are doing.   Thank you Sungrazer Team at NRL (Naval Research Laboratory),LER,video
Thank you Discovery News for listening two Sun/Solar stories in your Space Story of 2011. I truly think that the Epic Solar Flare story is worth watching and voting for. But I must admit  the other stories are as great! Go vote and have fun. ,LER,link

AIA 335: This channel (as well as AIA 211) highlights the active region of the outer atmosphere of the Sun – the corona. Active regions  solar flares  and coronal mass ejections will appear bright here. The dark areas – or coronal holes – are places where very little radiation is emitted  yet are the main source of solar wind particles.  Where: Active regions of the corona Wavelength:  335 angstroms (0.0000000335 m) = Extreme Ultraviolet  Primary ions seen:  15 times ionized iron (Fe XVI) Characteristic temperature: 2.8 million K (5 million ˚F)  Credit: NASA SDO,LER,photo
AIA 1700: This channel (as well as AIA 1600) often shows a web-like pattern of bright areas that highlight places where bundles of magnetic fields lines are concentrated. However  small areas with a lot of field lines will appear black  usually near sunspots and active regions.   Where: Temperature minimum and photosphere Wavelength:  1700 angstroms (0.00000017 m) = Far Ultraviolet  Primary ions seen:  Continuum Characteristic temperature: 6 000 K (11 000 ˚F)  Credit: NASA SDO,LER,photo

The EVE instrument is the 3rd instrument on SDO.   This channel is a lower resolution image (approx. 256x256 pixels) of the Sun in the wavelength range from 0.1-7nm. Because this is a large wavelength range  there are many different emissions from ions as well as continuum emissions with this band. This image clearly shows where active regions and flares occur.   Where: Active regions of the corona and flares.  Wavelength: 0.1-7 nm (Soft X-rays) Primary ions seen: Lots of highly ionized emissions and the free-free continuum (this is a very broadband  large wavelength range channel).

The M1-class solar flare seen through 171 angstroms at 19:09 UT.   This channel is especially good at showing coronal loops - the arcs extending off of the Sun where plasma moves along magnetic field lines. The brightest spots seen here are locations where the magnetic field near the surface is exceptionally strong.  Credit: NASA SDO,LER,photo
Also at 19:09 UT but seen through 304 angstrom  the M1-class flare can be seen looking bright.   This channel is especially good at showing areas where cooler dense plumes of plasma (filaments and prominences) are located above the visible surface of the Sun. Many of these features either can’t be seen or appear as dark lines in the other channels. The bright areas show places where the plasma has a high density.  Credit: NASA SDO,LER,photo

And here is my first video from today's rather huge solar flare. Right at midnight UT time the active region 1429 unleashed a powerful X5.4-class solar flare. X-class flares are the strongest of the flares. They are major events that can trigger planet-wide radio blackouts and long-lasting radiation storms.

And here is my first video from today's rather huge solar flare. Right at midnight UT time the active region 1429 unleashed a powerful X5.4-class solar flare. X-class flares are the strongest of the flares. They are major events that can trigger planet-wide radio blackouts and long-lasting radiation storms.  It appears that right after the large X5.4 flare another slightly lower  X1 flare (5 times smaller)  occurred. You can clearly see a wave going across the Sun.   We are still gathering data and the Space Weather Forecast Lab will be having updates available soon.   Credit: NASA SDO,LER,video

The NASA fireball cameras in New Mexico picked up our first 3 Lyrids last night! They had peak magnitudes of -1.5  -3  and -3 (Mars/Jupiter brightness)  and burned up between 83 and 91 km altitude (51.6 and 56.6 miles in U.S. units); average speed was 46.3 km/sec  or 103 600 mph. You can easily identify the 3 Lyrids in this orbit plot by the similarity of their orbits.,LER,photo

The NASA fireball camera at the Tellus Museum in Cartersville  Georgia caught these nearly simultaneous fireballs at 5:44 AM EDT on May 6. The first is a faint streak just a bit above and to the right of the center of the image; the second - which is much brighter- immediately follows off to the right at the top edge of the clouds. These were not automatically picked up in our other cameras  so we do not have trajectories and cannot definitively identify them as eta Aquarids. However  an overlay of the star field (link below) suggests that they probably are  as the meteors appear to originate from close to the meteor shower radiant (the plus sign labeled ETA).  http://fireballs.ndc.nasa.gov/special/eAQR_2012/dbl_eta_Aqr.jpg,LER,video

Smooth operator: Dextre’s Duty Log for Day 1 of RRM RRM operations resumed on June 19  2012  on board the International Space Station. With Dextre being operated from the Canadian Space Agency in Saint-Hubert  Quebec  the robotic handyman put in a 19-hour day of smooth operations as part of a mission to demonstrate how satellites could be serviced in space.  Dextre began work by retrieving the Multifunction Tool developed by NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center  and then picked up the t-valve adapter (one of three for the tool). Dextre then used the adapter to remove the t-valve (a 2-way valve similar to the one under your sink at home) and stowed both the valve and its adapter in a compartment on the module. He then picked up a second adapter (the ambient cap adapter) in preparation for his next series of tasks on June 20.  Read more about RRM: http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/iss/dextre/rrm.asp,LER,link
Slow and Steady – Dextre’s Duty Log for Day 2 of RRM Robotics operations on board the International Space Station continued on June 20  2012  as Dextre successfully completed two more tasks in the Robotic Refueling Mission (RRM). Since the mission is designed to demonstrate how a robot could service a satellite in space  many of Dextre’s tasks are analogous to the steps you would do yourself to fuel up your own vehicle.  With the NASA-built Multifunction Tool still in hand  Dextre used one of the tool’s adapters to unscrew the ambient cap (much like unscrewing and removing the gas cap on an average car). The robotic handyman then stowed both the cap and its adapter in a compartment on the module. Afterwards  Dextre grasped another adapter and put it through a series of thorough checkouts before extracting it from its receptacle. Dextre will use the adapter when robotic work on RRM continues on Day 3.  For more informatio on RRM: http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/iss/dextre/rrm.asp,LER,link

RRM: Dextre’s Duty Log for Day 3  Dextre capped off three days of success for the Robotic Refueling Mission (RRM) on June 21  2012. Using the Multifunction Tool built by NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center  Dextre used an adapter to perform a series of intricate ops beneath the RRM ambient cap  including using a plunger inside the tool to simulate breaking the seal on a fuel tank—an essential step in refueling a real satellite (the fuel tank on most satellites is sealed up prior to launch  since they are usually not designed to be repaired). One of the goals of RRM is to demonstrate how robots could perform the tasks necessary for refueling and servicing a satellite in space.   After completing work on the plug and ambient cap  Dextre then picked up another adapter for the Multifunction Tool (similar to a multi-bit screwdriver—Dextre switched adapters throughout the three days much like a handyman changes the tips for a screwdriver). Dextre succeeded in fitting the adapter on a tertiary cap on the RRM module  a task which required minute precision  and which is even difficult for human hands. Afterwards  Dextre stowed the multifunction tool and its adapter in the RRM tool bay and conducted some tests on a nozzle tool that will be used during the next phase of RRM  when Dextre will simulate refueling the RRM mock satellite.

TEXT OF PRESIDENT JOHN KENNEDY'S RICE STADIUM MOON SPEECH  President Pitzer  Mr. Vice President  Governor  Congressman Thomas  Senator Wiley  and Congressman Miller  Mr. Webb  Mr. Bell  scientists  distinguished guests  and ladies and gentlemen:  I appreciate your president having made me an honorary visiting professor  and I will assure you that my first lecture will be very brief.  I am delighted to be here  and I'm particularly delighted to be here on this occasion.  We meet at a college noted for knowledge  in a city noted for progress  in a State noted for strength  and we stand in need of all three  for we meet in an hour of change and challenge  in a decade of hope and fear  in an age of both knowledge and ignorance. The greater our knowledge increases  the greater our ignorance unfolds.  Despite the striking fact that most of the scientists that the world has ever known are alive and working today  despite the fact that this Nation¹s own scientific manpower is doubling every 12 years in a rate of growth more than three times that of our population as a whole  despite that  the vast stretches of the unknown and the unanswered and the unfinished still far outstrip our collective comprehension.  No man can fully grasp how far and how fast we have come  but condense  if you will  the 50 000 years of man¹s recorded history in a time span of but a half-century. Stated in these terms  we know very little about the first 40 years  except at the end of them advanced man had learned to use the skins of animals to cover them. Then about 10 years ago  under this standard  man emerged from his caves to construct other kinds of shelter. Only five years ago man learned to write and use a cart with wheels. Christianity began less than two years ago. The printing press came this year  and then less than two months ago  during this whole 50-year span of human history  the steam engine provided a new source of power.  Newton explored the meaning of gravity. Last month electric lights and telephones and automobiles and airplanes became available. Only last week did we develop penicillin and television and nuclear power  and now if America's new spacecraft succeeds in reaching Venus  we will have literally reached the stars before midnight tonight.  This is a breathtaking pace  and such a pace cannot help but create new ills as it dispels old  new ignorance  new problems  new dangers. Surely the opening vistas of space promise high costs and hardships  as well as high reward.  So it is not surprising that some would have us stay where we are a little longer to rest  to wait. But this city of Houston  this State of Texas  this country of the United States was not built by those who waited and rested and wished to look behind them. This country was conquered by those who moved forward--and so will space.  William Bradford  speaking in 1630 of the founding of the Plymouth Bay Colony  said that all great and honorable actions are accompanied with great difficulties  and both must be enterprised and overcome with answerable courage.  If this capsule history of our progress teaches us anything  it is that man  in his quest for knowledge and progress  is determined and cannot be deterred. The exploration of space will go ahead  whether we join in it or not  and it is one of the great adventures of all time  and no nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay behind in the race for space.  Those who came before us made certain that this country rode the first waves of the industrial revolutions  the first waves of modern invention  and the first wave of nuclear power  and this generation does not intend to founder in the backwash of the coming age of space. We mean to be a part of it--we mean to lead it. For the eyes of the world now look into space  to the moon and to the planets beyond  and we have vowed that we shall not see it governed by a hostile flag of conquest  but by a banner of freedom and peace. We have vowed that we shall not see space filled with weapons of mass destruction  but with instruments of knowledge and understanding.  Yet the vows of this Nation can only be fulfilled if we in this Nation are first  and  therefore  we intend to be first. In short  our leadership in science and in industry  our hopes for peace and security  our obligations to ourselves as well as others  all require us to make this effort  to solve these mysteries  to solve them for the good of all men  and to become the world's leading space-faring nation.  We set sail on this new sea because there is new knowledge to be gained  and new rights to be won  and they must be won and used for the progress of all people. For space science  like nuclear science and all technology  has no conscience of its own. Whether it will become a force for good or ill depends on man  and only if the United States occupies a position of pre-eminence can we help decide whether this new ocean will be a sea of peace or a new terrifying theater of war. I do not say the we should or will go unprotected against the hostile misuse of space any more than we go unprotected against the hostile use of land or sea  but I do say that space can be explored and mastered without feeding the fires of war  without repeating the mistakes that man has made in extending his writ around this globe of ours.  There is no strife  no prejudice  no national conflict in outer space as yet. Its hazards are hostile to us all. Its conquest deserves the best of all mankind  and its opportunity for peaceful cooperation many never come again. But why  some say  the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask why climb the highest mountain? Why  35 years ago  fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas?  We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things  not because they are easy  but because they are hard  because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills  because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept  one we are unwilling to postpone  and one which we intend to win  and the others  too.  It is for these reasons that I regard the decision last year to shift our efforts in space from low to high gear as among the most important decisions that will be made during my incumbency in the office of the Presidency.  In the last 24 hours we have seen facilities now being created for the greatest and most complex exploration in man's history. We have felt the ground shake and the air shattered by the testing of a Saturn C-1 booster rocket  many times as powerful as the Atlas which launched John Glenn  generating power equivalent to 10 000 automobiles with their accelerators on the floor. We have seen the site where the F-1 rocket engines  each one as powerful as all eight engines of the Saturn combined  will be clustered together to make the advanced Saturn missile  assembled in a new building to be built at Cape Canaveral as tall as a 48 story structure  as wide as a city block  and as long as two lengths of this field.  Within these last 19 months at least 45 satellites have circled the earth. Some 40 of them were "made in the United States of America" and they were far more sophisticated and supplied far more knowledge to the people of the world than those of the Soviet Union.  The Mariner spacecraft now on its way to Venus is the most intricate instrument in the history of space science. The accuracy of that shot is comparable to firing a missile from Cape Canaveral and dropping it in this stadium between the the 40-yard lines.  Transit satellites are helping our ships at sea to steer a safer course. Tiros satellites have given us unprecedented warnings of hurricanes and storms  and will do the same for forest fires and icebergs.  We have had our failures  but so have others  even if they do not admit them. And they may be less public.  To be sure  we are behind  and will be behind for some time in manned flight. But we do not intend to stay behind  and in this decade  we shall make up and move ahead.  The growth of our science and education will be enriched by new knowledge of our universe and environment  by new techniques of learning and mapping and observation  by new tools and computers for industry  medicine  the home as well as the school. Technical institutions  such as Rice  will reap the harvest of these gains.  And finally  the space effort itself  while still in its infancy  has already created a great number of new companies  and tens of thousands of new jobs. Space and related industries are generating new demands in investment and skilled personnel  and this city and this State  and this region  will share greatly in this growth. What was once the furthest outpost on the old frontier of the West will be the furthest outpost on the new frontier of science and space. Houston  your City of Houston  with its Manned Spacecraft Center  will become the heart of a large scientific and engineering community. During the next 5 years the National Aeronautics and Space Administration expects to double the number of scientists and engineers in this area  to increase its outlays for salaries and expenses to $60 million a year; to invest some $200 million in plant and laboratory facilities; and to direct or contract for new space efforts over $1 billion from this Center in this City.  To be sure  all this costs us all a good deal of money. This year¹s space budget is three times what it was in January 1961  and it is greater than the space budget of the previous eight years combined. That budget now stands at $5 400 million a year--a staggering sum  though somewhat less than we pay for cigarettes and cigars every year. Space expenditures will soon rise some more  from 40 cents per person per week to more than 50 cents a week for every man  woman and child in the United Stated  for we have given this program a high national priority--even though I realize that this is in some measure an act of faith and vision  for we do not now know what benefits await us.  But if I were to say  my fellow citizens  that we shall send to the moon  240 000 miles away from the control station in Houston  a giant rocket more than 300 feet tall  the length of this football field  made of new metal alloys  some of which have not yet been invented  capable of standing heat and stresses several times more than have ever been experienced  fitted together with a precision better than the finest watch  carrying all the equipment needed for propulsion  guidance  control  communications  food and survival  on an untried mission  to an unknown celestial body  and then return it safely to earth  re-entering the atmosphere at speeds of over 25 000 miles per hour  causing heat about half that of the temperature of the sun--almost as hot as it is here today--and do all this  and do it right  and do it first before this decade is out--then we must be bold.  I'm the one who is doing all the work  so we just want you to stay cool for a minute. [laughter]  However  I think we're going to do it  and I think that we must pay what needs to be paid. I don't think we ought to waste any money  but I think we ought to do the job. And this will be done in the decade of the sixties. It may be done while some of you are still here at school at this college and university. It will be done during the term of office of some of the people who sit here on this platform. But it will be done. And it will be done before the end of this decade.  I am delighted that this university is playing a part in putting a man on the moon as part of a great national effort of the United States of America.  Many years ago the great British explorer George Mallory  who was to die on Mount Everest  was asked why did he want to climb it. He said  "Because it is there."  Well  space is there  and we're going to climb it  and the moon and the planets are there  and new hopes for knowledge and peace are there. And  therefore  as we set sail we ask God's blessing on the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure on which man has ever embarked.  Thank you.,LER,status

Fact: Today marks the 116th birthday of Bernard Lyot (1897-1952). Lyot is the inventor of the coronagraph. A coronagraph is an instrument which studies the sun's outer atmosphere  the corona.

Early Years at Marshall  Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) offers a great example of how the development of a NASA center created mini melting pots of cultures  from around the country and world   united in pursuing engineering and scientific challenges.     “Graduates of southern universities predominated among new employees in Huntsville  but people came from around the nation. Art Sanderson  who made recruiting trips as part of his responsibilities in the personnel office  recalled that ‘They wanted top-notch engineers and we had a charter to go all over this country to get them.’ [William] Snoddy  a die-hard Crimson Tide fan  said that the diverse origins of his fellow workers became most noticeable during football season. ‘It was really strange to be in Alabama and yet work around people that didn’t care ’ he laughed. ‘They had these weird teams they were cheering for. Some of them were even Yankee teams [from] places I’d never heard of like North Dakota.’” (NASA SP-4313 pp.17-18)  Read more about it at http://go.usa.gov/bwWA and search what Marshall is doing these days at http://go.usa.gov/bwZY.,LER,photo

JPL - The Early Years with NASA - Mariner 2  "With its position between Earth and the sun  it seemed natural that Venus would be a hotter place. Popular fiction frequently depicted Venus as a swamp world  where visiting astronauts might do battle with creatures roaming a hot  wet landscape. As late as 1954  Isaac Asimov penned a tale called Lucky Starr and the Oceans of Venus. The campy 1958 film Queen of Outer Space took another tack  imagining Zsa Zsa Gabor among the denizens of a planet of women."
