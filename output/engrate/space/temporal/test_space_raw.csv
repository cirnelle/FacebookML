In all the excitement of the launch of Tim Peake yesterday  we forgot to mention another milestone in space history: the first rendezvous in space happened 50 years ago on 15 December 1965. This was NASA's two-tiered Gemini 7/6A mission during which astronauts Walter Schirra and Tom Stafford of Gemini 6A linked with Frank Borman and Jim Lovell of Gemini 7. The spacecraft didn't actually dock but moved in tandem with each other for more than five hours as they circled Earth (pic: NASA) See http://spaceref.com/history/the-first-rendezvous-in-space---50-years-ago.html,HER,photo

Latest News: Hubble has captured an image of the first-ever predicted supernova explosion. The reappearance of the supernova dubbed "Refsdal" was calculated by different mass models of a galaxy cluster whose immense gravity is warping the supernova's light as the light travels toward Earth. The detection of Refsdal's reappearance served as a unique opportunity for astronomers to test their models of how mass — especially that of mysterious dark matter — is distributed within this galaxy cluster.﻿,HER,link

Latest News: Just about anything is possible in our remarkable universe  and it often competes with the imaginings of science fiction writers and filmmakers. Hubble's latest contribution is a striking photo of what looks like a double-bladed lightsaber straight out of the Star Wars films.   In the center of the image  partially obscured by a dark  Jedi-like cloak of dust  a newborn star shoots twin jets out into space as a sort of birth announcement to the universe. Gas from a surrounding disk rains down onto the dust-obscured protostar and engorges it. The material is superheated and shoots outward from the star in opposite directions along an uncluttered escape route — the star's rotation axis.   Much more energetic than a science fiction lightsaber  these narrow energetic beams are blasting across space at over 100 000 miles per hour. This celestial lightsaber does not lie in a galaxy far  far away but rather inside our home galaxy  the Milky Way.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2015/42/,HER,photo

NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) recently captured a unique view of Earth from the spacecraft's vantage point in orbit around the moon.  "The image is simply stunning " said Noah Petro  Deputy Project Scientist for LRO at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt  Maryland. "The image of the Earth evokes the famous 'Blue Marble' image taken by Astronaut Harrison Schmitt during Apollo 17  43 years ago  which also showed Africa prominently in the picture."  In this composite image we see Earth appear to rise over the lunar horizon from the viewpoint of the spacecraft  with the center of the Earth just off the coast of Liberia (at 4.04 degrees North  12.44 degrees West). The large tan area in the upper right is the Sahara Desert  and just beyond is Saudi Arabia. The Atlantic and Pacific coasts of South America are visible to the left. On the moon  we get a glimpse of the crater Compton  which is located just beyond the eastern limb of the moon  on the lunar farside.  LRO was launched on June 18  2009  and has collected a treasure trove of data with its seven powerful instruments  making an invaluable contribution to our knowledge about the moon. LRO experiences 12 earthrises every day; however the spacecraft is almost always busy imaging the lunar surface so only rarely does an opportunity arise such that its camera instrument can capture a view of Earth. Occasionally LRO points off into space to acquire observations of the extremely thin lunar atmosphere and perform instrument calibration measurements. During these movements sometimes Earth (and other planets) pass through the camera's field of view and dramatic images such as the one shown here are acquired.  This image was composed from a series of images taken Oct. 12  when LRO was about 83 miles (134 kilometers) above the moon's farside crater Compton. Capturing an image of the Earth and moon with LRO's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) instrument is a complicated task. First the spacecraft must be rolled to the side (in this case 67 degrees)  then the spacecraft slews with the direction of travel to maximize the width of the lunar horizon in LROC's Narrow Angle Camera image. All this takes place while LRO is traveling faster than 3 580 miles per hour (over 1 600 meters per second) relative to the lunar surface below the spacecraft!  The high-resolution Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) on LRO takes black-and-white images  while the lower resolution Wide Angle Camera (WAC) takes color images  so you might wonder how we got a high-resolution picture of the Earth in color. Since the spacecraft  Earth  and moon are all in motion  we had to do some special processing to create an image that represents the view of the Earth and moon at one particular time. The final Earth image contains both WAC and NAC information. WAC provides the color  and the NAC provides high-resolution detail.  "From the Earth  the daily moonrise and moonset are always inspiring moments " said Mark Robinson of Arizona State University in Tempe  principal investigator for LROC. "However  lunar astronauts will see something very different: viewed from the lunar surface  the Earth never rises or sets. Since the moon is tidally locked  Earth is always in the same spot above the horizon  varying only a small amount with the slight wobble of the moon. The Earth may not move across the 'sky'  but the view is not static. Future astronauts will see the continents rotate in and out of view and the ever-changing pattern of clouds will always catch one's eye  at least on the nearside. The Earth is never visible from the farside; imagine a sky with no Earth or moon - what will farside explorers think with no Earth overhead?"  NASA's first Earthrise image was taken with the Lunar Orbiter 1 spacecraft in 1966. Perhaps NASA's most iconic Earthrise photo was taken by the crew of the Apollo 8 mission as the spacecraft entered lunar orbit on Christmas Eve Dec. 24  1968. That evening  the astronauts -- Commander Frank Borman  Command Module Pilot Jim Lovell  and Lunar Module Pilot William Anders -- held a live broadcast from lunar orbit  in which they showed pictures of the Earth and moon as seen from their spacecraft. Said Lovell  "The vast loneliness is awe-inspiring and it makes you realize just what you have back there on Earth.",HER,photo

Been scanning through the 1000s of comments  and I have to say thank you very much to all. I can't answer everyone  but I noticed two of the most-often asked ones: why can't you see stars in my photos  and what will I eat for Christmas dinner? Very good questions!  1) The reason you can't see stars is the same as why you can't see any on Earth while standing under a street light for example. Earth is much brighter than the stars in the background. The stars are there if we look away from Earth but don't show up on photos because the camera cannot gather enough of their light in such a short exposure.  2) What's for Xmas dinner? I haven't decided yet  you'll have to wait and see!  Merry Christmas from space.,HER,status

Dear Lance   When I was a kid  you could take apart most things in the house with a screwdriver.  Inside  you’d see gears and pulleys and motors and occasionally a circuit board.  Back then  it was easy to take things apart.  But it was much harder to put things back together again.  Which meant that practically every home had a bin of discarded mechanical parts that you could play with --- and possibly invent something new.  Today  not so much.  But since you’ve already attempted to make an electric generator  clearly your basement is well-supplied.   Labs are fun places  but of course  they can also be dangerous -- especially if you’re exploring unfamiliar objects and ideas.  When you run out of supplies in your basement  this catalog: www.scientificsonline.com  and this one: www.hand2mind.com  and this one: www.fatbraintoys.com are loaded with sciencey stuff to play with  long into adulthood.  And anytime things get too dangerous  or if you just want to take a break from inventing stuff  yes  there’s always 13 episodes of Cosmos to watch.  In the meantime  here’s a short list of things the world needs invented.  Maybe you can get started on them right away:  a real hoverboard; a refrigerator door that dispenses soft ice cream instead of ice & water; warp drives; and of course...politicians who know science.  As always  keep looking up. -Neil deGrasse Tyson  New York City  P.S. My mother tells me that when I was born she almost named me “Lance”.,HER,photo

Rare Christmas Full Moon a Cosmic Gift for the Holidays: What to Expect  If you live anywhere east of the Mississippi River this year  you likely will not have snow on the ground on Christmas morning  but you will have a full moon. The moon will officially reach peak fullness at 6:11 a.m. EST (1111 GMT). A full moon coinciding with Christmas does not happen often — usually  once every 19 years. But this time  it is different  because a full moon on Christmas hasn't happened in nearly four decades. The last one was in 1977  and that's because of the vagaries of our calendar and a lunar cycle known for almost 2 500 years.  Image credit: P-M Heden  Read more: http://buff.ly/1Vfd2VD,HER,photo

Sunrise strikes our solar panels – makes a beautiful sight (…oh and also provides all of our power too!)  (ESA - the four sets of solar arrays can generate 84 to 120 kW of electricity -- enough power for around 40 homes. This is more power than the Station actually needs at one time for its systems and experiments  so when the Station is in sunlight  about 60% of the electricity generated is used to charge the Station's batteries. At times  some or all of the solar arrays are in shadow  meaning those arrays are not collecting sunlight. Then the batteries power the Station when it is not in the Sun.),HER,photo

Latest News: Astronomers have made the most detailed study yet of an extremely massive young galaxy cluster using three of NASA's Great Observatories. This multiwavelength image shows this galaxy cluster  called IDCS J1426.5+3508 (IDCS 1426 for short)  in X-rays recorded by the Chandra X-ray Observatory in blue  visible light observed by the Hubble Space Telescope in green  and infrared light from the Spitzer Space Telescope in red.  This rare galaxy cluster  which is located 10 billion light-years from Earth  is almost as massive as 500 trillion suns. This object has important implications for understanding how these megastructures formed and evolved early in the universe. Astronomers have observed IDCS 1426 when the universe was less than a third of its current age. It is the most massive galaxy cluster detected at such an early age.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2016/02/,HER,photo

On this day: 8 January 1942  Stephen Hawking was born. One of the greatest theoretical physicists and cosmologists of our time  he intended to study mathematics at University College Oxford  but since mathematics was not taught there at the time he studied physics instead. Hawking continued his studies at Cambridge University where he gained a PhD. He became Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in 1979  holding the same chair as Sir Isaac Newton had done in 1669.   Overcoming severe disability  Professor Hawking has made ground-breaking contributions to the study of the Universe and his many publications include The Large Scale Structure of Spacetime and 300 Years of Gravity  as well as his best seller A Brief History of Time and most recently his autobiography: My Own Brief History.  http://www.hawking.org.uk/index.html,HER,photo

David Bowie has died. It leaves me and  I suspect  millions around the world  with an instant feeling of loss and emptiness - and yet also a wistful joy  a sense of how creative and inspirational just one of us can be. His art defined an image of outer space  inner self  and a rapidly changing world for a generation finding themselves at the confluence.  I am honoured to have been able to return some of that favour. Being able to record Oddity (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaOC9danxNo) on the International Space Station was an attempt to bring that art full circle. It was meant as a way to allow people to experience  without it being stated  that our culture had reached beyond the planet. We live in space. I thank him for allowing us the opportunity  and for being so kind since.  These past two weeks I had watched and listened to David twice: once absorbing Lazarus (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-JqH1M4Ya8) from his new album  and once re-watching the recording he did of Little Drummer Boy with Bing Crosby (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kfdEyV3RQ). To me they are lovely  thoughtful moments  insights into in his relentless creativity. Bookends of intimacy spanning a life  both which make me want to watch them again and again. If you haven’t seen them  I recommend you take the time.  With much respect to a genius  a silent moment of reflection: ashes to ashes  dust to stardust. Your brilliance inspired us all. Goodbye Starman.,HER,status

APOD: 2016 January 12 - The California Nebula  What's California doing in space? Drifting through the Orion Arm of the spiral Milky Way Galaxy  this cosmic cloud by chance echoes the outline of California on the west coast of the United States. Our own Sun also lies within the Milky Way's Orion Arm  only about 1 500 light-years from the California Nebula. Also known as NGC 1499  the classic emission nebula is around 100 light-years long. On the featured image  the most prominent glow of the California Nebula is the red light characteristic of hydrogen atoms recombining with long lost electrons  stripped away (ionized) by energetic starlight. The star most likely providing the energetic starlight that ionizes much of the nebular gas is the bright  hot  bluish Xi Persei just to the right of the nebula. A regular target for astrophotographers  the California Nebula can be spotted with a wide-field telescope under a dark sky toward the constellation of Perseus  not far from the Pleiades.

What Will It Take for Humans to Colonize the Milky Way?  An interstellar voyage would present one set of extremely difficult problems  and the arrival in another system  a different set of problems. All the problems together create not an outright impossibility  but a project of extreme difficulty  with very poor chances of success. The unavoidable uncertainties suggest that an ethical pursuit of the project would require many preconditions before it was undertaken. Among them are these: first  a demonstrably sustainable human civilization on Earth itself  the achievement of which would teach us many of the things we would need to know to construct a viable mesocosm in an ark; second  a great deal of practice in an ark obiting our sun  where we could make repairs and study practices in an ongoing feedback loop  until we had in effect built a successful proof of concept; third  extensive robotic explorations of nearby planetary systems  to see if any are suitable candidates for inhabitation.

The spacewalk today ended successfully but early after water was detected in NASA astronaut Tim Kopra's helmet.  Kopra and ESA - European Space Agency astronaut Tim Peake completed the primary task for their spacewalk today before it was ended early by Mission Control Houston. The astronauts replaced a failed voltage regulator that caused a loss of power to one of the station’s eight power channels last November.  The pair ended its spacewalk at 12:31 p.m. EST with the repressurization of the U.S. Quest airlock following an early termination after Kopra reported a small water bubble had formed inside his helmet. The crew was never in any danger and returned to the airlock in an orderly fashion.

What Would Earth Look Like With Rings?  It is precisely this question that inspired Kevin Gill  a software engineer who performs science data visualizations for NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory  to create “Rings Over Earth”. Using vacation photos he has taken over the years  and then tweaking them with Photoshop and the 3-D animation/modeling software Maya  Gill was able to superimpose Saturn-like rings onto photographs of Earth’s skies.  In so doing  he was able to give viewers a realistic idea of what it would be like to look up at the skies and see a ring system similar to Saturn’s – specifically from the locations of New Hampshire  the San Bernadino Valley  the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles  or Pasadena  California. And as you can see from the photos  the end result is rather breathtaking and inspiring.  Image credit: Kevin Gill/Flickr  More images: http://buff.ly/1RVmKwr,HER,photo

Comets can't explain weird 'alien megastructure' star after all  Known as KIC 8462852  or Tabby’s star  it has been baffling astronomers for the past few months after a team of researchers noticed its light seemed to be dipping in brightness in bizarre ways. Proposed explanations ranged from a cloud of comets to orbiting “alien megastructures”.  Now Bradley Schaefer of Louisiana State University has discovered that the mystery goes even further. Schaefer decided this unusual star deserved a second look. To confirm the fade was real  Schaefer went to Harvard to look at the original photographic plates and inspected them by eye for changes  a skill few astronomers possess these days. He averaged the data in five-year bins to look for slow  long-term trends  and found that the star faded by about 20 per cent between 1890 and 1989. “The basic effect is small and not obvious ” he says.

Well  this is big news: Scientists may have found another MASSIVE planet in our solar system. (Credit: Science/AAAS),HER,video
Astronomers say a Neptune-sized planet lurks beyond Pluto  The solar system appears to have a new ninth planet. Today  two scientists announced evidence that a body nearly the size of Neptune—but as yet unseen—orbits the sun every 15 000 years. During the solar system’s infancy 4.5 billion years ago  they say  the giant planet was knocked out of the planet-forming region near the sun. Slowed down by gas  the planet settled into a distant elliptical orbit  where it still lurks today.  The claim is the strongest yet in the centuries-long search for a “Planet X” beyond Neptune. The quest has been plagued by far-fetched claims and even outright quackery. But the new evidence comes from a pair of respected planetary scientists  Konstantin Batygin and Mike Brown of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena  who prepared for the inevitable skepticism with detailed analyses of the orbits of other distant objects and months of computer simulations. “If you say  ‘We have evidence for Planet X ’ almost any astronomer will say  ‘This again? These guys are clearly crazy.’ I would  too ” Brown says. “Why is this different? This is different because this time we’re right.”  Read more: http://buff.ly/20eLQco,HER,link

Solid evidence for a 9th planet!  California Institute of Technology - Caltech announced today (January 20  2016) that its #astronomers now have solid theoretical evidence for a giant planet – a #9th major #planet in our solar system – moving in what they called a “bizarre  highly elongated orbit” in the outer solar system. They’ve nicknamed it Planet 9 and hope other astronomers will search for it.  If it exists  the 9th planet has 10 times the mass of Earth – orbits 20 times farther from the sun – and takes 20 000 years to orbit the sun once.

SETI Institute's own Jill Tarter pointed out a flaw in Stephen Hawking's fear of finding intelligent aliens  Many intellectual leaders of our age  including Stephen Hawking  say that the idea behind Active SETI should be avoided at all cost  but co-founder and former director of the SETI Institute Jill Tarter pointed out a serious flaw in Hawking's philosophy.  While Hawking fears that giving aliens our cosmic address could potentially bring death and ruin — much like what happened to many groups of Native Americans when Europeans invaded North America — Tarter thinks that aliens advanced enough to skip across star systems and reach Earth will be friendly  not aggressive.  "The idea of a civilization which has managed to survive far longer than we have ... and the fact that that technology remains an aggressive one  to me  doesn't make sense " Tarter told Business Insider. "The pressure of long-term survival — of limiting population ... I think requires that the evolutionary trends that ratcheted up our intelligence ... continues to evolve into something that's cooperative and take on global scale problems."

Latest News: Resembling an opulent diamond tapestry  this image from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope shows a glittering star cluster that contains a collection of some of the brightest stars seen in our Milky Way galaxy. Called Trumpler 14  it is located 8 000 light-years away in the Carina Nebula  a huge star-formation region. Because the cluster is only 500 000 years old  it has one of the highest concentrations of massive  luminous stars in the entire Milky Way. (The small  dark knot left of center is a nodule of gas laced with dust  and seen in silhouette.)  Diamonds are forever  but these blue-white stars are not. They are burning their hydrogen fuel so ferociously they will explode as supernovae in just a few million years. The combination of outflowing stellar "winds" and  ultimately  supernova blast waves will carve out cavities in nearby clouds of gas and dust. These fireworks will kick-start the beginning of a new generation of stars in an ongoing cycle of star birth and death.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2016/03/,HER,photo

When Will We Make Contact with Intelligent Aliens?   "I'm not holding my breath that we'll find conclusive evidence of alien technologies before the end of 2016. But the chances are getting better with every passing year " said Douglas Vakoch  Director of Interstellar Message Composition at the SETI Institute in Mountain View  California.  "Over the next decade  we should be able to search for radio signals from a million stars or more " he told Space dot com. "That's a big enough number to make it reasonable to think that we'll find intelligent life … if it's actually out there and trying to make contact."  So don't place your bets for winning the SETI lottery in 2016.  "But within the next decade  we may well discover we're not alone in the universe " Vakoch said.

Green colors in the northern lights result from the emission of light centered near the 558-nanometer portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Jacques-Cartier National Park lies within the Laurentian Mountains  one of the world's oldest mountain ranges  composed of Precambrian rocks that formed over 540 million years ago.

30 years ago  the Challenger space shuttle exploded shortly after launching. The seven crew members lost their lives.  The cause of explosion was determined to be an o-ring failure in the right solid rocket booster. Cold weather was determined to be a contributing factor.

Latest News: First discovered in the 1960s  the comet-shaped “Smith Cloud” -- depicted in this artist's illustration -- is 11 000 light-years long and 2 500 light-years across. The cloud  which is invisible at optical wavelengths  is plummeting toward our galaxy at nearly 700 000 miles per hour.   Astronomers long thought that the Smith Cloud might be a failed  starless galaxy  or gas falling into the Milky Way from intergalactic space. If either of these scenarios proved true  the cloud would contain mainly hydrogen and helium  not the heavier elements made by stars.  Hubble was used to measure the chemical composition and found heavier elements that could only come from stars. The cloud appears to have been ejected from within the Milky Way and is now boomeranging back. It will plow back into the Milky Way's disk in about 30 million years. When it does  astronomers believe it will ignite a spectacular burst of star formation  perhaps providing enough gas to make 2 million suns.   Though this settles the mystery of the Smith Cloud's origin  it raises new questions: How did the cloud get to where it is now? What calamitous event could have catapulted it from the Milky Way's disk  and how did it remain intact? The answers may be found in future research.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2016/04,HER,photo

What comes next will be the Aft Optics Subsystem  which goes at the center of the primary mirror - and the round secondary mirror  which goes at the end of the long booms you've seen on our Webbcam.  Once the telescope is assembled  the instruments (which are coming out a cryo test soon) will be integrated. Then there is extensive testing on the telescope both at Goddard and NASA Johnson. Meanwhile  our tennis court-sized sunshield is being constructed at Northrop Grumman. Once the telescope is through testing  it will go to Northrop Grumman to be mated with both the sunshield and the space craft bus. After more tests  the whole satellite will make its way to the launch site at French Guiana!,HER,photo

Good evening! Thanks for all your Likes  comments and questions  your interest is just fantastic. I'm going to answer a couple of the most commonly asked questions here each week. So let's start with these:  1) What time zone do we use in space?  The Station runs to UTC (Universal Time Coordinated)  which is basically GMT  luckily for ESA and those of you in UK :-) This time zone was chosen because it’s 'in the middle' of all the ISS partners (USA  Canada  ESA  Russia and Japan) and each of the two main mission control centres  Houston and Moscow  gets to cover half a day shift.  2) What time do we go to bed  and do we all sleep at the same time? Yes we sleep mostly all at the same time. We’re supposed to get about 8 hours of sleep per day  but this varies and we can go to bed anytime from 10 p.m. to midnight.,HER,status

Less than meets the eye? Saturn's rings surprise us again.   Details:  http://go.nasa.gov/1Srb8Dx,HER,photo
The Many Mysteries of Uranus  Uranus has been breaking the mold as long as we’ve known about it. Mercury  Venus  Mars  Jupiter  and Saturn are all easily visible to the naked eye; humans have been gazing at those planets for millennia  but Uranus was the first planet discovered by modern astronomy. It’s so far away  and its movement so slow  that it was originally thought to be a star until Sir William Herschel revealed its planetary nature in 1781. Less than a decade later  it received a namesake chemical element: uranium  discovered in 1789. (Meanwhile  Neptune and Pluto didn’t make it into the periodic table for another 150 years.)  The more astronomers studied this new planet  the clearer it became that it was an odd one. Consider the seasons on a world turned sideways: Summer on Uranus is two decades of non-stop sunlight  and winter is an equal amount of time spent in total darkness  facing the cold void of distant space. Day and night only exist during spring and fall  where they cycle every 17 hours. Some have suggested that the planet was knocked askew by a gravitational tug-of-war with a large moon that has since been lost; others have proposed that it was the result of a collision with a massive object (much larger than Earth)  or even multiple collisions.

A Cataclysmic Collision Formed the Moon  but Killed Theia  New evidence from a team at UCLA is clarifying the story of the Moon’s origins. According to this research  the Moon was formed as a result of a massive collision between Earth and a “planet embryo” about the size of Mars called Theia. This collision happened about 100 million years after the Earth was formed. Published on January 29th in the journal Science  this new geological evidence strengthens the case for the collision model.  The researchers compared Earth rocks with rocks retrieved from the Moon over the years. (Over 380kg of rocks have been brought back to Earth.) They found that these samples—collected on Apollo missions 12  15  and 17—had the same chemical composition as seven rocks collected from Earth’s mantle  in Hawaii and Arizona. The key to the comparison lies in the nature of the oxygen atoms in the rocks.  Oxygen is a highly reactive element. It is easily combined with other elements  and is the most common element in the Earth’s crust. There are several different oxygen isotopes present in the Earth’s crust  and on other bodies in the solar system. The amount of each isotope present on each body is the “fingerprint” that makes the formation of each body different.  But the team at UCLA has shown that Earth and the Moon share the same cocktail of oxygen isotopes. They have the same fingerprint. This means that somehow  someway  their formation is linked.

How Planet 9 Would Make Ours a More Typical Solar System  The validity of the discovery of a Planet 9 has set off hot debates — with NASA officials  for instance  making clear that the agency sees the “discovery” as an exciting but early step towards establishing the existence of possible new planet.  We all are drawn to controversy and discovery  so the presence  or non-presence  of the planet has been the focus of attention.  But another most intriguing aspect of the finding has not gotten much attention.  And that is the fact that a planet like this “9” would make our solar system surprisingly more similar to the untold far more eccentric exoplanet solar systems now known to be out there.  Our solar system would also suddenly have a population of planets sized more like the galactic norm.  What’s more  there’s reason to consider that a Planet 9 is more likely to have been spun off another solar system than having been ejected from the inner solar system  as proposed by Brown and colleague Konstantin Batygin.  In other words  Planet 9 may be an exoplanet in origin  and it may solve some questions about why our solar system seems to be so different than most other exoplanetary systems discovered so far.

Hello! Just got time to do a couple more commonly asked questions.  1) How do we wash our clothes in space?  2) What happens to waste from the Space Station? We don’t have a washing machine so we wear the same clothes  including underwear  for several days before we change. It’s not as bad as it sounds. We live in temperature-controlled environment  so clothes don’t get as dirty as they might on Earth. Some of the items  like socks or our exercise gear  have anti-bacterial materials in them. We change our exercise kit every 3-4 days. We change underwear every two days. Then we have polo shirts  T-shirts  trousers and shorts that last a couple of weeks. Our used/dirty clothes are placed in a waste bag and put on a Progress supply spacecraft that undocks and then burns up in Earth’s atmosphere. This is also how we get rid of other rubbish  such as empty food packaging or our solid waste from the toilet  for example. That's it for now  have a good evening!,HER,status

APOD: 2016 February 8 - Light Pillars over Alaska  What's happening behind those houses? Pictured here are not auroras but nearby light pillars  a nearby phenomenon that can appear as a distant one. In most places on Earth  a lucky viewer can see a Sun-pillar  a column of light appearing to extend up from the Sun caused by flat fluttering ice-crystals reflecting sunlight from the upper atmosphere. Usually these ice crystals evaporate before reaching the ground. During freezing temperatures  however  flat fluttering ice crystals may form near the ground in a form of light snow  sometimes known as a crystal fog. These ice crystals may then reflect ground lights in columns not unlike a Sun-pillar. The featured image was taken in Fort Wainwright near Fairbanks in central Alaska.

Hundreds of Hidden Galaxies Glimpsed Behind Milky Way  Scientists used an Australian radio telescope famous for assisting with the moon landings to peer through the gas and dust of the Milky Way  and uncovered 883 galaxies hidden behind it — one-third of which were never observed before.   The new observations  made using the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) Parkes Observatory  in Australia  found three new galaxy concentrations (NW1  NW2 and NW3) and two new clusters (CW1 and CW2). The researchers put a new  21-centimeter (8.3 inches) multibeam receiver on the observatory that allowed it to map the sky 13 times faster than it had previously  officials said in the statement. Thus  they were able to pin down a region beyond the Milky Way that astronomers had wondered about for decades.   Watch here: http://buff.ly/1KDWFB6,HER,link

What are gravitational waves and what would their discovery mean?  Watch the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory’s press conference today at 10:30 a.m. (EST) to get an update about their research on the subject: https://www.youtube.com/user/VideosatNSF/live.  Photo: NASA.,HER,link
It's official: Researchers have directly detected gravitational waves. #LIGO #gravitationalwaves,HER,link
100 years after Albert Einstein predicted their existence in his Theory of Relativity  gravitational waves  the ripples in space-time caused by massive objects moving through space  have been detected. Gravitational waves will allow us to observe the universe in a new way and tell us more about its beginnings. Incidentally  the National Science Foundation (NSF)’s LIGO lab detected the waves using laser interferometry  the same technology that will be used by NASA’s GRACE-FO mission to continue monitoring Earth’s gravity and mass changes.

Albert Einstein predicted the existence of gravitational waves a century ago. Now  the detection of these waves has been announced. Scientists are interested in observing and characterizing gravitational waves to learn more about the sources producing them and about gravity itself.

When two black holes collide  they release massive amounts of energy in the form of gravitational waves that last a fraction of a second and can be "heard" throughout the universe - if you have the right instruments.   Today we learned that the #LIGO project heard the telltale chirp of black holes colliding  fulfilling Einstein's General Theory of Relativity.   NASA's LISA mission will look for direct evidence of gravitational waves. http://go.nasa.gov/23ZbqoE  This video illustrates what that collision might look like.,HER,video
One of Einstein's radical predictions about gravity is true — gravitational waves exist!,HER,link
Gravitational Waves Discovered from Colliding Black Holes  About 1.3 billion years ago two black holes swirled closer and closer together until they crashed in a furious bang. Each black hole packed roughly 30 times the mass of our sun into a minute volume  and their head-on impact came as the two were approaching the speed of light. The staggering strength of the merger gave rise to a new black hole and created a gravitational field so strong that it distorted spacetime in waves that spread throughout space with a power about 50 times stronger than that of all the shining stars and galaxies in the observable universe. Such events are  incredibly  thought to be common in space  but this collision was the first of its kind ever detected and its waves the first ever seen. Scientists with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) announced on Thursday at a much-anticipated press conference in Washington  D.C. (one of at least five simultaneous events held in the U.S. and Europe) that the more than half-century search for gravitational waves has finally succeeded.

APOD: 2016 February 11 - LIGO Detects Gravitational Waves from Merging Black Holes  Gravitational radiation has been directly detected. The first-ever detection was made by both facilities of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) in Washington and Louisiana simultaneously last September. After numerous consistency checks  the resulting 5-sigma discovery was published today. The measured gravitational waves match those expected from two large black holes merging after a death spiral in a distant galaxy  with the resulting new black hole momentarily vibrating in a rapid ringdown. A phenomenon predicted by Einstein  the historic discovery confirms a cornerstone of humanity's understanding of gravity and basic physics. It is also the most direct detection of black holes ever. The featured illustration depicts the two merging black holes with the signal strength of the two detectors over 0.3 seconds superimposed across the bottom. Expected future detections by Advanced LIGO and other gravitational wave detectors may not only confirm the spectacular nature of this measurement but hold tremendous promise of giving humanity a new way to see and explore our universe.

Docked close to our Soyuz  the Cygnus spacecraft with its 'umbrella' solar array will depart the International Space Station soon.  An interesting pic for a few reasons:   1. Some people have been asking about the ‘umbrella’ outside the Cupola window. This shows that it’s not an umbrella but in fact the Cygnus solar panels.  2. The robotic arm grappled Cygnus yesterday in preparation for it’s departure next week. The vehicle has been unloaded and the crew are busy filling it with trash to burn up on reentry.  3. The photo shows the close proximity of our Soyuz spacecraft to Cygnus… which is why Yuri’s steady hand during manual docking was so important.,HER,photo

Just time for a couple more commonly asked questions. 1) How many times will we go around Earth during our flight? 2) How far will we travel in that time? This time though  I'm going to give you the chance to work these out for yourselves. First  you need to know how long we'll be in space. Let's say 170 days. You know that we have 16 orbits a day. So that's 170 x 16 = ? orbits. Next  how far. You know that we travel at 28000 km per hour. So you need to work out how many hours there are in 170 days. The distance will be 170 x 24 x 28000 = ? km.  Have a go!,HER,status

Latest News: After years of preparatory studies  NASA is formally starting an astrophysics mission designed to help unlock the secrets of the universe — the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST).  With a view 100 times bigger than that of NASA's Hubble Space Telescope  WFIRST will aid researchers in their efforts to unravel the secrets of dark energy and dark matter  and explore the evolution of the cosmos. It will also discover new worlds outside our solar system and advance the search for worlds that could be suitable for life.  NASA's Agency Program Management Council  which evaluates the agency's programs and projects on content  risk management  and performance  made the decision to move forward with the mission on Wednesday.  "WFIRST has the potential to open our eyes to the wonders of the universe  much the same way Hubble has " said John Grunsfeld  astronaut and associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington  D.C. "This mission uniquely combines the ability to discover and characterize planets beyond our own solar system with the sensitivity and optics to look wide and deep into the universe in a quest to unravel the mysteries of dark energy and dark matter."  WFIRST is the agency's next major astrophysics observatory  following the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope in 2018. The observatory will survey large regions of the sky in near-infrared light to answer fundamental questions about the structure and evolution of the universe  and expand our knowledge of planets beyond our solar system — known as exoplanets.  "As a general-purpose observatory  astronomers will use WFIRST to create panoramic views of the universe " said Jason Kalirai of the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore  Maryland  who is one of the members of the WFIRST Formulation Science Working Group (FSWG). "These new windows on our solar system  the Milky Way galaxy  and the distant universe will yield fundamental progress in many astrophysical topics."  WFIRST will carry a wide-field instrument for surveys  and a coronagraph instrument designed to block the glare of individual stars and reveal the faint light of planets orbiting around them. By blocking the light of the host star  the coronagraph instrument will enable detailed measurements of the chemical makeup of planetary atmospheres. Comparing these data across many worlds will allow scientists to better understand the origin and physics of these atmospheres  and search for chemical signs of environments suitable for life.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2016/06/  Watch the Hubble Hangout on WFIRST today at 3 p.m.: http://hbbl.us/y6I,HER,video
Latest News: Hubble Space Telescope astronomers have been able to pick up the faint infrared glow of a giant planet located 170 light-years away from Earth. Not only is it glowing  but also rhythmically flickering as the planet -- shown in this artist's interpretation -- spins on its axis like a top. The interpretation is that the subtle changes in the planet's brightness are due to a variegated cloud cover of comparatively bright and dark patches coming and going. These measurements have led to an estimate of how fast the planet is spinning through direct observation — a first for exoplanet astronomers. The gaseous world completes one rotation approximately every 10 hours  which  coincidentally  is the same rotation rate as Jupiter.  http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2016/05/,HER,photo

On 20 February 1986  the construction of Mir  Russia's next-generation space station  began with the launch of the core module on a Proton-K 337-01 rocket. During the 15 years that Mir was in operation  13 European astronauts visited the station. When Mir was finally de-orbited by a specially modified Progress tug in 2001  it had been operational for three times its planned lifetime  it consisted of seven modules with 11.5 tonnes of scientific equipment on board  and had provided astronauts from many nations with experience in extended spaceflight.

Time for some more commonly asked questions:  1) Can I see stars and planets  and do they look different?  2) Why are there no stars in my pics of Earth or my spacewalk?  Yes  we can see stars and planets. We still see some twinkling of stars because of the vast amount of gas/dust in the Universe that starlight passes through. However  our atmosphere causes most of that ‘twinkling’ and makes the stars appear slightly less clear than when viewed from space. That's why you find many of the world’s observatories on mountains tops – it’s an attempt to reduce the amount of atmosphere that starlight has to travel through (and mountains tend to have less light pollution!). Of course  we have no atmosphere outside our window  so it seems to me that the planets appear to be slightly brighter when viewed from up here – certainly Jupiter  Mars and Venus. What’s also interesting is trying to judge distance. When Cygnus departed on Friday  we had the most spectacular view of it disappearing ahead of the Space Station and of course it got smaller as it got further away but it still looked very sharp and clear even at a distance  because there were no atmospheric obscurants in between. This made it harder to judge how far away it was.  Next  the reason why you can’t see stars in my daytime pics of Earth or my spacewalk is that  when lit by the Sun  any foreground objects  such as Earth  the ISS or my spacesuit  are many thousands of times brighter than the stars in the background. Earth is so bright that it swamps out most if not all of the stars. The stars don’t show up because the camera cannot gather enough of their light in a short exposure. Our eyes are a lot more sensitive to light than the cameras. To take pictures of stars  we need longer exposures on night-time parts of our orbit.,HER,status

Three Times the Fun  Three of Saturn's moons -- Tethys  Enceladus  and Mimas -- are captured in this group photo from NASA's Cassini spacecraft. Tethys (660 miles or 1062 kilometers across) appears above the rings  while Enceladus (313 miles or 504 kilometers across) sits just below center. Mimas (246 miles or 396 kilometers across) hangs below and to the left of Enceladus.  This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 0.4 degrees above the ring plane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Dec. 3  2015.  The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 837 000 miles (1.35 million kilometers) from Enceladus  with an image scale of 5 miles (8 kilometers) per pixel. Tethys was approximately 1.2 million miles (1.9 million kilometers) away with an image scale of 7 miles (11 kilometers) per pixel.

Morning all! Just time for a few more frequently asked questions! 1) What is your daily routine when there are 16 sunrises/sunsets every day? 2) Do you have time off? If so  how do you spend your spare time?  First  we synchronise our body clocks according to a working day like you might have on Earth. We wake up around 6 or 7 a.m.  get a wash  have breakfast and check the schedule for our day. Work can go from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.  and sometimes later. I usually eat meals with Scott and Tim during the week  and we join our Russian colleagues and socialise as a full crew typically on Friday and Saturday evenings. I usually check our orbital path each morning for the 16 laps around Earth that we travel each day  so that I can set my alarm for when we’re overhead places of interest that I might want to photograph. The Space Station time zone is GMT  although sometimes we have to shift our sleep when a Soyuz crew arrive or depart so we can support the launch or landing in Kazakhstan.   Second  in the week there’s not much free time. We have a couple of hours in the evenings after dinner but this is  mostly spent catching up on emails.

Ever wondered what happens inside the International Space Station during a reboost? I filmed inside during last week's firing of the Progress thrusters.  Even at 400 km  there are still enough molecules of the atmosphere to create some 'atmospheric drag'  which causes the Station to drop by about 2 km a month. Because of this we need to raise the Station's orbit every so often. On 17 February the engines of the Progress M-29M spacecraft that is docked to the aft port of the Zvezda module were fired for 11 minutes.   The burn primarily focused on raising the Station’s perigee  making the orbit more circular.  Pre-reboost:  398.2 x 407.4 km - Inclination: 51.64° - Period: 92.62min Post-reboost: 402.1 x 406.9 km - Inclination: 51.64° - Period: 92.66min,HER,video
Astrophoto: A Brain-Melting Star-Forming Factory   The Tarantula is a gigantic gas cloud located in the Large Magellanic Cloud  a small satellite galaxy to the Milky Way  and one of the closest galaxies in the Universe to us  roughly 160 000 light-years away. That makes it an ideal target to study—close enough that we can get an overall picture of its structure  and still get very highly detailed images of it as well.  The Tarantula is one of the largest known star-forming nebula for millions of light-years around us and sitting right there close by for us to examine. Everything about it is ridiculous. It’s 600 light-years across  vast by any account—the Orion Nebula  a big cloud in our galaxy  is “only” 25 light-years across. Orion is visible faintly to the naked eye at a distance of 1 400 light-years; if the Tarantula were that close  you wouldn’t be able to cover it up with your outstretched hand  and it would be so bright it would cast shadows!

The NASA-improved X-ray fluorescence (XRF) scanners have been particularly well received in museums  where they are used to authenticate artifacts and works of art and assist those who conserve them. The scanner’s ability to detect the elemental composition of an object with a simple  nondestructive scan makes it ideal for analyzing precious  rare  or delicate items. Kaiser estimates that more than 600 museums and universities worldwide now use the device  including such institutions as the National Archives  the Field Museum of Natural History  the Louvre  the National Gallery  and the British Museum.   One reason the device is so popular is that experts in art history or archeology can easily be taught how to use it. “It doesn’t take a chemist to operate it ” says Bruce Kaiser  a scientist and pioneer in XRF technology  “I can teach anyone how to point the scanner  look at the color pattern  and figure out what they’ve got.”   As a practical example of the technology’s impact  Kaiser cites art authentication: “I can make something look yellow  but there are a hundred different ways to make something look yellow. Van Gogh only used one. If a museum is eyeing a newly discovered painting  it might be beautiful  it might have the right style and details  but if the elements in the pigments don’t match what Van Gogh used  then you know it’s not his. And yet the museum was about to spend $2 million on it.”   Read more: http://go.usa.gov/jxad And even more: http://go.usa.gov/jxaF,LER,photo

Public opinion polls show that Americans believe that NASA takes up about 20% of the national budget. However  the overall annual NASA budget is only about 0.5% of U.S. Government spending. That's half a penny of every tax dollar. By comparison  in 2012  the government spent the same amount of money on Farm Subsidies (0.4%) and Agricultural Research (0.1%) as it did on NASA. And these numbers pale in comparison to the real big ticket items -- Defense (24.8%) Social Security (22%)  and Healthcare (22.7%).,LER,link

Let's Ride!  Cowboy Joe (NACA High-Speed Flight Station test pilot Joseph Walker) and his steed (Bell Aircraft Corporation X-1A) A happy Joe was photographed in 1955 at Edwards  California. The X-1A was flown six times by Bell Aircraft Company pilot Jean "Skip" Ziegler in 1953. Air Force test pilots Maj. Charles "Chuck" Yeager and Maj. Arthur "Kit" Murray made 18 flights between 21 November 1953 and 26 August 1954. The X-1A was then turned over to the NACA. Joe Walker piloted the first NACA flight on 20 July 1955. Walker attemped a second flight on 8 August 1955  but an explosion damaged the aircraft just before launch. Walker  unhurt  climbeed back into the JTB-29A mothership  and the X-1A was jettisoned over the Edwards AFB bombing range.  See: http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=E-1758,LER,photo

Back in the 60s and 70s  Apollo astronauts circling the moon saw something that still puzzles researchers today. About 10 seconds before lunar sunrise or lunar sunset  pale luminous streamers would pop up over the gray horizon. These "twilight rays" were witnessed by crewmembers of Apollo 8  10  15  and 17.  Later this week a NASA spacecraft is going back to the moon to investigate. Slated for launch on Sept 6  2013  the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer ("LADEE" for short) will seek out twilight rays and other mysteries of the lunar atmosphere.
