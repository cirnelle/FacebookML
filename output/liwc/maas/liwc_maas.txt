Say hello to Studio Pop-ups  where you can get up close and personal with designers and their creative process! Thursday 15 to Sunday 18 August  10am to 5pm Tickets: free with Museum entry   Everybody knows about the Powerhouse Museum’s Young Blood markets which were launched in 2005 as part of Sydney Design. It was one of the first designer markets in Sydney and the only design market which was presented in a vibrant museum setting. Markets are an important launch pad for emerging designers but as a museum dedicated to ‘unpacking’ design in all its manifestations  we now feel its time to crank it up a notch and give you the chance to see inside a designer’s studio.   Studio Pop-ups will continue to support the work of local designers whilst offering you a deeper and more meaningful experience with the design process. Discover how a jeweller makes each piece  learn about contemporary technologies  processes  systems and equipment and find out first hand what motivates and inspires designers or hear about changes in their field.   Studio Pop-ups presents ten carefully selected design studios – as pop ups. Designers are selling their products and also offering you the chance to see how it’s done. Each studio is housed in a specially-designed pop up stall located inside the Museum. Studio Pop-ups is the perfect opportunity to be a part of the design conversation and to learn more about the design process. Where else can you buy your favourite designer’s work  have a go at the creative process yourself and go home with a deeper knowledge and understanding of how it was made?  http://www.sydneydesign.com.au/2013/event/studio-pop-ups-3/	LER	link	90.12	80.98	28.23	82.36	23.75	22.81	3.16	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	3.86	4.21	0.00	1.05	1.05	1.05	0.70	0.70	0.70	1.05	2.81	1.40	1.05	0.35	0.00	0.35	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.35	0.35

We are still getting lots of calls about Mars being as big as the full Moon tomorrow  27 August. Nope! It cannot happen but the hoax that began in 2003 when Mars was close seems come back to us every year. If you get up early tomorrow morning and look East you may see the faint planet Mars in the constellation of Cancer the Crab at around 5:30am AEDT. Rather than being the same size as the Moon it will appear to be just 1/460th as big  ie tiny. As Dr Nick explains in his detailed blog it will be good in 2018 but never as big as the Moon. Enjoy the view if you do decide to get up and check.

On the day I was born the Sun was in the constellation of Leo but according to my "star sign" I am a Virgo! Either way I love looking at the sky and right now (Mon 12 Aug 2013 8:20PM AEST) the Moon is very close to the brightest star in Virgo called Spica. If there are any other wonderful Virgos out there have a look at the best of all the Zodiacs (flame proof suit at the ready). Of course at Sydney Observatory we don't believe in astrology but we do use the stars as a map. Right now the celestial map has the Moon in Virgo. Watch how much is moves before it sets.

Probably no Perseids for us :( We've had a lot of calls about the meteor shower coming from the constellation of Perseus. As you can see in the image made with Stellarium the constellation is on the northern horizon at around 4:30am for us in Sydney. Sadly that is too low. There may be one or two bright meteors or even fireballs but it is very unlikely. On any clear night you can expect to see up to 6 meteors per hour every night but from a bright city they are lost in the light pollution. The Perseid meteor shower is a northern hemisphere event. Please check www.spaceweather.com for updates and images.

As Dr Nick mentions in his Daily Cosmobite  tonight is a great chance to pop outside NOW and see the setting Moon near Venus. You can see all of the Moon because of a phenomenon known as Earthshine. Some sunlight bounces off the Earth and softly illuminates the Moon. It's beautiful.

Speared emu? Last night from Mitchell Ridge Lookout at around 6:22pm AEST a satellite made an interesting addition to a twilight image. After the end of nautical twilight (6:13pm) but before the end of astronomical twilight (6:43pm) the sky was still blue to the camera.  A short exposure (20sec ISO 3200 Canon 6D Samyang 14mm @f2.8) showed the emu in the sky while the satellite traced out what could be interpreted as a spear!

Zodiacal light seen from Mitchell Ridge Lookout at Mt Victoria. Looking west not long after sunset on Saturday 3 Aug 2013. The triple glow on the horizon is from Lithgow on the right  Bathurst in the middle and Oberon on the left (best guess). Venus is the brightest object towards the centre. Almost hidden in the light from the three towns is a column of light that can be seen rising from the west above Bathurst and engulfing Venus. This light is called the Zodiacal light and is sunlight scattered off dust in the plane of the Solar System. Image by Geoff of the Obs.

Tanabata on 7th July each year is my (Geoff of the Obs) favourite star festival. It deals with the stars Altair and the former pole star Vega. Legend in Japan has it that Vega (Orihime) misses her husband Altair (Hikoboshi) who has been marooned on the other side of the Milky Way  the river in the sky  by her father. Once a year magpies build a bridge over the Milky Way so the two can be together for just one day. A sad but lovely story. Both stars are visible now on this cold winter night. Vega is very low in the north and the fifth brightest star in the night sky. Altair is about 40 degrees above the northwest horizon at 11pm. It is the twelfth brightest star in the night sky. From the countryside you should be able to see the Milky Way between them. The woodblock print showing the festival was copied from Wikipedia.

On 23 June 2013  our nearest neighbour  the Moon  will be particularly close. As the Moon orbits the Earth in a slightly elliptical orbit  the closest monthly approach known as perigee will be 356 991km at 21:12 AEST. At nearly the same time  the Moon will be full at 21:32 AEST.   Recently  this potentially pretty combination of a full moon near the same time as perigee has been dubbed the “Supermoon”.  Weather permitting  this seems like a good time not only to enjoy the view but to test an odd idea about the size of the Moon as we see it.  Have you ever noticed that Moon looks so much larger when it rises than when it appears high overhead? The Moon  the Sun and even the constellations suffer from the same magnification near the horizon  or do they?  Here in Sydney  the full moon rises at 16:50 AEST at a compass bearing of 101 degrees  or about 114 degrees East of true North. This is 4 hours and 42 minutes before it is full and 4 hours and 22 minutes before its closest approach.  There is no doubt it will be the biggest full moon of the year but is it really bigger when it is close to the horizon than when it is high overhead?  So here is your challenge. Find a stiff piece of clear plastic (or cardboard if that’s all you can find) and have a marker pen ready. You will also need a clear view to the East to see the Moon rise. Just as the Moon clears the horizon  hold the piece of plastic at arm's length and mark off the Moon’s apparent diameter. Enjoy the view before retreating back inside where it’s warm and perhaps read one of our other blog posts. Go back outside 3 to 6 hours later  if you can stay up that late  and repeat the measurements. Make sure you record which set of marks was taken at what time  and include the date.  Now measure with a ruler the two sets of marks and compare.  Did the Moon actually get smaller as it rose  or did it get bigger or stay the same within the limitations of our simple exercise?  On 24 June we will post a call for your answers on our Facebook page - just reply with your answer  'SMALLER'  'BIGGER' or 'SAME'.  Most importantly  don’t throw out the piece of plastic as we will use it again for the 'Minimoon' on 16 January 2014 when the full moon occurs near apogee at about 403 532km away.  Good luck.

"I will be talking at the Sydney City Skywatchers meeting tomorrow evening (6.30pm at Sydney Observatory) about my PhD research  including impressions & photographs of my recent experience travelling to and camping at one of the most remote places on the planet - Ridge A  Antarctica - to service a robotic astronomical observatory.  Ridge A is the driest place on Earth  making it the ideal site for far-infrared (terahertz) astronomy. It is also one of the coldest places on Earth: thankfully we visited in the peak of summer  where temperatures were a balmy -45 C.  Bookings are not required and it is open to members and everyone who is passionate about astronomy. Talks are followed by supper ($2 donation)."

Sadly not comets! At this time of year we get a few calls about odd comet-like objects very early of a morning or just after sunset. In most cases what people are seeing are high altitude jets leaving behind a vapour trail or contrail. They are in effect just clouds. Hot moist air from the engines condenses if the weather conditions are just right. Seen from a great distance and reflecting the sun from over the horizon they can look like a golden comet. Well worth a look if you are up early looking east or just after sunset looking west. Good luck.

So what's next? Perhaps the oldest of all the traditional constellations  Taurus the Bull will host three planets jockeying for position over several days at the end of this month. From 25 to 30 May  Jupiter  Venus and Mercury will be close together and close to the western horizon making them hard to see but worth a try. You will need to have a clear  preferably high  westward view. Venus and Jupiter will be bright but Mercury is nearly always hard to see. Depending on the conditions the best time to see them is around 20 to 30 minutes after sunset. Good luck.

In response to questions on how to view the upcoming eclipse without solar glasses the following was copied from an earlier post by Dr Nick Lomb  curator of astronomy at Sydney Observatory.  Do not look at the Sun either directly or through a telescope or binoculars. To do so risks serious eye damage or blindness.  However it is possible to safely watch the eclipse if you have a small telescope or a pair of binoculars – but to look at a projection of the Sun instead of looking through the instrument at the Sun.   Use the telescope (for safety  remove the finderscope first) or the binoculars to project the image  as shown in the diagram. With your back to the Sun  aim the telescope towards it (this is not as difficult to do as it sounds – use the shadow of the telescope) and focus its image onto a white card held about 20 cm behind the eyepiece.   DO NOT LOOK THROUGH THE TELESCOPE OR ITS LITTLE FINDERSCOPE! Never leave the telescope unattended and ensure that children are supervised at all times. Viewing the projected image is quite safe  but looking through the telescope or binoculars will cause almost instant blindness!

Sydney Observatory's Artist in residence program has had two major creative outcomes this year. A painting by Jeannette Landstedt featuring Sydney Observatory as an icon of Sydney Harbour was selected to be hung at Campbelltown Art Gallery's prestigious Fisher Ghost Award exhibition (until 16 December) and Lisa Samutt's work brings art and science together in an exhibition at the Accelerator Gallery  Pyrmont (until 21 December). Jeanette Landstedt's work draws on concepts of mapping the land and sky  past and present  while Lisa Samutt's work is themed around stellar magnitude. Christie McMonigal  Astronomy Educator at Sydney Observatory  was the main contact for Lisa at Sydney Observatory and she spoke about light and astronomy at the opening event.

This cluster is visible to the naked eye but it is very spectacular through binoculars or a small telescope.

Look to the west this evening after sunset and you will see Venus and the Moon  close together in the sky. The Moon will only be a very thin crescent whereas Venus will be a very bright point of light. They will both then set together in the west at around 10:30pm. You will also notice that Venus is very bright. Venus is at maximum brightness tonight. There are two main factors affecting the brightness of Venus - one is how close Venus is to the Earth and the other is the relative position of Venus to the Sun as viewed from Earth. The combination of these two factors has resulted in the brightness of Venus increasing over the past few weeks to a maximum brightness tonight  after tonight it will slowly start to fade back to usual levels.

Look almost due north this evening at around 10pm and you will see the Constellation of Andromeda. This constellation is home to our nearest spiral galaxy  and largest galaxy in the Local Group (the group of nearby galaxies including the Milky Way)  The Andromeda Galaxy. This galaxy is also referred to as Messier 31 or M31. The Andromeda Galaxy is about 2.5 million light years away and is estimated to contain at least twice as many stars as our own Milky Way.  On a clear night with no moon and away from the city lights the Andromeda Galaxy can been seen with the naked eye  but if you can't get somewhere dark enough you should be able to see it with a pair of binoculars.

If you look towards the east tonight  you will see the bright star Sirius  in the constellation of Canis Major rising. Sirius  also known as the Dog Star  is the brightest star in the night's sky. To our naked eye  Sirius looks like one star  but it is in fact two stars  called a binary system. The brighter of these is a main sequence star much more luminous than the Sun  the fainter one is a white dwarf. This system is about 8.6 light years away.

If you are out tonight and away from the city lights (and cloud)  look to the south-east this evening  you will see the bright star Canopus low in the sky. If you look up from Canopus  you might be lucky enough to be able to make out the Magellanic Clouds. These are two dwarf galaxies orbiting our own Milky Way. From the Earth they appear as if two parts of the Milky Way have broken off and are sitting by themselves in the sky. The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is the bigger of the two and is about 160 000 light years away and about 14 000 light years across. The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) is about 200 000 light years away and only 7 000 light years across.

Look towards the rising Moon in the east this evening  below the Moon and to the north  in the constellation of Taurus  you will see a star cluster that is visible to the naked eye. This cluster is commonly known as the Pleiades or Seven Sisters. The Pleiades is dominated by hot  young  very bright blue stars and is one of the closest clusters to the Earth. For these reasons it is one of the brightest star clusters when viewed from the Earth and has been known since ancient times by cultures around the world. For example  in Japan  this cluster is called Subaru  and an image of the cluster is the logo for the car company of the same name.

The full moon is at 10:38am EADT on the 19th October. The time of the full moon refers to the point when the moon is exactly opposite the Sun relative to the Earth. Because this occurs during the day in Sydney  the exact moment of the full moon will not be visible from Sydney. However  the moon will appear almost full tonight. Look to the east  as the Sun is setting  you will see the Moon rise in the constellation of Pisces.

The Sun is looking very red today with all the smoke around. The light from the blue end of the spectrum is scattered away while the red light is able to travel straight through the smoke  and so the sun appears red.

If you are up tonight at around midnight  head outside and look to the east. Rising in the east you will see the constellation of Orion. Orion is often called the hunter  he is upside down when viewed from the Southern Hemisphere. The belt of Orion is very easy to find  it is three very bright stars in a line. Coming off the belt are three points of light which form a sword  the middle point of these is the Orion Nebula  a huge cloud of gas and dust  about 25 light years across and 1 300 light years away.

If you look up in the sky tonight towards the west  after sunset  you will see the crescent Moon. Below the Moon and slightly towards the north you will see the red star Antares  in the constellation of the Scorpion. Continuing down towards the claws of the Scorpion you will see the very bright planet Venus. Finally  down near the horizon you will see two planets  quite close together Mercury and Saturn. We don't often get to see Mercury in the evening sky as it is normally too close to the Sun to be seen.

Hello there  Geoff of the Obs here on his twofold odyssey to the northern hemisphere. To see the aurora borealis from Lapland and comet ISON from the USA. So far so good. On the flight from Singapore to Helsinki I woke and looked out towards Ursa Major  the Big Bear  Big Dipper or Wagon as some call it. The sky was amazingly clear at 12000m as you would expect. Just below and to the west was a faint but observable aurora. The technical term was “Yippee!”. So  by holding the camera hard against the window then shrouding it by using my jacket I was able to get a few shots of around 4 seconds before movement became too much on an issue. This shot was taken while above Russia. Some towns can be seen below the thin cloud cover.  While the camera was taking the dark frame after this image a very bright meteor shot through the field of view  D’oh about 4 seconds too late. No colour was visible to the eye but the camera (Canon 6D at ISO 6400) caught the beautiful pinks and later some greens. The curtain nature was clearly visible and I kept shooting until the battery was flat ☹. In another hour I will arrive in Helsinki then an overnight train to Rovaniemi for some more aurora  hopefully. All I need is for the Sun to continue to shoot charged particles at us at around 400km/s and some clear sky. Let me know if you want o see more of my astro-journey over the next two months.

The spring equinox is tomorrow  Monday 23rd at 6.44am. By the way it will continue to be on 23rd until the year 2020. Equinox’ means ‘equal night’ but it’s not really equal. Daylight starts when the very first limb of the Sun is seen coming up over horizon and it continues until the very last limb disappears in the west. So there’s always going to be just a bit more day than night.

Well here is an image taken during a tour tonight Wed 18 Sep 2013. Rather spectacular to the naked eye but by the time I called the other guide and had a look it had faded. We watched this for around 5 minutes move only a few degrees and fade as it dispersed. My colleague was able to look at it with our biggest telescope and said he could see a star-like object next to the cloud. Either a launch as some have suggested or a release of gas from a satellite  which has been done before in order to study the atmosphere. Either way it was another great night viewing at Sydney Observatory. The image is blurred as it was hand held but I've circled the fading diffuse object. Cheers.

Don’t you love it when things just seem to line up? Astronomers tend to get very excited when this happens as it can be a great opportunity to observe something unusual  useful and often quite simply beautiful. Solar and lunar eclipse are the most well know examples of a syzygy  three celestial bodies in a line but there are other types too. Tomorrow  Monday 4 August the Moon will be directly between us and the jewel of the night sky – Saturn. This is known as an occultation and they can be surprisingly common with 11 visible somewhere around the Earth this year. For Sydney-siders it will be the third this year though the first in Feb was during the day. The last was on May 14 and the next one after Aug won’t be until ANZAC day 2019.   So what will you see? Look to the West from around 8:45pm and locate the Moon in the constellation of Libra. About ½ a degree above  or half the width of your outstretched pinkie at arm’s length  look for a slightly yellow star-like object  Saturn. Over the next half hour the Moon will sink lower into the west but more slowly than Saturn and the gap between the two will close. At 9:22pm AEST the rings will kiss the dark limb of the Moon and then the planet will vanish for just under an hour. This first part  the disappearance  will be easy to see as Saturn won’t be overpowered by the bright part of the Moon.   At 10:13pm Saturn will reappear near Mare Australe (Southern Sea) when the Moon is just 30 degrees above the western horizon. At first Saturn will be hard to see in the glare of the Moon but well worth a try especially if you have a pair of binoculars or a small telescope.   We hope to broadcast the event live from the North dome telescope via our webpage  weather permitting  so please follow the link on our main page at www.sydneyobservatory.com.au  from 8:45pm onwards.

IF the weather had been clear this morning you may have noticed the very bright planet Venus in the constellation of Aries the Ram. Two years ago today however you would have seen it drift across or transit the face of the Sun. What a great day that was for Sydney Observatory and the team at the Powerhouse. We haven't started planning for the next transit of Venus yet as it's not until Dec 11 2117. Sadly I don't think I'll be here for that one :( Geoff of the Obs	HER	photo	67.14	37.09	63.54	25.77	18.20	12.09	2.20	2.20	0.00	0.00	1.10	2.20	0.00	2.20	3.30	1.10	5.49	3.30	0.00	0.00	2.20	2.20	0.00	1.10	0.00	0.00	1.10	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00
Sadly we will NOT see the new meteor shower this weekend from the southern hemisphere. It is expected to peak Saturday 24 May between 14:00 and 16:00 AEST  ie before sunset locally. At that time the constellation of Camelopardalis the giraffe will be 17 degrees below our Sydney horizon :(   If you have friends in the northern hemisphere please tell them to look near Polaris (it's easy to find) around 04:00-06:00 UT on 24 May.  Here is a great video from NASA about the shower http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw3hVTUQ43U	HER	photo	91.79	72.97	21.80	44.45	24.50	18.37	3.06	2.04	0.00	0.00	1.02	1.02	0.00	2.04	3.06	0.00	2.04	4.08	0.00	0.00	3.06	0.00	1.02	1.02	0.00	0.00	2.04	0.00	0.00	0.00	1.02	0.00

Saturn vanishes! Well for an hour or so. Wednesday 14 May 2014  most of Australia will see the Moon slide in front of and hide  or occult  the planet Saturn.   In Sydney it starts at 20:55 and will end at 21:59. We hope to stream live video from one of our telescopes to our Sydney Observatory webpage and still images to this page and the Virtual Telescope Project. All we need is...CLEAR SKY :)   BTW if you have binoculars get them out and enjoy the show.

We hope to broadcast the event live...weather permitting :)	HER	photo	99.00	85.38	19.27	97.58	19.00	19.30	7.02	1.75	0.00	0.00	1.75	0.00	7.02	1.75	1.75	0.00	0.00	3.51	0.00	0.00	5.26	0.00	5.26	1.75	1.75	0.00	1.75	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00

Seven days from today the Moon will glide between us and the Sun! If anyone has connections to make a trip to Antarctica for an annular eclipse it would be an awesome sight (can I come too?).   For us in Sydney the Moon will cover 52% of the Sun’ diameter at 5:15pm.   Weather permitting we hope to broadcast this live through a new and very powerful solar telescope. If you don’t have the correct eclipse glasses or filters PLEASE DO NOT TRY TO MAKE YOUR OWN ! (Yes we are shouting as it is so important to be careful).  The eclipse will start at 4:14pm AEST and the maximum will be at 5:15pm just two minutes before the Sun sets.   We have no doubt that some will try to take a “safe” unfiltered peek at the Sun when it sits low on the horizon but this MUST NOT be done. Permanent irreversible eye damage can be the dreadful result!   Please share this with as many people as you can. It is a beautiful event if viewed safely. More details to come :)	HER	photo	71.61	64.83	16.76	83.66	15.33	16.30	5.43	2.17	1.09	0.00	0.54	0.00	2.17	3.26	5.43	1.09	3.80	1.63	0.54	0.00	3.26	1.63	2.17	0.54	2.72	0.00	0.54	1.09	0.00	0.00	0.54	1.63
We've had a few requests about the Lyrid meteor shower that may peak today (22 Apr) at around 4pm AEST. Sadly for us in the South this is not a good chance to see meteors  but there are no guarantees either way. If anyone is keen to try you will need a perfectly clear view to the North with little to no light pollution over the next few nights. Look for the bright star Vega as shown in the map. It rises at around midnight but the part of the sky you need to see is BELOW that  so you need to wait until around 3am. Even at this time the radiant (apparent point source of the meteors) will be below the horizon. If the conditions are good you may see a meteor or two or...  Don't forget we can see around 6 per hour on any night. The best time is always a few hours before sunrise and look eastward. Good luck. BTW check spaceweather for the latest images.

One of the prettiest objects in the sky is perfectly placed now for those with a pair of binoculars or a small telescope. Start by finding the Southern Cross and its nearby pointers in Centaurus. From the pointer closer to the cross head towards the star Epsilon Centauri as shown on the map and then continue in the same direction and about the same distance to search for a small fuzzy blob. That's it! NGC 5139 or Omega Centarui. We now believe it is the core of a small galaxy that was ripped apart by our galaxy the Milky Way. There are perhaps one million stars and they are about 16 000 light years away. This image is a single 74 second image through a cheapish f5 200mm Skywatcher telescope on an EQ6 Pro mount.

Over the next week leading up to the total lunar eclipse don't overlook Mars which is presently in the constellation of Virgo and close to its brightest star called Spica. It's a lovely contrasting view with red Mars and Spica which is blue-white. While 'opposition' occurs tomorrow  Mars and Earth won't be at their closest until next week at about 92 million km. On the night of the eclipse Mars  Spica and the eclipsed Moon (before it ends at 18:25) will be in the same general area and well worth a peek.

Not wanting to sound like a broken record but...if the weather is clear over the next few days there is a great view in the East and the West early in the morning about an hour or more before sunrise. Look to the East for the very bright planet Venus on the border of Aquarius and Capricornus. More difficult to see is Mercury a little lower. Then turn to the West to see the beautifully  bright red Mars low in the constellation of Virgo and Saturn a little high in Libra.

Tomorrow  22 Feb 2014 there will be an interesting though very difficult to see astronomical event that is still worth a try. The Moon will block or occult the planet Saturn. You would need a tripod mounted pair of binoculars or telescope to stand any chance and the weather will need to be perfect. Look westward around 10am  for those of us in Sydney  and scan the upper right edge of the Moon for the small and very faint Saturn. PLEASE NOTE IT WILL BE VERY HARD TO SEE. It will vanish for about an hour but seeing it re-appear will be more difficult as the Moon will have sunk further into the west.   Australian Sky & Telescope (Feb/Mar 2014) on page 60 has provided these times for other cities.  Brisbane 9:12 to 10:14 AEST Canberra 9:59 to 11:07 AEDT  Melbourne 9:52 to 11:02 AEDT Hobart 9:53 to 10:55 AEDT Adelaide 9:14 to 10:29 ACDT Perth  the best place to be for this 5:57 to 7:23 AWST.

Enjoy :) Geoff of the Obs	HER	photo	94.38	70.08	50.35	99.00	11.40	31.58	12.28	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	1.75	0.00	0.00	1.75	1.75	0.00	5.26	0.00	0.00	1.75	0.00	0.00	1.75	0.00	0.00	1.75	0.00	1.75	0.00	0.00	0.00
With lots of rain there is always the good chance of a rainbow. Unlike the ice crystal halos from last week this one was a typical rainbow caused by water droplets in the air. This one from western Sydney is a very nice double. Look carefully at the second bow to see the colours are reversed from the primary. Canon 5D Samyang 14mm ISO 200 1/320s.

Mystery of the second halo solved thanks to Linda Gee. The beautiful 22 degree halo earlier today was supplemented by a second halo that had the Sun on its circumference. Known as a Parhelic circle they are apparently quite rare. More details can be found here  http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/parcirc.htm and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parhelic_circle. One of the best images is in an earlier post by Linda Gee. Well done to everyone that took and shared pictures  thank you :)	HER	photo	88.93	71.29	5.20	99.00	14.83	16.85	7.87	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	3.37	1.12	0.00	3.37	1.12	0.00	5.62	0.00	0.00	1.12	2.25	1.12	2.25	0.00	0.00	3.37	0.00	1.12	0.00	0.00	0.00
13 Feb 2014 ~12:53pm. This photo has had the contrast adjusted to make the rainbow or halos easier to see. These halos are caused by flat hexagonal ice crystals in cirrus clouds high up in the atmosphere. The Sun's light is bent or refracted through the ice to make the rainbows. Cool huh?

This weekend (Sat 15 Feb) the planet Venus will be at its greatest brilliancy for 2014. Look East and hour or two before Sunrise (6:30am AEDT) and it should be rather obvious just below the teapot of Sagittarius. At magnitude -4.6 it is about 25 times brighter than Sirius the dog star  brightest of the night time stars. A small telescope or good binoculars will show its crescent shape of about 25%. This is also a good chance to try some simple astro- night-scape photography. You don't need a huge telephoto lens as it's all about composition. Make sure your camera  preferably an SLR is mounted on a solid tripod. Open the lens aperture as wide as possible  ie small number like f2. Increase the ISO but not too much and you will need to see what is best for your camera and location. Use mirror lock if possible and a cable release to minimise vibrations. Try several different exposures and most importantly check the focus. It should be set to infinity (looks like an '8' on its side) but not all lenses are focused to infinity when the symbols say so. Take some test exposures and blow them up to check. Lastly make sure you share your results with us :)	HER	photo	78.73	57.42	17.62	92.67	15.29	16.36	4.21	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.47	1.87	3.27	5.14	2.34	4.67	3.27	0.47	0.00	0.93	1.40	3.27	1.87	0.00	0.00	0.47	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00

We all know the Moon orbits the Earth roughly once a 'moonth' but it is often hard to get a feel for hour much it moves day to day. If the weather co-operates tonight (10/2/2014) and tomorrow you can use the planet Jupiter as a marker. Tonight the Moon will be in Orion above and to the left of Jupiter. Tomorrow night it will be in Gemini above and to the right.

It's a beautiful night outside right now (9 Feb) and the gibbous Moon is well worth a look if you have some small binoculars or a telescope. Many people think it is best seen at the time of being full but there aren't any shadows like now. Try to spot the crater Copernicus about half way along the terminator (shadow line). The crater is about 90km across. 200mm f5 Skywatcher telescope  Canon 6D  1/100sec and 100ISO by Geoff of the Obs.

Just how hard is it to find comet Q2 Lovejoy? Quite hard in fact. The first image was taken Tue 30 Dec 2014 at 11:15pm with a 50mm Canon lens and 6D camera  20seconds at 800ISO. The second image is the same but the tiny green dot at the top has been highlighted to make it easier to find. Small isn't it! The third image was taken last night with a 500mm lens. You can also see how far the comet has moved in 24 hours by locating the small globular cluster near Sirius known as M79.

A FAINT Christmas comet is on the way! BUT  and yes it's a big BUT  it will be very hard to see until around 7 Jan and will at that point probably fade quite quickly. Comets can be extremely frustrating as I demonstrated last year by travelling to the northern hemisphere to see Comet ISON which imho was a total dud! This comet is the fifth found by Terry Lovejoy from Australia. It's called Comet Lovejoy C/2014 Q2. The map below has been produced by the the magazine Sky & Telescope. You will not be able to see it yet with the naked eye unless you have perfect vision and no light pollution but it should be faintly visible in binoculars. It looks like a another country side visit  weather permitting  for some photos this weekend :) We will keep you posted and here's hoping it gets brighter. Geoff from MAAS.

The meteors are coming!  Do you remember the story of Hansel and Gretel and the part where they left a trail? Well it’s a bit of a stretch but I think the asteroid 3200 Phaethon is an astronomical analogue of sorts. Over the next few days the Earth will move into the dust trail left behind by the asteroid and that signals the start of the of the annual Geminid meteor shower. Dust trails are usually a trait of comets but it has been suggested that as the asteroid travels close to the Sun it warms  cracks and ejects dust which must be bad for the asteroid but good for us watching from afar. Tiny pieces of dust hit Earth's atmosphere travelling at up to 32 km/s and disintegrate completely 73 km above Earth's surface. They appear as short sharp streaks of light coming from the region of the sky around the constellation of Gemini the twins  hence the name- Geminids. Expected to peak in the early mornings of December 13-14 observers in dark locations away from city lights in the northern hemisphere might see as many as 120 meteors per hour. So what will we see? Not as many but it is still the best chance for us all year. By the way  some think they may peak earlier so if you are up late or early (~1am onwards) look northward towards Gemini and good luck.

In 24 hours from now the Moon will be totally covered by the Earth's shadow:- totality. For just one hour from 9:25pm to 10:25pm AEDT 8/10/2014  all the sunsets and all the sunrises around the world will cast a deep 'reddish' hue on the eclipsed Moon. The colour as shown in the picture here is NOT what the eye will see as this was a few seconds exposure on a DSLR. No-one can predict if the colour will be red or coppery brown. As long as the weather holds it will be a great show. The lead up will start at 8:15pm in the north east as the Moon enters the Earth's shadow. Dust off your binoculars  small telescope and camera for a great view  weather permitting.

Aurora alert BUT not for the majority of us :( Earlier today the Sun unleashed directly at us with two eruptions called CMEs or Coronal Mass Ejections. www.spaceweather.com is indicating as much as an 80% chance of aurora tomorrow (12 Sep 2014) but as with all such alerts it has very little to no chance of being seen in Sydney or anywhere north of it in Australia. For friends and relatives in NZ  Tassy and the bottom of Australia it may be possible. Ditto for those way up north in Europe. if I could get back to Finland by tomorrow I would! Geoff of the Obs.

We are excited and delighted to have launched our brand new East Dome this morning at Sydney Observatory!  This visionary new structure includes a lift right up into the dome and to the new telescope  providing full accessibility to those with limited mobility. The Museum has also purchased a very special telescope  with an articulated eyepiece able to easily adjust to different heights for easy viewing of the night sky for people in wheelchairs. (This telescope is one of several in the world and the only one in the Southern Hemisphere!)  Another exciting aspect of the project is that the new building will house an exhibition  developed by MAAS  titled ‘Accessing the Sky’ which will highlight Sydney Observatory’s participation in the 1887 Carte du Ciel (Chart of the Sky) and Astrographic Catalogue projects to photograph and chart the entire celestial globe.  For more information about the new dome  read our blog posts here http://goo.gl/ERuuDw and here http://goo.gl/gM9xGN.

‘Mozziemoonageddon’ is here and the Moon is to blame  partly. It’s Supermoon Wednesday today  21 Jan 2015! What does that mean? Not much really unless you’re a mosquito but we want to share to avoid some confusion. The term ‘Supermoon’ is relatively new as astronomers prefer ‘perigee moon’ ie when the full or new moon is closest in its monthly orbit of Earth. The word perigee is from French and earlier Greek peri meaning close and gea from Gaia meaning Earth  hence close to Earth. Today’s Supermoon however is new moon so we don’t see a thing except perhaps the effect of the tides  big tides at that. In Sydney Harbour today at 9:35am AEDT the high tide was 2m! Apparently such spring or king tides can lead to salt water flowing into marshy areas and creating perfect conditions for mosquitoes to breed  darn. You won’t be able to see the Moon however tonight or tomorrow as it’s too close to the Sun however Friday night  weather and mozzies permitting  there should be a nice crescent moon setting in the West around 21:52.

Do you have a VERY clear view to the West? If so  just after sunset tonight you may be able to see the planets Venus and Mercury close together very low in the western sky. Mercury has already past its closest approach to Venus so today is possibly the best chance weather wise. The young crescent Moon will also swing by Venus on the 22nd just after sunset. The photo below was taken from the Nile Valley a few days ago by one of wonderful team Brenan :) BTW look how his position (Egypt) has changed the orientation of the planets to how we see them from Sydney as shown in the Stellarium iamge.

Comets and weather can be frustrating at times. This image was taken from near Bathurst  the limit of an after work drive  late on Thu 8 Jan 2015.

Hopefully everyone is getting ready to go comet hunting tonight BEFORE the Moon pops up in the East at 21:52 AEDT. If you are still up around 23:00 or so look to the East and you'll see the Moon just 5 degrees away from Jupiter. Both objects will be in the constellation of Leo.

Tonight's the night...sort of! If today remains clear and it's looking good now  tonight is probably the best chance for us in the south to see comet Lovejoy high in our night sky. About now it is as close to Earth as it will be for the next 8000 years at ~70 million km away. Over the next few weeks it moves closer to the Sun and brightens but further from us :( From our point of view it will also head towards the northern sky making it harder to see. Our friends in the north may be in a for a great view but comets are notoriously difficult to predict so we will have to wait and hopefully see. So  back to tonight and you should try this before the Moon pops up at 21:52 AEDT. If you have binoculars they will help a lot. Scan the sky to your left of the star Rigel or knee of Orion the hunter (see attached Stellarium map). Look for a small fuzzy or hairy blob and voilà. It's actually rather hard especially from suburban Sydney but if you don't try you will miss out. Good luck and well done Terry Lovejoy for finding his fifth comet. Geoff from MAAS.

Every year since 2003 (the last favourable opposition of Mars) we have been asked about a fake email that states the planet Mars will be as big as the Moon on 27 August. This year however there was an added twist that there would be TWO Moons. The answer to both is no. Mars is presently 485 times smaller than the Moon as we see it and we have no idea where the two Moon idea came from? So  tomorrow  27 Aug should be a normal day of 86400 seconds duration as we hurtle around the Sun at a comfortable 30km/s.

The Moon and the last hint of sunlight in the windows of a nearby building as seen from Fort Phillip at Sydney Observatory. BTW the Moon isn't blue but it is...! Tonight at 8:43pm AEST the Moon will be full for the second time this month. Due to a misinterpretation by the staff of the magazine 'Sky & Telescope' in 1946 the term "Blue Moon" came to mean the second full Moon in a month. It had previously been the third of four in a season. Whichever definition you use  it is rather cute.

Warwick Holmes worked for over four years at the European Space Agency (ESA) on the Rosetta/Philae mission to comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. He recently visited Sydney Observatory and brought along his model of the comet. It is difficult to photograph because it is jet black. The real thing is blacker still!

Tomorrow (14 July 2015) night is the last time we can say we are going to see a Solar System 'planet' up close for the first time! Yes we all know it's no longer a planet as it was excluded by vote just 7 months after New Horizons was launched in January 2006 but it's still very exciting to finally see Pluto and Charon in detail. So  what should you do? Look towards the north-east around 10pm into the constellation of Sagitarrius. You won't actually see a thing as Pluto is so small (about 2300 km diameter) and so far away (about 6 billion km) but at least you'll be looking in the right direction. Thanks to National Geographic you can watch it LIVE. Please note the link in the image below is INCORRECT.

Check your local weather report  have a snooze  then get up and look up around midnight onwards for meteors! Tomorrow morning is the expected peak for this year's Geminid meteor shower. For best results try not to be near bright lights  ie a city  and look north and up. There is a good probability that you may see some debris from the asteroid 3200 Phaethon collide with our upper atmosphere at astounding speed and create short sharp streaks of light know as meteors.

30 Oct 2015. There will be a bright Iridium flare for Sydney's eastern suburbs. At 20:19:51 the satellite designated as Iridium 22 while at a distance of 1519km will briefly reflect the Sun's light directly toward the eastern suburbs (it's a happy coincidence caused by a highly polished Main Mission Antenna). It will appear as a short lived (3-4 seconds) flash  or flare  at about magnitude -7. This is around 100 times brighter than the bright star Sirius. You will need to look 26° above the southern horizon. You can always look for these flares for your exact location using the Heavens-above website. Good luck and send us your photos. Geoff from MAAS.

Dr Rajan Chhetri is a guide at Sydney Observatory. He researches Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) and below discusses the interesting phenomenon that blacks holes might twinkle. We've all sung or heard the nursery rhyme "twinkle twinkle little star". Celestial objects of a certain small size twinkle (for example stars twinkle  but the Moon does not). Twinkling of the stars is caused when light from distant stars arrives to us through different paths when traveling through Earth's atmosphere  due to the atmospheric turbulence.

Over the next few weeks there will be four planets visible in the pre-dawn sky that are easy to see and one that's a bit tough. At around 5am look North for the bright planet Jupiter then down to your right for slightly reddish Mars  down again to the right for the slightly yellow beige Saturn and then very bright Venus. Mercury is going to be hard to see but the best chance is the first few days  of February. Good luck.

Is there a planet orbiting Proxima Centauri  our closest night time star? In 1915 Robert Innes discovered that Proxima Centauri was our closest star not far from bright Alpha Centauri. Last year I wrote about the centenary of this discovery  its Australian connection and how to see Proxima Centauri for yourself.
