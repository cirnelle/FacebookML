We apologize but unfortunately our ordering system that we use automatically cancels orders placed with foreign credit cards and shipping or billing address based out of the US. Your order took a little longer to trigger cancellation due to the fact your requested shipping address was based in the United States.  We are working on solutions that will allow broader secure credit card acceptance in the future. Thank you again for sharing your suggestions.

In the meantime  mix up a lemon and strawberry and let us know if that comes close to pink lemonade. Kevin  Dictionary.com defines Skittles as "ninepins in which a wooden ball or disk is used to knock down the pins." We don't know anything about that. Your definition is much nicer.

Ashley  no lemonade yet  but maybe a handful of sour lemon skittles would do the trick instead.  Chris  just enact the 5 second rule. We won't tell if you want to extend that by a few hours.   Hey everyone   Check out Mix the Rainbow above. Just click and drag the Skittles to make your own track.

Another story about a special relationship between a BMW and its owner: Love knows no age. When the 19-year-old student Matyáš Homola (https://instagram.com/matyashomola/) bought his first car  it was obviously a hard decision as to what model to choose. But despite the fact he has always been into motorsports  he didn't opt for a new car. He is now the proud owner of a 1978 BMW 3 Series  so his car is two times older than him. Lovingly  he named his 3 Series „Colette“ and takes great care in maintaining the classic soul of the car - he even has plans for exhibitions and some rally competitions. We are quite sure  this couple will have a great future together. #BMWstories #legends The BMW i8 is a pioneer of its time; and there's no question that the right setting can add even more magic to the world's most progressive sports car.

Fabian's passion for cars began when he was a little boy. From his position in the backseat  he watched the vehicles that passed and tried to recognise each model just by looking at their headlights. Later  after he and his father went to see the Ennstal-Classic Rally  Fabian became more and more fascinated by youngtimer and classic vehicles. And so the first car he bought did not roll directly off the production line  but it came rather with a great history. He chose the BMW 520i  built in 1987. This photo was taken after his good friend had given him a lift to where his BMW 520i was waking up from its winter sleep. #BMWstories #legends  A BMW story shared by https://www.facebook.com/fabian.winkler.7 The all-new BMW 7 Series is the world’s first series-produced car that owners will be able to manoeuvre in or out of forward-parking spaces or garages without anyone at the wheel. The Remote Control Parking function allows the driver to conveniently hop out of the vehicle before parking it. The driver activates the remote-controlled parking function from outside the vehicle via the BMW display key. The entire parking procedure is monitored by Park Distance Control (PDC)  the Parking assistant and the Surround View sensors. In order to use the remote-controlled parking function  the vehicle has to be straight and centered  facing the parking space or garage. During the parking procedure the driver can bring the vehicle to a controlled stop if necessary. Once parked  the engine can be switched off via the key. And when it's time to move on  the engine can also be restarted via the key. #drivingluxury DRIVING LUXURY.  The all-new BMW 7 Series represents precision and contemporary design wherever you look.
