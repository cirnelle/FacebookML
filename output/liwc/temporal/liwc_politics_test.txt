The Trade Union Royal Commission yesterday demanded that the Victorian branch of Australian Labor Party hand over the personal details of 9 000 ordinary  rank and file party members – their names  contact details  credit card information and union membership.   This is a chilling intrusion into the personal affairs of thousands of ordinary Australians simply on the basis of their political affiliation. It’s an attack on freedom of association  a fundamental right of our democratic system.  The Royal Commission was forced to back down after Labor objected  but if there was ever any doubt that this Government’s Royal Commission was a political witch hunt  this revelation has laid those doubts to rest.

One year ago  our nation was shaken by brutal and heartless acts of violence that occurred in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu and in Ottawa on Parliament Hill. We are grateful for all the brave men and women who sought to keep us safe on October 22.   Today our thoughts and prayers remain with the loved ones of Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent and Cpl. Nathan Cirillo who tragically lost their lives. We continue to grieve with their families.   Our servicemen and women  who have put their lives on the line for their country  stand for the very best of what it means to be Canadian. We will live up to our sacred obligation to Canada’s men and women in uniform  our veterans  and their families.   As I said in addressing the country last year  the picture in our minds – of Canadians helping and protecting Canadians – that is who we truly are  and it is who we shall continue to be.   We will not allow threats to shape us  nor bow to those who mean to undermine our values and way of life. Canadians are kind and generous  open-minded  and optimistic. We know that Canada was built by people from all corners of the world  who worship every faith  who belong to every culture  and who speak every language.   Today  on this solemn anniversary  I join Canadians from coast to coast to coast in committing that we shall continue moving forward  together.

I am appalled that Washington's latest budget deal will raid $150 billion from the Social Security Trust Fund. Social Security is a promise to America's seniors-not a piggybank slush fund for Washington politicians. Americans shouldn't sacrifice their Social Security benefits so we can bailout irresponsible Washington politicians.  This is typical Washington  like when ObamaCare raided $700 billion from the Medicare Trust Fund.  I have a better idea  let's reform the disability insurance program  which is full of endless waste  fraud and abuse. Instead of stealing benefits from seniors  let's protect Social Security  preserve Medicare and keep our promises to seniors.

Australians have woken up to the news that Malcolm Turnbull and the Liberals want to increase the GST to 15%  and look at adding it to fresh food  education and health care costs.  Why does Malcolm Turnbull want hard-working Australians to pay more tax but refuse to make big multinationals pay their fair share?    A 15% GST will cost hard working families up to $4000 a year  despite wages not keeping up with the cost of living in Australia.    Labor stands against increasing the GST because we shouldnt be making Australians pay more for the things they need most.

An interesting read in yesterday's Guardian by the wonderful author  Alan Bennett.   I'm touched and honoured that he said in the interview: “I approve of him. If only because it brings Labour back to what they ought to be thinking about.”  And he makes important points about Labour's policy of bringing railways back into public ownership:  "Bennett  a regular passenger on the east coast mainline  said the opposition leader was “absolutely right” to want to nationalise the railways and that privatising it the “was pure ideology” of the Conservative-led coalition government. “It was making a profit and there was no reason to sell it back again ” Bennett explained. “No good arguments have been advanced for it.”	HER	link	72.89	72.51	8.65	97.19	19.50	28.21	5.98	0.85	0.00	0.85	0.00	2.56	4.27	2.56	0.85	1.71	0.85	0.00	1.71	0.85	0.00	2.56	6.84	2.56	0.85	0.00	0.00	0.85	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00

Today  I had the pleasure of introducing our team of extraordinary Canadians who will serve as Ministers in your new government. As a Canadian  you expect to see your values and priorities reflected in your government – and we have listened closely. Our strong  diverse  and experienced team will serve all Canadians  and – for the first time in our country’s history – there will be an equal number of women and men around the Cabinet table.  Over the course of the campaign  we promised you a government that will bring real change – in both the things we do and the way we do them. We will immediately start implementing our plan for a strong and growing middle class. On Election Day  you sent a clear message  and you rightly expect us to fulfill our promises.  I am writing to you  today  to reaffirm my commitment to spend the next four years working hard to deliver on those promises. It is time for leadership that never seeks to divide Canadians  but takes every single opportunity to bring us together  including in Parliament.  We made a commitment to invest in growing our economy  strengthening our middle class  and helping those working hard to join it. We committed to fighting climate change and protecting our environment. We made a commitment to provide more direct help to those who need it by giving less to those who do not. We committed to public investment as the best way to spur growth  job creation  and economic prosperity. And we committed to a responsible  transparent fiscal plan for challenging economic times. We expect you to hold the government accountable for delivering these commitments.  Our country faces many real and immediate challenges – from a struggling middle class to the threat of climate change. If we are to overcome these obstacles  Canadians need to have faith in their government’s honesty and willingness to listen. That is why we committed to set a higher bar for openness and transparency in Ottawa. Government and its information must be open by default. Simply put  it is time to shine more light on government to make sure it remains focused on the people it was created to serve – you.  But in order for you to trust your government  you need a government that will trust you. When we make a mistake – as all governments do – it is important that we acknowledge that mistake and learn from it. We know that you do not expect us to be perfect – but you expect us to work tirelessly  and to be honest  open  and sincere in our efforts to serve the public interest.  Before the election  we also made a commitment to bring new leadership and a new tone to Ottawa. Moving forward  we will pursue our goals and objectives with a renewed sense of collaboration. We fully understand and appreciate that partnerships with provincial  territorial  and municipal governments are vital to deliver the real  positive change that we promised you.  It is also time for a renewed  Nation-to-Nation relationship with Indigenous Peoples  one based on a recognition of rights  respect  co-operation  and partnership. Not only is this the right thing to do  but it is also a sure path to economic growth.  To close  I am deeply grateful to have this opportunity to serve you – and every Canadian across our great country. I am committed to leading an open  honest government that is accountable to Canadians  lives up to the highest ethical standards  brings our country together  and applies the utmost care and prudence in the handling of public funds.  Thank you for having faith in me. Thank you for putting your trust in our team.  We will not let you down.  Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  P.C  M.P.

As further evidence of the Tasmanian Liberal Government's commitment to cutting red tape to allow business to grow and create more jobs  I'm pleased that the popular sport paintball has now been fully legalised in the state.

I look forward to the first paintball businesses providing another fun activity to enjoy in Tasmania’s outdoors.

Tonight  going through all of your questions  I wanted to touch on a few issues that seem to be asked by many people.    I would like to deal with one question tonight in some detail.  The issue is experience.  Several people ask what they should tell their friends when people say “I like Carson but he has no political experience”.    You are absolutely right — I have no political experience.  The current Members of Congress have a combined 8 700 years of political experience.  Are we sure political experience is what we need.  Every signer of the Declaration of Independence had no federal elected office experience.  What they had was a deep belief that freedom is a gift from God.  They had a determination to rise up against a tyrannical King.  They were willing to risk all they had  even their lives  to be free.  Today we find ourselves with an entire class of politicians.  No one in Philadelphia  during that summer our nation was born  dreamed that service was a career with a pension.  America was the land of the Citizen Statesmen.  They were merchants  lawyers  farmers — and yes  even doctors.  They were willing to stand for freedom.  Today  the political class stands in the way  not for the people.  They demand pensions and perks.  This is not what our Founders envisioned for America.  I spent my life treating very ill children.  Over 15 000 times I gave my all to prolong their lives.  I was blessed to do it.  But when it came time for me to retire  I simply could not sit back any longer.  These children became my family.  What our government is doing to them is outrageous.  I am prepared to risk all that I have to try and make a difference in their future. I built one of the nation’s best medical centers.  I served for two decades on the boards of Costco and Kellogg.  I built a national scholarship program.  My experience is very different than what we have come to expect.  I grew up poor.  I know what it is like to be homeless and hungry.  I know the pain of poverty.  I also know that education and a mother’s love can be the path out of dire poverty.  I know what it is like to see water fountains you are not allowed to drink out of because of your skin color.  I also know that once you peel back the skin  the brain is the same no matter what your skin color or continent you live on.  I know that victimhood is a trap.  I know that it is our Christian responsibility to offer those less fortunate a hand up.  I know my faith is strong and my ego is small.  I know that my path to the White House is different than most.  But I also know I bring all of the pain and joy  the success and failure  the lessons learned through love and sorrow in my life’s journey.  Bill Clinton was famous for saying “I feel your pain” — well  I have walked in your shoes.  I do not have political experience  I have a life journey.  A journey that not only made it possible for me to relate to so many different people  but also one where time and time again I was told I would fail  only to succeed.  My candidacy is different  that I grant you.  I have neither Donald Trump’s money or Jeb Bush’s political network.  However  I wouldn't trade a single child I treated for all of Trump’s money.  While I admire the Bush family’s dedication to service  I too served —  nights  weekends  holidays  birthdays and anniversaries with severely injured patients were my public service.  I didn’t go to embassy cocktail parties or beg lobbyists for money.  I spent night after night in a quiet  sterile room trying to save the life of a small child.  That was my life’s service.  This is my life’s experience.  What I have is a lifetime of caring  integrity and honesty.  I have experienced the American Dream.  No where in the world  other than America  could a man whose ancestors were slaves  rise to become a leading brain surgeon and one day seek the Office of President.  The very fact that I am running is testament to the greatness of America.  If all you want is political experience then I cannot be your candidate.  Thank you for staying up with me.   Goodnight     Ben	HER	status	56.69	43.05	67.09	56.22	12.61	19.35	3.23	1.61	0.27	0.13	0.40	2.96	0.81	1.48	1.75	1.61	3.76	0.54	0.40	1.21	2.02	1.34	6.05	0.67	0.54	0.00	0.00	0.27	0.13	0.00	0.00	0.00

On the 70th anniversary of the end of the Second World War  we honour in particular those who gave their lives to defeat fascism. In their memory  and that of all who have suffered or lost their lives in war  let us resolve to build a world of peace.

Today we marked the 25th anniversary of my friend and mentor Paul Wellstone's first Senate campaign (that green bus/no one thought he could win/defying the odds 1990 victory) with an event at Sam and Sylvia Kaplan's house.  So many wonderful stories.  Thanks to Paul  I learned how to campaign on city buses. We’d get on a bus  shake everyone’s hands  then get off a few blocks later and get on a bus going the opposite way. That was how we did it – up and down Nicollet Mall. And yes  we paid every time!  People always rightfully talk about Paul's advocacy and passion  but what we remembered today was the sheer joy he brought to grassroots campaigning and meeting people. In a day of consultants and talking points and hard-edged personal attacks  it was good to remember the joy Paul brought to politics  the work he did across the aisle  and the mission that got him through each day: Politics  he said  was about getting things done to improve people's lives. We miss you  Paul.	HER	status	76.97	92.90	22.08	77.71	19.67	19.77	4.52	1.69	0.56	0.56	0.56	2.26	1.13	0.56	0.00	1.69	1.13	0.56	0.56	1.13	3.95	2.82	6.78	4.52	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.56	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.56

Equal Pay Day - If you are a woman who works full time you will effectively be working for free from now until the end of the year  due to the gender pay gap.  Walking around Parliament  I am reminded of the heroic struggles that have led to greater equality for women  at least in the eyes of the law. Whether Emily Wilding Davison trying to drape this scarf over the King's horse  Marjorie Hume chaining herself to this statue or the Equal Pay Act itself.   The 1968 Ford sewing machinists strike  popularised by the film Made in Dagenham  ensured equal pay was firmly on the agenda and Barbara Castle duly tabled the Equal Pay Bill which came into force fifty years ago.  However  these gains are being eroded: the Conservative's introduction of employment tribunal fees means that it now costs women £1 200 to bring forward an equal pay claim.This has also meant that twice the number of pregnant women and new mothers have been forced out of their jobs compared with a decade ago.   Kate Green MP  Labour's Shadow Minister for Women and Equalities  said today  "It’s no good the Tories talking about equal pay when their policies stop women from getting fair treatment at work."

I've just joined my Labour colleagues  who have voted against the Conservative's Trade Union Bill this evening. This Bill is an affront to democracy and seeks to restrict our Party's relationship with trade unions. 6.4 million British people belong to this mass grass-roots movement - I am proud to be one of them.   There are many worrying aspects of the Bill  including the introduction of a  50% turnout threshold for strike ballots. This is despite many of the MPs who are voting for this Bill not receiving the vote of 50% of their constituents. The Conservatives have said they want to modernise trade unions  but they have denied unions the ability to ballot members by phone or email.  Labour's Shadow Business Secretary  Angela Eagle MP  perfectly summarised this Bill when it was debated on 14 September  “It saddens me beyond words that we’re here today dealing with the most significant  sustained and partisan attack on six million trade union members and their workplace organisations that we have seen in this country in the last 30 years.”	HER	photo	82.56	76.99	9.32	35.71	25.14	23.86	1.70	1.14	0.57	0.57	0.00	0.00	0.57	0.57	1.14	0.57	2.84	1.14	1.14	0.00	8.52	1.70	1.14	0.57	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00

On the eve of Veterans Day  some of the billionaires and millionaires on stage talked about cutting earned benefits to seniors and disabled veterans. While we already have the biggest military in the world  Republicans talked about spending more money and fighting more wars  yet veterans sleep out on the streets tonight.

We must increase our efforts at home and abroad to improve our defenses  destroy terrorist networks  and deprive them of the space from which to operate.

America must stand with our allies against the scourge of radical Islamic terrorism. This is an evil that does not discriminate between French  German or American  Christian  Muslim or Jew  soldier  football player  or concert goer. Their only goal is to murder those who do not submit to their vicious  totalitarian ideology. Our deepest condolences go out to our French allies  and I know the government of the United States stands by to offer any assistance necessary.  We must now face the facts. Between the downing of the Russian jet over Egypt and this massive coordinated attack on Paris  we are seeing an unmistakable escalation of ISIS’ ambitions and the scale of their terrorist attacks outside Syria and Iraq. Even as chaos rages in Paris  we need to take immediate  commonsense steps to preserve our own safety. We need to consult closely with our NATO allies who may be targeted for additional attacks. We need to immediately declare a halt to any plans to bring refugees that may have been infiltrated by ISIS to the United States. We need to redouble our efforts to prevent ISIS agents from penetrating our nation by other means.  Such steps  however  are defensive reactions to an enemy that will continue to try to attack us until they succeed once again. We must immediately recognize that our enemy is not ‘violent extremism.’ It is the radical Islamism that has declared jihad against the west. It will not be appeased by outreach or declarations of tolerance. It will not be deterred by targeted airstrikes with zero tolerance for civilian casualties  when the terrorists have such utter disregard for innocent life. We must make it crystal clear that affiliation with ISIS and related terrorist groups brings with it the undying enmity of America—that it is  in effect  signing your own death warrant.

The events in Paris are the worst act of violence in France since the Second World War.   The worst terrorist attack in Europe in a decade.   A horrifying and sickening attack.   Our hearts go out to the French people  and to all those who lost loved ones.   Today the British and French people stand together  as we have so often before in our history when confronted by evil.   Shocked  but resolute.   In sorrow  but unbowed.   My message to the French people is simple:   Nous sommes solidaires avec vous.   Nous sommes tous ensemble.   We stand with you.   United.   While the full picture of what happened is still emerging  we know that there were multiple terror incidents across Paris and over 120 people are feared dead with many more injured.   We must be prepared for a number of British casualties  and we are doing all we can to help those caught up in the attack.   These were innocent victims enjoying a Friday night out with friends and family  no doubt at the end of a hard week.   They were not seeking to harm anyone.   They were simply going about their way of life – our way of life.   And they were killed and injured by brutal  callous murderers who want to destroy everything our two countries stand for.   Peace. Tolerance. Liberty.   But we will not let them.   We will redouble our efforts to wipe out this poisonous extremist ideology and  together with the French and our allies around the world  stand up for all we believe in.     I have just chaired a meeting of COBR to review the security situation here in the UK.   The threat level is already at severe  which means an attack is highly likely  and will remain so.   Our police and intelligence agencies work round the clock to do all they can to keep us safe.     Ever since the co-ordinated firearms attacks in Mumbai in 2008  we have all been working together to ensure we could respond to such an attack.   This Summer police and other emergency services carried out a major exercise to test our response for multiple firearms attacks.   And in light of last night’s attacks  we will review our plans and make sure we learn any appropriate lessons.   It is clear that the threat from ISIL is evolving.   Last night’s attack suggests a new degree of planning and co-ordination and a greater ambition for mass casualty attacks.   And we must recognise that however strong we are  however much we prepare  we in the UK face the same threat.   That’s why we continue to encourage the public to remain vigilant.     And we will do all we can to support our police and our intelligence agencies with the resources and capabilities they need.   The terrorist aim is clear.   It is to divide us and to destroy our way of life.   So more than ever we must come together and stand united.   And carry on with the way of life we know and love.   I hope to speak to President Hollande later today and I will make clear that we will do whatever we can to help.   Your values are our values.   Your pain is our pain.   Your fight is our fight.   Together we will defeat these terrorists.

Yesterday morning  President Obama declared that we had “contained ISIS.”  Yet a week ago  ISIS murdered 224 people aboard a Russian plane  and now Friday night  Paris was struck by a multi-layered attack that resulted in over 125 people murdered  many more wounded  and a world again left in shock.  We are clearly not dealing with leashed animals or with a JV team.  We’re dealing with a threat to western civilization.  During the debate last week  I stated that we should not admit those claiming to be Syrian refugees and was condemned by the left for that position.  I was right and the events in Paris affirm that.  Even the far left and politically correct government of France has closed its borders.  It’s time for a President who will act to protect Americans  not just talk and protect the image of Islam.   I call for the following:   1.  Close our borders instead of Guantanamo.  2.  Institute an immediate moratorium on admission to those persons from countries where there is strong presence of ISIS or Al-Qaeda. 3.  Build a coalition that will include NATO  Russia  and nations of the Middle East to aggressively destroy ISIS.  Nations who refuse to participate will be sanctioned and isolated. 4.  Revoke any agreement with Iran regarding their nuclear capacity.  Radical Islamists  whether Sunni or Shia  are a clear and present danger to civilization.

Today  a country is grieving. And I think it's fair to say that the world is grieving  as one of the most beautiful cities on our earth was marred by terrorism  tragedy  and violence.    It's hard to know what to say at a moment like this—when citizens who only wanted to join together to listen to music on a Friday night  watch soccer  or enjoy dinner with friends  have had their lives forever changed by explosions and gunfire.    As a former Mayor  I know a small piece of what it is to have to think about the potential of these kinds of horrors—to stand up in the face of tragedy and lead. My heart is with Mayor Anne Hidalgo  with President Hollande  in what is a most impossible time.   For the days to come we'll hear speculation  and sweeping generalizations about our Muslim brothers and sisters around the world who largely condemn these acts. We'll hear words motivated only by fear and ignorance.   I hope we will turn deaf ears to hatred. Let us instead listen to voices throughout the globe that speak of love  unity and peace. Let us be our best selves in the face of terrorism.

Some people have told me in the last couple of days that they couldn’t sleep after the first images started to come in from Paris on Friday night. Others have said that they had unexpected crying fits  or the shakes.   Of all the horrors that have taken place recently in the world  these massacres seem so immediate – because they are immediate: geographically  culturally  politically  spiritually. Paris is our sister city  just a couple of hours away on the train – a place you can go to for lunch  a city that in the last few years has despatched so many talented workers to London that I am the proud mayor of one of the biggest French towns in the world.   And so there is always one question that people want to ask me  even if – for fear of seeming selfish - they leave it unspoken. That question is: Could it happen here? Is London going to be hit by shootings on that scale?   The answer is that even though I think an attack of that particular type is unlikely  and even though we are doing everything in our power to prevent it  I am afraid that it would be impossible – and irresponsible – to rule it out completely.   How could we rule it out? Yes  of course the police and the security services are doing an amazing job – with the resources they have – in monitoring the thousands of potential suspects (perhaps 3 000-4 000)  some of them clearly more dangerous than others. They foil all sorts of plots  half-baked or otherwise. They make arrests with great frequency. But it is plainly no use hoping that the problem of Daesh-inspired terrorism is going away.  Just in the last few months we have seen appalling loss of British life on the beach in Tunisia; we have seen a Russian passenger jet blown out of the sky; and now 129 people killed in Paris  in the most vicious and shocking fashion  and many others seriously wounded.   Several people over the weekend have echoed the sentiments of the excellent French ambassador to London  Sylvie-Agnes Bermann  who said that this massacre was qualitatively different from the Charlie Hebdo shootings in January. This  she said  was a 9/11 moment. This was an act of war. I agree. And as we deliberate on how to respond  it is essential to be cautious  and to be pragmatic – and yet to use every weapon at our disposal.  First of all we need to catch the bastards before they strike; and I am afraid that I have less and less sympathy with those who oppose the new surveillance powers that the government would like to give the security services.   To some people the whistleblower Edward Snowden is a hero; not to me. It is pretty clear that his bean-spilling has taught some of the nastiest people on the planet how to avoid being caught; and when the story of the Paris massacre is explained  I would like a better understanding of how so many operatives were able to conspire  and attack multiple locations  without some of their electronic chatter reaching the ears of the police. I want these people properly spied on  properly watched – and I bet you do  too.   Second  we need to be able to intercept them at frontiers. I know Molenbeek  the melancholy Brussels suburb that is said to have produced some of the Paris killers. I remember happy hours walking its bemerded and frituur-smelling streets  and alas I am not surprised to find – a generation later – that some of those scampering North African children have grown up to become jihadis.    What are the implications for the security of Europe  if you can load your car with Kalashnikovs in Molenbeek  and drive unimpeded not just to Paris but to any EU capital you please?  The Paris massacres – as the French have implicitly confirmed  by trying to control their own frontiers – have greatly strengthened the hand of David Cameron as he argues for better control at the borders. And yet it is not enough just to spy on them.   It is too late to try to catch them  once they have pupated into proto-terrorists. We must intercept them before the metamorphosis begins. We need to get the antidote down their throats before the poisonous death-cult takes over their minds. That means working ever harder to enlist the vast majority of Muslims who despise Daesh (so I propose to call them  since it is a shame to play their game and use the word Islamic in their title)  and who can help most powerfully in differentiating their abominable doctrines from the teachings of the Koran.   It means working with the families  and coming down hard on parents who – all too often  alas – are allowing their kids  of both sexes  to go online and imbibe the jihadi madness: the ranting sermons  the home-made hydrogen peroxide suicide belts  and all the rest of the claptrap.   We need to be much faster and much cleverer in beating the absurd propaganda from Raqqa. How hard can that be? Their “caliphate” is savage  dysfunctional  and so scary that many British would-be jihadis end up pleading to come home. But there it is – a breeding-ground of terror; and it looks very much as if at least one of the Paris killers actually came from Syria  via Leros. And so we come to the last of our possible responses – the military one. All the generals I have talked to are leery.   They want to understand the mission  and how we propose to achieve it. Would we go in with Putin? Would we effectively be backing Assad? No choice looks attractive; no plan is perfect. But is doing nothing any better? It is more than two years since the government was defeated in its plan to intervene in Syria  and the rhythm of terror would appear to be increasing.   These people avowedly want to destroy us  and in those circumstances no military option can be off the table. This is a fight we will one day inevitably win – because in the end our view of the human spirit is vastly more attractive and realistic than theirs. But we won’t win if we don’t fight back.

President Obama's wimpish and amateurish response to Islamic jihadists this morning reveals we have a Cub Scout for Commander in Chief instead of someone who is capable of defending America and unleashing something more than a strongly worded letter through the UN. It's embarrassing when a left-wing socialist French President shows strength and determination to eradicate animals who are slaughtering innocent civilians while our President lectures us on the moral necessity to open our borders to tens of thousands of un-vetted people from the Middle East. France has closed its borders and all President Obama wants to do is close Gitmo.  And in the GOP  Speaker Ryan needs to make it clear that if the President won't stand to protect America from wholesale open borders  then Republicans will. If Ryan will not lead and reject the importation of those fleeing the Middle East without assurances that we can separate refugees from terrorists  then Speaker Ryan needs to step down today and let someone else lead.

Official Statement from Dr.Ben Carson:  Today  I am asking Congress to stop the Obama Administration’s plans to bring in up to 45 000 Syrian refugees. There is currently no ability to vet these people.  By letting refugees into our country without vetting we are putting America at risk. If our President cannot see the risk  then we must rise to the challenge and protect our country. This morning President Obama announced at his press conference that it was our responsibility to accept these refugees. He is wrong. He took an oath to protect and defend this country. There is simply not a way to vet these refugees.   We should do everything in our power to help these men  women  and children who have been forced to flee their country  but until we can sort out the bad guys  we must not be foolish. I call for increased aid to the refugees. We can and should do more to feed the hungry and shelter the homeless. We must also protect them from being attacked by implementing immediately no fly zone over these camps.  President Obama said this morning that it would be a mistake to send more ground troops. I think plenty of mistakes have already been made. As President  I would give the mission to the Pentagon  and ask them what they need to accomplish the mission. The right number of boots on the ground is whatever number the Pentagon says they need to accomplish that mission and not a single person less. The error of armchair quarterbacking our military will end in my administration. They will get the support they need and nothing less. Both the FBI and former Intelligence Committee Chairman  Mike Rogers  have indicated that it is not possible to fully vet these refugees as there is no Syrian list to vet against. Allowing these refugees to enter our country without knowing who they are is foolish. I am talking to many experts as I can  and I have yet to find one who thinks that the Obama Syrian/ISIL strategy is anything but a failure. The only thing that President Obama seems to have contained is this foolish policy inside his government.   We need to offer more than empty tough talk. We need to say what we mean  and most importantly mean what we say. When we draw a line in the sand or boundary in the air  the world needs to understand that we mean it. Too many people across the world today think that we don’t.

Every American has been appalled and disgusted by the attack against the people of Paris by the terrorist organization ISIS. I know all of us send our condolences to the families of those who lost loved ones. And we pray for the recovery of all those who were injured  many of them seriously.  In my view  now is the time for developing a serious and effective approach to destroy ISIS. Now is not the time for taking cheap political advantage of this tragedy. Now is the time – as President Obama is trying to do – to unite the world in an organized campaign against ISIS that will eliminate the stain of ISIS from this world. But let me also say that now is not the time for demagoguery and fear mongering. What terrorism is about is trying to instill terror and fear into the hearts of people. And we will not let that happen. We will not be terrorized or live in fear. During these difficult times  we will not succumb to Islamophobia. We will not turn our backs on the refugees who are fleeing Syria and Afghanistan. We will do what we do best and that is be Americans – fighting racism  fighting xenophobia  fighting fear.  Well  in 2002 we had a president  George W. Bush  who was very tough – but not very smart. He invaded Iraq and we are reaping the consequences of that war today: 6 700 dead Americans  hundreds of thousands wounded  $5 trillion spent and massive instability in the region – chaos which allowed the rise of ISIS. Yes  we have to be tough but not stupid. Yes  a worldwide coalition must defeat ISIS. But no  the United States must not be involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.

Tonight  I will be going to the England vs France match at Wembley stadium. It is important we show solidarity with all those affected by the tragic events that took place in Paris on Friday.   It is right that we are reflecting on the appalling attacks in Paris and how we agree an effective international response. That needs to focus on negotiating a comprehensive settlement of the Syrian civil war through the United Nations  which is the only way to end the threat from ISIS.    That is the serious challenge facing us all. I am therefore disappointed that comments I made yesterday in regard to a "shoot to kill" policy have been taken out of context and have distracted from this discussion.  Nonetheless  I would like to clarify my position. As we have seen in the recent past  there are clear dangers to us all in any kind of shoot to kill policy. And we must ensure that terrorist attacks are not used to undermine the very freedoms and legal protections we are determined to defend.  But of course I support the use of whatever proportionate and strictly necessary force is required to save life in response to attacks of the kind we saw in Paris.

New Yorkers aren’t afraid of our diversity.  On Tuesday  I was in Cambridge talking with students at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government  when I was asked how we should treat immigrants  how we should balance security with acceptance. I think many forces are trying to politicize this  but this goes deeper than politics. It goes to the core of who we are as a nation.  If the day comes when America says “close the gates  build the wall ” then I say take down the Statue of Liberty  because we’ve gone to a different place. The poem on the Statue of Liberty reads  “Give me your tired  your poor  your huddled masses yearning to breathe free ” On the day this is no longer true  we will have lost sight of who we are.  I won’t let the reactionaries win by conceding the defeat of the American Dream.  I have a question for the Governors who say they will refuse to let the refugees in: How?   Where does it say in your state’s constitution that you can refuse a person placed by the Federal Government? What are you going to do  have your militia stand on the borders of your state? It’s up to the Federal Government. If they let refugees in and place them in your state  Governors have no authority to turn them down.   Having said that  this is a complex issue.  We have to protect Americans. The Federal Government has to screen the people who are coming in. They have to do it right  do it exhaustively  but do so without giving up our soul as Americans.  The next time the Republican candidates take to a podium  they’re going to try and confuse the issue  talk about how immigrants are the problem  to use this as a justification to make us afraid of them  and to further divide us. That’s not how we think in New York. Here in New York  we aren’t afraid of our immigrants  we celebrate them. As I've said many times before  in New York our diversity is our strength.   The Statue of Liberty is still in the harbor  and the doors are open.

The truth is that Syrian refugees already go through a very laborious vetting process. And for us to say  as a nation  ‘we’re not taking any  or we’re only taking the Christian refugees ’ is for us to play into the hands of ISIL and to give them a huge recruiting tool in their effort to try to portray this as a war between two world religions  which it is not.

Before the last election  I promised to walk the lands of the Liverpool Plains to better understand the concerns of our farmers in our most important food bowl.   Today I'm back here again to listen to the locals and talk through how we can navigate the future together.   Farming is incredibly important to the future of NSW  and I'm committed to protecting the black soils of the Plains to ensure the viability of farming for generations to come.   The hard bit is... Mining is also a key part of NSW economy  providing many thousands of jobs across the state.   Ensuring a viable coexistence of these crucial industries sure isn't simple  especially when they need to coexist in close proximity. There are no easy answers... But I'm committed to working hard to find the best path forward.   Thanks to the locals who made time for us today. We'll see you again soon.

"People are fed up with a so-called free market system that has delivered grotesque inequality  stagnating living standards for the many  calamitous foreign wars without end and a political stitch-up which leaves the vast majority of people shut out of power or influence."  This was the beginning of a speech I gave in Bristol yesterday. A speech that outlines the three pillars which everything we do will be based on:  The first pillar is the new politics: the democratisation of public life from the ground up. Giving people a real say in their communities and workplaces; breaking open the closed circle of Westminster and Whitehall  and boardrooms too.  The second pillar of our project for Britain is a new economy. It’s anti-austerity economics; that goes without saying. Austerity is a political choice  not an economic necessity. But what Labour now stands for is far more than stopping the damage being done by the Tories. We want to see a break with the failed economic orthodoxy that has gripped the establishment for decades. We want to see the reindustrialization of Britain for the digital age.  The third pillar of our vision for Britain is a different kind of foreign policy - based on a new and more independent relationship with the rest of the world. A relationship where war is a last resort. We must reflect on the past 14 years  that has seen Britain at the center of a succession of disastrous wars  that have brought devastation to large parts of the wider Middle East.

David Cameron just gave a statement to the Commons on the Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) - in other words  the government's military and security plans for the next five years.  In the light of the Paris attacks  police numbers are obviously vital to public security. As at PMQs last week  I again asked him about the cuts to the police front line  which senior police officers have warned against.   As you can see here  Cameron preferred to make a cheap jibe. He then refused to answer any questions about the danger of cuts to the police front line.  By pressing ahead with these cuts  the government is failing in its most basic duty: to protect our citizens. These cuts pose a direct threat to the security of our own people.

David Cameron is preparing to ask MPs  for a second time in two years  to vote for militarily intervention in Syria.   Labour will consider his proposals  but in our view  the dreadful Paris attacks strengthens the case for an international effort to reach a negotiated settlement of the Syrian civil war - and end the threat from Isis.   It is the conflict in Syria and the consequences of the Iraq war which have created the conditions for Isis to thrive and spread its murderous rule.   It is vital at a time of tragedy and outrage not to be drawn into responses which feed a cycle of violence and hatred. As the US president Barack Obama said recently  Isis “grew out of our invasion of Iraq” and is one of its “unintended consequences”.   We must not keep making the same mistake - again and again.

Resettling refugees is a proud and important part of Canada’s humanitarian tradition. It reflects our commitment to Canadians and it demonstrates to the world that we have a shared responsibility to help people who are displaced and fleeing persecution. Protecting the safety  security  and health of Canadians and refugees is a key factor in guiding the Government of Canada’s plan to resettle 25 000 Syrian refugees as quickly as possible – while also taking the time to do it right.

I asked why nearly one third of those referred to women’s refuges in England are now turned away? He replied by saying  “we have put more money into refuges ” when at the start of his tenure (2010-11 to 2012) the Violence Against Women and Girls sector lost 31% of funding. Also  this doesn’t add up when organisations such as Eaves and others are closing or fighting for survival.   When I asked whether Cameron would ratify the Istanbul Convention which would make women’s support services statutory  he completely ignored the question and referred to the Autumn Statement.   In that statement  Osborne said that the money raised from taxing sanitary products will be put towards women's services. This is gesture politics. Sanitary products should not be taxed at all  and we should not be forced into a position where such unfair taxes have to be used to fill the void left by savage cuts.

Check out this photo of the front page of The Sun from 9 September 1947.  Today's campaign against penalty rates by the Liberal Party and their mates in big business is eerily reminiscent of comments from business in 1947 warning about 'the increased costs to be borne by the public' from the introduction of the 40-hour week  after campaigning against it.  Both the 40-hour week and penalty rates are good for Australia and good for our economy. Let's keep it that way.  #ThrowbackThursday	HER	photo	99.00	82.39	41.87	69.60	17.20	20.93	3.49	1.16	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	2.33	1.16	0.00	0.00	4.65	0.00	3.49	2.33	1.16	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00

On this Thanksgiving  as we gather with family and loved ones  we celebrate the blessings the Lord has bestowed upon us and this great nation. Particularly this year  as we face many uncertainties – from the threats of terror to economic hardships – let us take time to thank God for all that he has given us and ask for his provision in our lives and our country.  When we think back to that first Thanksgiving in 1621  and all that the Pilgrims endured  only half surviving the first brutal winter  we remember sacrifice upon which this land was built – and the sacrifice that continues to keep us free and safe. In the struggle for independence  the brave motley group of soldiers defeated the greatest military force in the world. In the battle against slavery  the blood shed to purge this people from our original sin. In the World Wars  the thousands who fought in the trenches and scaled the cliffs of Normandy to save the American idea.  We are grateful for all those who have gone before us and for those who continue to serve: for the soldiers  sailors  airmen  and Marines who courageously defend our freedom. For the police officers  firefighters  and first responders who protect our communities. And for the pastors  teachers  and parents who guide us to know the truth  and be set free by it.  And we remember President George Washington’s call in the first Thanksgiving Day Proclamation  226 years ago  to "unite in most humbly offering our prayers and supplications to the great Lord and Ruler of Nations  and beseech Him to pardon our national and other transgressions… to render our National Government a blessing to all the people… and to promote the knowledge and practice of true religion and virtue."  It is this hope in a Higher Ruler that inspired the Pilgrims to leave everything in pursuit of freedom  and it is this same Providence that  if we call upon the name of the Lord  will restore the promise of America.

It's great news that the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) have voted to come back to Labour  their vote marks a milestone in the building of our new politics and our labour movement.  There are 38 000 men and women members working in 2030 fire stations across the country who have been at the sharp end of austerity cuts.  I thank the FBU for this  vote of confidence in our new politics which believes investing in our public services is a matter of national pride.  Our National Executive Committee will now deal with the formalities  but to those FBU members who are now in a Labour-affiliating union for the first time  I look forward to extending a warm welcome.  And to those who are coming back to Labour with the union  I say welcome home.

Yesterday  I wrote to David Cameron due to concerns that the executions of Ali Mohammed al-Nimr  Dawood al-Marhoon and Abdallah al-Zaher could be imminent.  These young men were arrested and sentenced to death for their involvement in protests  when they were all under 18 years old.   Saudi Arabia is gravely breaching its international treaty obligations and this calls into question their value as an ally in our plans to build sustainable  long-term stability in the region. To be credible in our defence of human rights  we have to condemn all abuses regardless of whether they are committed by our allies or not.   When I last wrote to David Cameron about al-Nimr and al-Marhoon  I also raised the case of the Briton  Karl Andree. I am pleased that he is now home and the Foreign Secretary  Rt Hon Phillip Hammond MP explained  “It's through the strength and breadth of the relationship between our nations that we have been able to overcome a difficult issue like this.”   I asked Cameron to use that same relationship and personally intervene in the cases of these young men - to stop their executions and to ensure that their sentences are commuted.

This morning I was on the Andrew Marr Show  discussing my position on Britain extending bombing from Iraq to Syria.   It is the conflicts in Syria and Iraq which created the conditions for Isis to thrive and spread its murderous rule. And it is through political agreement to end the civil war - negotiated with all the external powers  backed by the United Nations and with Syrians in control of their own country - that Isis will be isolated and defeated.   As the US president Barack Obama said recently  Isis “grew out of our invasion of Iraq” and is one of its “unintended consequences”. We must not keep making the same mistake - again and again. Labour will always stand up to any threat to this country and our people. We will never leave Britain unprotected  but we need a different approach to foreign policy that puts peace  justice and real security first.

60 Years ago today  Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat to a white passenger on a segregated bus in Montgomery  Alabama. This simple act of civil disobedience to defend human dignity was one of the most important events in the civil rights movement history.   Parks’ actions resounded far beyond Montgomery  stimulating activism across America and it quickly became a symbol of resistance against institutionalised racism.

Amongst other things  I confirmed that in the House of Commons tomorrow  the SNP will vote against airstrikes on Syria; that the Scottish Government will protect the police budget through real terms increases for the Scottish Police Authority revenue budget next year and - if re-elected - for every year of the next Parliament; and that I will represent Scotland this weekend at the Paris climate change summit.

I was interviewed a little earlier today on BBC News  by Laura Kuenssberg about the vote tomorrow on whether Britain should take part in the bombing of Syria.   Sadly  there has been too much focus on process  whereas the debate should be about war and peace. Frankly  the Prime Minister has not made a convincing case for war  as I said in this interview:  “There are ordinary people in Raqqa  just like you and me  who don’t want to be bombed; there are refugees that have come out of Raqqa  who say  ‘please don’t bomb’; there are also question marks about the PM’s claim that there is an army of 75 000 people ready to join in support of these strikes - that argument seems to be unravelling as the hours go by.”	HER	video	74.31	64.77	19.82	25.77	44.00	15.15	3.03	3.03	0.00	2.27	0.76	2.27	0.76	2.27	1.52	0.76	2.27	0.00	1.52	0.00	0.76	0.00	3.03	0.76	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00

Ahead of today's vote on extending bombing to Syria  I wrote an article in the Mirror.   I summarised that  "We are in the fifteenth year of the War on Terror. The UK has taken part in wars in Afghanistan  Iraq and Libya.  Given the current terror threat it is obvious that these wars have not achieved their aims.  There is now a clear risk that extending UK bombing to Syria will threaten  rather than protect  our national security.  Only a negotiated settlement of the Syrian conflict  backed by all the main countries in the region will beat Isis.  Dropping more bombs without a proper plan risks spreading the war and playing into the hands of ISIS."

Today MPs are being asked to vote on the most difficult question of all - the question of war and peace.  Today I led the Labour Party's response to the Government's proposals. Here is part of my speech in the House of Commons  where I express my concern that David Cameron has not made a convincing case for extending airstrikes to Syria.   As I said to the Prime Minister  "Whether it’s the lack of a strategy worth the name the absence of credible ground troops the missing diplomatic plan for a Syrian settlement the failure to address the impact on the terrorist threat or the refugee crisis and civilian casualties: it’s become increasingly clear that the Prime Minister’s proposal for military action simply do not stack up."

Politics is about passion  values and principles.  I joined the Labour Party because of the beliefs it stood for and now as its leader I want us as a party to return to our collective Labour principles that our great party was founded on.  I want a great debate within the party  I want all our members to have the opportunity to help create the policies that will lead us to victory in 2020. With a party of over 380 000 members we will not always agree and I think that is healthy for our party democracy.  But democratic debate comes with responsibilities – the responsibility of respect for others  even if they don’t agree with you. Over recent days I have received a number of reports that there have been some incidents where Labour Party members and MPs have been abused. Unfortunately the Prime Minister took part in this himself by downgrading this debate by calling those who vote against extending airstrikes “terrorist sympathisers.”   I want to be very clear – there is no place in the Labour Party or from those that support us - for bullying of any sort  from any side of the debate. It flies in the face of everything I believe and everything I stand for.   Let us – all of us in the Labour Party - focus on building a party that can win in 2020. Let’s do that in a comradely fashion.  Let's turn out and together take the opposition to the Tories and deliver a Labour government the country so desperately needs; housing for all  a world class national health system  well-paid and high-skilled jobs – an equal and fair society.

Parliament has just voted to launch airstrikes in Syria. I am reminded of the messages I have received in recent days from my constituents who have expressed deep concern for family in Syria. I also think of our armed forces whose lives will be put in danger.   The fact of the matter is  David Cameron’s case was not convincing  lacking either credible ground troops or a plan for a diplomatic settlement. Since he first made his case for airstrikes in Syria  last Thursday  opposition has mounted; in the country  in parliament and in the Labour Party.   It is impossible to avoid the conclusion that the Prime Minister realised opposition to his ill thought-out rush to war was growing – and he needed to hold the vote before it slipped from his hands. I have argued  and will continue to do so  that we should re-double our efforts to secure a diplomatic and political end to the conflict in Syria.  British service men and women will now be in harm’s way and the loss of innocent lives is sadly almost inevitable.

I am delighted that Labour has not only won the Oldham West and Royton by-election – but increased our share of the vote since the general election in May.   Jim McMahon will make an excellent MP and a worthy successor to Michael Meacher  and I am looking forward to welcoming him to Labour’s team at Westminster.   Jim ran a great campaign  focusing on bringing jobs to Oldham and giving every child the best opportunities.   By-elections can be difficult for the party holding the seat  and turnouts often low. But to increase our share of the vote since the general election is a vote of confidence in our party.   It’s a clear demonstration that Labour is the party working people trust.   Our determination to oppose Tory austerity policies  and our successes in pushing them back on tax credit and police cuts show that Labour is getting results for working people.     With the Tories going nowhere in Oldham  UKIP has benefited from a protest vote. But this first electoral test in the new parliament has made clear Labour is the real alternative for Britain.

The gun control push illustrates the misguided priorities of President Obama and Hillary Clinton.

Today we learned that the female shooting suspect in California was apparently approved for a Visa from the Department of Homeland Security -- using a fake address on her application. If this does not cause an immediate stop to the President's Syrian Refugee Program  I am not sure what will. The fact is that ISIS has promised to try and infiltrate our country by attempting to disguise their members as refugees. This shooting not only confirms that ISIS's mission has been brought to our shore  but also confirms my greatest fear -- they have been able to get a radicalized Islamic terrorist through our vetting system.

We lived in a three and a half room rent-controlled apartment in Brooklyn  New York  but he worked hard  my mom worked hard  and they were able to create a situation where their two kids went to college.  Their story  my story  your story  our story is the story of America  hardworking families coming to the United States to create a brighter future for their kids. It is a story rooted in family and fueled by hope. It is a story that continues to this day in families all across the United States.

The President tonight continued his failure of leadership and his outrageous quest to turn a necessary discussion on terrorism and national security into an unnecessary and ineffective gun control debate.   Let's be clear:  disarming more law abiding citizens will not stop mass murderers and terrorists.  We should be advocating for more concealed carry ability for law abiding Americans and an end to unconstitutional gun free zones.     Second  we must fully examine and reform our border security  including refugee and visa programs.  While the President paid lip service to this fight  he plans to keep the failed current rules in place and allow tens of thousands of refugees to enter our country.   I couldn't disagree more strongly.  Immigration  visas and refugees from countries with active terror networks must have halted while we determine how to better secure our borders and our people.   Finally  we must stop doing the same foolish things overseas that the President advocated for throughout his remarks.     We must stop arming and training allies of ISIS and al Qaeda.  We should not double down on this failed and dangerous policy that the President called for tonight.   We must arm our allies the Kurds and insist on Arab boots on the ground for our allies in the region.   There are answers here to make our nation safe  but once again the President seems incapable of finding them.  His Administration is focused on gun laws that won't stop terrorists while pushing policies that will let more of them in the country.  It's 100 percent wrong and proves the need for new leadership for our country.

President Obama is right. ISIS will be destroyed with an international coalition in which Muslim troops on the ground are supported by the United States  United Kingdom  France  Russia and other leading powers.

Signed into law the indefinite detention of American citizens   6.  His copy of the bill of rights obviously goes from 1 to 3  skipping 2nd amendment.  7.  Court ruled his NSA spying on every American was illegal.  8.  He has added more debt than anyone in history.  9.

I'll tell you what does worry me. Ever since Trump has been opening his mouth  you're seeing all these bitter people  latent racists who are becoming emboldened. You're seeing some ugly stuff happening around this country.  What we have got to do immediately is to say that racism and xenophobia are totally unacceptable and we will stand with Muslims and undocumented people in this country. We can't allow racism and xenophobia to gain traction.

If you see Gladys walking down the street  go right ahead and throw her a high five. Of the 70 000 jobs created in Australia last month 50 000 were here in NSW. That's massive.   It means over 180 000 jobs have been created in NSW so far in 2015.   But there is no room for complacency. There is a big job ahead of us as we rebuild NSW... and we are just warming up.

My nightmare is that 20  30  40 years from now  our kids and our grandchildren will look members of Congress in the eye and they will say  "The scientists told you what would happen and you did nothing. Why did you not react? How hard was it to stand up to the fossil fuel industry and transform our energy system away from coal and oil into energy efficiency and wind  solar  geothermal and other sustainable energies?"   How irresponsible can we be to ignore what the entire scientific community is saying?

A year ago  in the face of evil  we saw a remarkable outpouring of love and compassion as flowers flooded Martin Place.  Today  we revealed the concept for the permanent memorial that will forever serve as a reminder of those we lost and the way this city came together in response.  In the face of division  we saw unity. In response to hate  we saw an overflow of peace and love.  We tragically lost Katrina and Tori. But we did not  and will not  lose the values that set us apart.  The memorial was designed by Richard Johnson and features hundreds of floral cubes inset into new granite paving right across Martin Place. At night they will illuminate to remind us that  when faced with darkness  this city responded with light.  The memorial also honours Katrina and Tori  who will live in our memories forever.   We will hold a twilight ceremony on Tuesday to mark the one-year anniversary of the siege. It will end with a lighting display on the Lindt Cafe  which will be repeated for five nights  and which movingly captures the spirit of this city one year go. It is also a reminder to the families of Katrina and Tori that we share in their grief and stand with them in their loss.

Its words resonate with me more than ever today. Here’s an excerpt.  ...... There's a fellow crying in Martin Place. They can't stop him.  The traffic in George Street is banked up for half a mile and drained of motion. The crowds are edgy with talk and more crowds come hurrying. Many run in the back streets which minutes ago were busy main streets  pointing There’s a fellow weeping down there. No one can stop him. ......  Today we weep  but also know that hope will triumph over hate.

I'm disgusted. There's no other word for it. Amidst the chaos of yesterday's GOP debate in Las Vegas  it was Congress that was quietly gambling away our future. Washington Republicans announced a massive bipartisan budget deal that preserves ObamaCare  funds Planned Parenthood  solidifies Obama's nuclear deal with Iran  and allows the White House to accept thousands of unvetted Syrian refugees.  Americans are sick and tired of the political theatre that passes for productivity in Washington. With billions in handouts to Hollywood and America's enemies  this $1.1 trillion deal adds billions of dollars to our $18.5 trillion national debt and continues our country on a path to ruin. What will it take for Washington politicians to wake-up  stand-up to Obama and put Americans first?

We’re legalising Uber.  The digital revolution is disrupting and transforming the way business is done right across the world  and the taxi industry is a prime example.  The thing that has made the taxi/ride-share situation difficult to manage is that  unlike other businesses facing disruption (say  video stores facing disruption from Netflix) the government has sold and regulated taxi licence plates and has a responsibility to offer some protection for the mums and dads and investors who own these plates.  At the same time  we believe in innovation and we want the best outcome for consumers.   The solution we have come to basically boils down to this:  * Ride-sharing services will become legal   * Taxi licence plate owners will benefit from an adjustment package funded through both government funding and a short term levy on ride-sharing  * We are getting rid of over 50 cumbersome regulations  * Safety will be boosted through a new regulator and commissioner to oversee the industry  We are helping consumers to win through having more choice in how they travel and simultaneously being fair to taxi owners as they transition into the future.

My dad came to this country at the age of 17 without any money. My mother had dreams to own a home of her own  a small home  rather than rent. My dad worked all of the time but he never made a lot of money  so there was always pressure in the family and constant bickering. When you're a kid  you pick up on that.

There aren't many topics that provoke more heated debate than road rules and cyclists.  Anytime this comes up on talkback radio some driver will call in and say something like “Cyclists are a law unto themselves. They break the road rules whenever it suits them. They are totally dangerous.”  And then a cyclist will call in and say “Drivers are lunatics who show no regard for our safety. They drive too closely to us and swerve at us. THEY are totally dangerous.”  Here’s what we want: cyclists to obey the road rules and drivers to not endanger cyclists.   So  today we announced new laws that will hopefully help both of these things to happen.  From March next year:  * Drivers must give cyclists at least 1 metre space when overtaking (and at least 1.5 metres if you are traveling faster than 60km/h). This is designed to make cycling much safer and it has been campaigned for by many cycling advocates. Failure to do this will attract a fine and loss of 2 demerit points.  * Cyclists must carry photo ID. (A photo of your ID on your phone is ok too.) We have rejected the idea of licenses for cyclists. But we do think it is reasonable that if police need to issue a fine  they can identify the person they are speaking with.  Fines for cyclists are increasing from $71 to $425 for offences including running red lights and not stopping at pedestrian crossings. This brings these fines into line with what drivers pay for breaking road rules and will be more easily enforced with the new identification laws. These rules are for the safety of cyclists and other road users.  I’m sure there will be heated debate about these new laws. What I hope is that we have struck the right balance in an effort to keep our roads safe. We want cyclists to be safe. We want them obeying the road rules. And we want drivers to be responsible when driving near cyclists.

I think – and I say this straightforwardly – I think Donald Trump is a pathological liar. I think much of what he says are lies or gross distortion of reality. And what somebody like a Donald Trump is doing is playing on the fears and anxieties of the American people. And people are afraid. But instead of having a rational discussion about how we rebuild the middle class  what Trump is saying is it's all the Muslims' fault  it's all the Mexicans' fault.

I wrote a Christmas message in The Mirror earlier this week.  ....We should always be asking ourselves – all of us  not just politicians – whether we could do more for others.  In this way  the Christmas story holds up a mirror to us all. “Do unto others as you would have done to you” – that is the essence of my socialism  summed up in the word ­“solidarity”.  The concept of solidarity is about our unity – we succeed or fail together. Yet too often there are attempts to divide us  to scapegoat  rather than help  those in need.  Jesus said: “It is more blessed to give than to receive”.  It is a similar maxim that inspired our party: “From each according to their means  to each according to their needs.”	HER	link	73.47	95.70	26.25	69.92	16.00	17.19	3.12	0.78	0.00	0.00	0.78	1.56	0.00	4.69	1.56	2.34	6.25	0.00	0.78	0.00	10.16	1.56	3.91	0.78	0.78	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00

I could have shut up about life and marriage. Big money donors wanted me to shut up  but I didn't. I lost their support but I didn’t lose my soul.  I don't wake up each morning and wonder which Mike Huckabee I am going to be. I don't have two sets of views depending on who I am speaking to.  I am staunchly pro-life and pro-marriage. As President  I am not going to leave these issues up to the states. I am going to fight for federal laws to end abortion and protect traditional marriage. I will end Planned Parenthood's federal funding as fast as I am going to tear down the IRS with the FairTax.  Comment below with "YES" if that’s the kind of President you want in office...

As millions of Australian families enjoy the school holidays  the Turnbull Liberals have today locked-in - beyond doubt - their $30 billion cut to schools.  Every student in every school will be worse off.  This shows that Malcolm Turnbull is every bit as bad as Tony Abbott when it comes to schools.  I want your kid to be given the same chance to succeed at school as any other kid in the country. Labor's policy is that school funding should go where it is most needed - to ensure the best education outcome for all Australian kids.

I am challenging the Prime Minister to an annual televised ‘state of the nation’ debate of the party leaders.   People are entitled to know more about their political leaders and to have their government held to account by the elected opposition in every way possible.  It is crucial that the Prime Minister and Government are held to account  both inside and outside Parliament  throughout their period in office – not just at election time.  Bringing politics to the people.

Bruce and I will be celebrating the New Year tonight with just the two of us  pretty much the same way we’ve done many times before: lots of good cheeses  champagne  and Casablanca.  The movie gets to me every time. It’s about love  loyalty  and courage. It's also about refugees. Casablanca was a stop along the route of people fleeing the terror of the Nazis. Young people on the threshold of building a new life  and old people hoping for a safe landing place. The movie was shot in early 1942 against a backdrop of Jews fleeing persecution and death  but the mix of people meeting in Casablanca speaks to the pain and vulnerability of all people forced to run from their homes in order to survive. Casablanca is about a very real threat to humanity  but also about how people survive  flourish and fight back.    The movie carries a double significance: it is a great story told about immigrants  but it is also a great story told by immigrants. Of the 75 or so actors with various parts in the movie  the overwhelming majority had immigrated to the US. Carl the waiter lost three sisters in a Nazi concentration camp  and the German banker who can’t get into the casino had fled the 1917 Russian revolution.  The movie is a creative triumph – much like America – made stronger because it is woven together by people who are not a single race or a single religion  stronger because we choose to come together to build a new country based on our talents and energy and shared values.    Each time I watch it  Casablanca gives me hope.      Happy New Year.

Tomorrow  rail fares are set to rise by an average of 1.1%.   Labour's shadow transport secretary  Lilian Greenwood explains that  “Passengers have faced truly staggering fare rises of up to £2 000 since 2010. In some cases  commuters are paying nearly forty per cent more as a direct consequence of decisions made by Ministers."  It's a scandal that fares are being increased every year to subsidise the profits of private companies and other countries' railway systems.  The Labour Party is now committed to a publicly owned railway as the best way to secure a fair deal for rail passengers and taxpayers  and long term investment for a modern railway system.

I was at King’s Cross station this morning with dozens of Labour and union activists. We spoke with passengers on the first working day since rail fare rises were implemented across the country.   Labour's shadow transport secretary  Lilian Greenwood  explained that the latest rise meant passengers have been hit by a “truly staggering” rise of up to £2 000 in cash terms since 2010.  As the Guardian covered  I said:  “If it goes on like this then people go back to road transport  we go back to greater congestion. The railways are a sustainable  good form of transport and they should be affordable for all.”  Corbyn said that the UK had the most expensive railways in Europe and pointed out that a number of British rail lines are run by companies that are owned by foreign governments.  “What we want is the train operating companies brought into public ownership as their franchises expire ” said Corbyn. “But in the meantime we want the Department for Transport to get hold of the fare structure so that commuting is affordable  so that railways are affordable.”	HER	link	92.28	79.50	45.55	56.93	22.75	23.63	1.65	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	1.10	1.10	2.20	1.10	1.10	1.10	0.55	2.20	0.00	2.75	1.10	2.75	1.10	0.55	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00

At Prime Minister’s Questions today  I asked David Cameron about the floods that have affected so many families and businesses across the country. He ignored my questions about specific flood defences that have not received the funding required  resulting in so much devastation.  I asked what lessons had been learnt from the floods we experienced just one year ago. I also asked why flood defences in Leeds were cancelled and why Cumbria County Council's application for funding for flood defence schemes for Keswick and Kendal were turned down.   I spoke to a couple in York whose house had been flooded  which was especially difficult for them to accept as a Government report had flagged up the insufficient capacity of flood pumps in their area only three years ago. Cameron avoided my question as the Government did nothing.    I went on to ask about the importance of the Fire & Rescue Service being given a statutory duty to deal with floods as they carry so much responsibility in the aftermath of floods but without adequate resources or recognition. And again  no response from Cameron.

In 2014  the Fed and FDIC reported that 11 of the big banks were still so risky that if any one of them started to fail  they’d need a government bailout or risk taking down the American economy – again. But today  the Republicans running for President claim they will repeal all the new financial regulations – hoping that they will be chosen as Wall Street’s favorite candidate. I’m glad Bernie Sanders is out there fighting to hold the big banks accountable  to make our economy safer  and to stop the Republicans from rigging the system even more in Wall Street's favor.

So let’s get this straight: CEO Hank Greenberg ran AIG as it recklessly gambled on mortgage-backed securities – and left just before his company took a $182 billion bailout from the Bush Administration. Once his Republican friends were out of office  Greenberg sued the Obama Administration because – get this – the bailout wasn’t generous enough for him. And now  Hank Greenberg is giving $10 million of his AIG fortune to try to save Jeb Bush’s dying Presidential campaign.    I’m not sure what’s more disgusting: That Jeb Bush is pinning his Presidential hopes on his brother’s bailout money  or that bailed-out CEOs are trying to buy elections.

This week we saw David Cameron avoid or misrepresent his government's record on flood defence spending.   The cuts to flood defences and the agencies that deal with floods is a choice this government has made based on their austerity agenda.  The cost caused by these floods is to run into billions of pounds. But  the National Audit Office estimates that for every £1 spent on flood defence  at least £8 is saved - showing that austerity is a political choice  not an economic necessity.

My thoughts and prayers are with the family of Green Beret Staff Sgt. Matthew McClintock  who gave his life for his country earlier this week in Afghanistan. We must remember that freedom is not free and that the reason we are able to enjoy the liberties we cherish is because of people like Matthew. There are hundreds of stories that need to be told of the bravery and sacrifices of our troops and I will do my best to share them with you all. Like that of so many of America's service members  Matthew's service will not be forgotten.  "Staff Sgt. Matthew McClintock  of Des Moines  Wash.  joined the Army in 2006 and served as a Special Forces engineer sergeant  the Washington National Guard said in a statement. McClintock deployed to Iraq in 2007 before being selected by the U.S. Army Special Forces School in May 2009  according to Army Times. He previously deployed to Afghanistan between August 2012 and May 2013 and left active duty for the guard in December 2014. His most recent deployment to Afghanistan  which began in July  was with the Washington Army National Guard’s Company A  1/19th Special Forces Group and began in July  the Guard said.   McClintock was killed by small-arms fire Tuesday during an hourslong battle in the Marjah district of Helmand province. Two other American troops and four Afghan soldiers were injured  military officials said. The coalition conducted 12 airstrikes in the area with a variety of aircraft  including F-16 fighter jets and an AC-130 gunship  said Col. Michael Lawhorn  spokesman for Resolute Support  the military coalition’s operation in Afghanistan."

Here's my article in this morning's Observer  where I talk about everything from the Tories undermining our democracy to Labour winning in 2020:  "Our democracy is being systematically undermined by David Cameron’s government. Having narrowly won the general election  the Tories are now trying to rig the political system to keep themselves in power and weaken the opposition  both inside and outside parliament. ... We will hold Cameron’s government to account: on its self-defeating austerity; its redistribution to the wealthiest; its deliberate stoking of house price inflation  which is fuelling the housing shortage; its threat to the NHS  social care and education; its attack on rights at work; its failure to invest in everything from flood defences and the arts to manufacturing and green infrastructure.  We have already shown that this government’s excesses can be curbed by a determined opposition. We defeated them on working tax credits  on cuts to the police service  and on their scandalous prison deal with Saudi Arabia.     Labour stands for social justice and prosperity for all. It exists to deliver the jobs  security  services and life chances denied to so many. That is what Labour is for. That’s why we are building the genuine democratic alternative that the Tories are so determined to stifle."

This morning I was interviewed on BBC's Today Programme about issues ranging from the sad news of David Bowie's death to Trident.   Nick Robinson's final question was  "how on earth can I persuade the country to back me?" I responded by saying:  "Well somewhere along the line I've managed to be re-elected 8 times in my constituency with very large majorities  when I started off with a very small majority. And I managed to receive the support of 250 000 members and supporters of the Party in the leadership election. I realise that's not the public  but I'd just say this:  If we carry on like this  in this country  we end up with a more divided Britain. We end up with more people sleeping homeless. We end up with more young people in overcrowded accommodation and underachieving at school. We have a housing strategy that denies opportunity for everybody - middle class families whose children can't leave because they can't afford to buy anywhere; poorer families can't get any Council housing and forced into very expensive private rented accommodation.   We can  will and must do things very differently  and I am very determined that that alternative will be there for everybody in this country."

Everybody in Britain recognises and is grateful for the hard work and long hours put in by junior doctors.  Their treatment by this government has been nothing short of appalling  leading to the strike action in our NHS today.   No NHS worker takes lightly the decision to strike  but the blame must be laid at the door of this government for the way it has treated doctors and now seeks to smear them in the press.

Great article by Labour's Shadow Health Minister  Justin Madders:  "Faced with this onslaught of attacks junior doctors decided enough is enough – and they voted overwhelmingly (98 per cent) in favour of industrial action. This is the first time in forty years that junior doctors have voted to take such significant action.  Speak to any junior doctor and they’ll tell you the last thing they want to be doing is withdrawing their labour  but the truth is they feel like Jeremy Hunt has backed them into a corner and left them with no other way to get their message across. ... The priority now must be to find a negotiated solution – and for that to happen Jeremy Hunt needs to acknowledge just how damaging his approach has been and for him to rebuild trust with the very people who we all rely on to keep the NHS going.  Sadly for patients affected by today’s action that will be too little  too late. But the message to those patients should be clear – don’t blame junior doctors  blame Jeremy Hunt."

Not only can we effectively combat climate change  we can create good paying jobs.

My response to President Obama's State of the Union address:  President Obama took a victory lap tonight even though he has little to celebrate. The failures of the past seven years are apparent to ordinary Americans across the country  but the President continues to engage in denial and self-congratulation.   The President says that “anyone claiming America’s economy is in decline is peddling fiction.” In reality  anyone claiming a rosy picture of economy recovery is peddling fiction.  Nearly eight years after the Great Recession  some 14% of Americans remain underemployed in the Obama economy.  Our labor participation rate is at its lowest point in 40 years  and nearly 40% of Americans are not even looking for work.  The President says focusing on the threat of the Islamic State is over the top; yet  the savagery of terrorism as exhibited from Umpqua Community College in Oregon to Chattanooga to Paris tells us that the only thing over the top is Obama’s nonchalant disposition regarding the threat of radical Islamic extremism. While he lectures Americans about strengthening our defenses against homegrown terrorism  he cannot even identify the threat of Islamic extremism by name.  The President says that if Congress is serious about winning the war against the Islamic State  it needs to authorize the use of military force against the terrorists. In reality  if the President is serious about winning this war  he needs to come up with a strategy for defeating and destroying the Islamic State. Thus far  he has only come up with empty promises and movable redlines.  The President talks about helping Ukraine defend its democracy. Yet  he has repeatedly refused to provide lethal assistance to Ukraine to defend itself against Russian aggression.  Unfortunately  after seven years  the only countries with which the United States has improved relations are Iran and Cuba. By contrast  I have a foreign policy plan for restoring America’s global leadership in the world.  The President assures us that America’s military isn’t losing its global strength. In reality  thanks to draconian defense cuts imposed by the Obama administration  our armed forces are currently too small  too old  outgunned and under-resourced. Additionally  no one is calling the United States for global leadership right now – the world has seen seven years of a President unwilling to take a stand  and willing to unilaterally disarm the world's greatest military.   The President talks about protecting Medicare. In fact  Obamacare has done vast damage to our entire health care system. I have a plan for repealing and replacing Obamacare that is centered on expanding choice  creating health empowerment accounts for every citizen and restoration of the doctor-patient relationship. The President asks how we can give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in the new economy. His solution has been to crush entrepreneurs  small businesses and middle-class families with vast regulations and higher taxes.  I have a different solution: a flat tax of 14.9% applied to income—only once. I know something about having a long shot to success  and I know that shared prosperity in this country will materialize when the government gets out of the way of the talents and ingenuity of the American people.  The President takes credit for the energy revolution that has drastically cut our oil imports. In reality  he can take zero credit for the country’s fracking boom. His achievement has been funneling money to special interests and political cronyism  and failed government funded ventures such as Solyndra.  The President ended his speech by saying he is as confident as he’s ever been about the state of the union. Unfortunately  voters across the country do not share that enthusiasm. In their opinion  the state of the union is not strong.

This morning I laid out how Labour can build a fairer Britain by institutionalising fairness. I was speaking at the Fabian Society's New Year Conference - Facing the Future.   Sky News aired most of what I said and the text below is the whole speech:  "The absence of fairness and the wish for more of it is what drives us into political activity. We want a fair treatment for all  a fairer society and a fairer world.  Fairness is easily to claim  but hard to deliver. David Cameron makes the argument that cuts are fair because it is not fair to burden future generations with debt.  Superficially  a very compelling argument but how is cutting investment in  and opportunities for  tomorrow’s generation fair? It’s not. It’s deeply unfair.  And today’s young people are already paying the price:  The maintenance grant is being abolished - John McDonnell recently joined a demo against that - and nurses’ bursaries are being cut - Heidi Alexander joined the demo about that last week - housing is becoming less affordable whether as a renter or a buyer.  David Cameron is burdening today’s young adults with more debt than ever. Shackling them with a lifelong fetter on their ability to live independently  to rent or buy their own home  to start a family.  They don’t believe it’s fair but many people believe the economic crash means cuts have to be made. Not fair  but necessary.  That is our failure. Our failure to offer a convincing alternative to people who already agreed with us that it isn’t fair. How was it that we couldn’t make a convincing case that fairness was necessary?  Investing in our future  investment in new infrastructure  industries and jobs is guaranteeing fairness. Investing in housing  new railways  new digital infrastructure creates jobs  creates a social and economic return. Cutting investment  as this government has done  cuts opportunity and cuts fairness.  Fairness isn’t just an abstract morality that we claim; it is something we together – as Labour – have delivered over decades in Britain.  Labour governments only became possible when everyone had the vote; men and women  working class as well as the propertied classes. It was the labour movement  the trade unions  the Suffragettes and our Party that campaigned for that to happen.  Universal suffrage is inherently fair and we used its electoral force to create a fairer Britain.  Like Tony Benn said “Democracy transferred power from the wallet to the ballot. What people couldn’t afford for themselves  they could vote for instead.”  We are the party that created the institutions that built a fairer and more equal Britain: we founded the NHS established the safety net of social security we implemented comprehensive education we built council housing we created the Open University we instituted the Human Rights Act and the Equalities Act and the minimum wage.  And we are the party founded by trade unions – the organisations that deliver fairness in the workplace. Anyone can wrap their policies in the language of ‘fairness’  it is only Labour that has delivered fairness through institutions and laws.  Today the Britain built by Labour fairness is under attack and we have to find new ways to institutionalise fairness in British society again.  Now  the very basis on which those victories were secured – the vote – is under attack.   Having narrowly won the general election  the Tories are now trying to rig the system to keep themselves in power  and weaken opposition both inside and outside parliament.  Late last year they drove through a new voter registration scheme that will slash the number of young and inner-city voters. And later this Parliament they will cut the number of parliamentary seats. The Conservatives are gerrymandering the electoral system to benefit themselves.  By directly attacking Labour’s funding through their trade union bill and by cutting public Short money support for opposition parties’ research  they are deliberately setting out to constrain democratic accountability.  Add to that their “gagging law”  which prevents charities  unions and think-tanks from taking part in political debate near election time.  Their threats to use the BBC’s charter renewal to hack away at its independence;  Their packing of the House of Lords with Tory peers; their moves to restrict the powers of local councils  it all adds up to a serious attack on democratic rights and freedoms.  Theirs is the party funded by hedge funds backed by a press owned by multi-millionaire or even billionaire tax avoiders  Their concept of fairness is of a very different order to ours. Fairness for only a few is not fairness  but privilege.  Hidden among the fake concern for ‘balancing the books’  is the same hoary old Tory ideology – to shrink the state  to shrink fairness.  Look at the floods – flood defence schemes up and down the country cut back because of a political ideology that says the state must be shrunk.  I saw the consequences of that. I met the families who had lost their personal possessions: their photos  children’s toys  family pets – in homes that now have the foul stench of sewage-polluted floodwater.  I met too with the councils who told us about flood defence schemes cancelled or left unfunded. I met with Environment Agency staff who complained about the cuts to their staffing. I met with Fire & Rescue Service personnel whose numbers have been cut and who still don’t have the statutory responsibility for floods that would mean they had the equipment and kit to better respond.  Just because the Tories are running the state into the ground  don’t think it’s our public services that are the problem.  This is the same Tory strategy – they did it with the railways – underfund it  make cuts  run the service down  then offer up privatisation as the solution. Cynical dishonest and unfair.  It’s not just public services though they see only a limited role for the state because they want fairness limited too.  Their laissez-faire attitude to the steel industry could let a downturn become a death spiral in that sector. While other governments across Europe acted to protect their industry  the Tories let ours close  let jobs go  let communities suffer.  That is not the Labour way I’ve raised the issue with the Prime Minister  discussed it with the Chinese President and Chinese ministers and diplomats Labour brought together industry  unions  MPs and communities to try to find a solution.  I visited people in Scunthorpe they are proud of being a steel town  want to work and know how vital that industry is to their town’s prosperity.  Look across Europe and the support was there – in some cases they took their plants into public ownership to protect vital industry they offered schemes to help with energy costs and they have an industrial strategy and procurement strategies. They don’t let whole regions sink into decline.  Across Europe too – other countries’ investment in renewable energy leaves Britain languishing as one of the dirtiest  most polluting countries on this continent. This government is failing to invest in our future energy sources – its reckless negligence has seen the UK solar industry diminished.  But what is even more unfair is the inheritance it leaves our children – a polluted environment and a country without long-term energy security. That too is not the Labour way.  We are determined to build alliances across Europe for progressive reform to ensure the EU always works in people’s interests.  Labour backs Britain’s continued EU membership as the best framework for trade and co-operation in the 21st-century along with the protection of human rights through the European Convention.  But we need to make EU decision-making more accountable to its people put jobs and growth at the heart of European policy strengthen workers’ rights in a real social Europe  and end the pressure to privatise services.  Most of all  we want a Europe of solidarity that works together to address climate change that doesn’t pull the drawbridge up on free movement that acts together to tackle the refugee crisis  and the causes of refugees – and deals with disgraceful situation in Calais.  That’s the Europe that is possible and that Labour must work to deliver. I met last month with our sister parties to start to build those working relationships.  A fairer society – whether in Europe or in Britain – can only be built by working together and by enshrining fairness through institutions and laws.  This is about transforming our principles into practical policies – what Labour has always done when it has been successful.  It is guided by this practical fairness that Labour must move forward together.  I want to set out some of the ideas under discussion – policies to institutionalise fairness in Britain again: We are committed to a publicly owned railway  to bring down fares and to get investment in a modern railway – which would be governed not remotely from Whitehall  but by passengers  rail workers and politicians (local and national).  To democratic control of energy  not as an end in itself  but to bring down costs and to transition to carbon-free energy. Do you know half of German energy suppliers are owned by local authorities  communities and small businesses? There are now over 180 German towns and cities taking over their local electricity grids  selling themselves cleaner (and cheaper) electricity they increasingly produce for themselves That is something we as Labour should want to emulate – and the most innovative Labour councils are starting to do so.  To integrate health and social care recognising that if you cut social care – as this government has done – then that has a negative impact on the NHS with fewer beds available and longer waits at A&E. If we fund prevention fairly through an integrated strategy  we can save money in the long run without undermining fairness.  Creating a lifelong education service  so that opportunity is available to all throughout our lives recognising that in the modern era we need to be able to re-train and re-skill our workforce as technology evolves  and industries change. Again this is in sharp contrast to this government’s unfair slashing of college funding and the adult education budget.  Universal childcare – so that we build on the great Labour legacy of Sure Start and the 15 hours free childcare that has supported so many young parents into work and provided high quality childcare so that all children have the best start in life.  In workplaces too we must ensure that fairness is hardwired the scandal of Sports Direct has shocked people. So as well as repealing the Tory Trade Union Act when it becomes law  we need a set of rights for all workers from day one to stop exploitation. It was Beatrice Webb who coined the term ‘collective bargaining’ – recognising that together we bargain  alone we beg.  But we need to go beyond that and ensure that everyone benefits when companies succeed. One proposal is pay ratios between top and bottom so that the rewards don’t just accrue to those at the top of the G7 nations only the US has greater income inequality than the UK pay inequality on this scale is neither necessary nor inevitable.  Another proposal would be to bar or restrict companies from distributing dividends until they pay all their workers the living wage. Only profitable employers will be paying dividends  if they depend on cheap labour for those profits then I think there is a question over whether that is a business model to which we should be turning a blind eye.  Too much of the proceeds of growth have accumulated to those at the top. Not only is this unfair  it actually holds back growth – as OECD research has found. A more equal society is not only fairer  it does better in terms of economic stability and wealth creation.  And a large-scale house-building programme – recognising the housing crisis that has been so recklessly exacerbated by this government we need homes that are for families not for investment portfolios. Our country cannot succeed unless everyone can live together in our towns and cities – the cleaner and the city trader the carer and the chief executive a new generation of council housing delivered by councils able to borrow prudentially.  These are all only suggestions. You – Labour Party members  affiliates and supporters – in this Hall and beyond. You will decide what our policies are policy made by small cliques in small rooms often only brings small returns.  The passion to change things  to make things better  is what drives us all. Labour needs to hear from all those fired by that passion.  Ed Miliband expanded the vote to elect the Leader – empowering members and supporters. I want to do the same with our policy-making. We all have ideas; we all have a vision for a fairer Britain and a fairer world. Labour will be stronger and more in touch with our communities when it hears from its greatest strength our members  supporters and affiliates.  Our party is changing our membership has doubled since that defeat in May our party is in a process of regenerating – a difficult process of adjustment for us all at times – but a huge opportunity to breathe life into all sections of the party and draw on the collective wisdom of all.  Only Labour can offer a vision of a fairer Britain. Let’s work together to create and deliver that fairer Britain.  Thank you."

There are no excuses. The governor long ago knew about the lead in Flint’s water. He did nothing. As a result  hundreds of children were poisoned. Thousands may have been exposed to potential brain damage from lead. Gov. Snyder should resign.  Because of the conduct by Gov. Snyder’s administration and his refusal to take responsibility  families will suffer from lead poisoning for the rest of their lives. Children in Flint will be plagued with brain damage and other health problems. The people of Flint deserve more than an apology.

It’s time to join every other major nation and guarantee health care to all as a right  not a privilege. That's why my #MedicareForAll plan provides health care to ALL Americans  including the 50 million uninsured or Underinsured—the only plan that does that.  Medicare for All means no more copays  no more deductibles and no more fighting with insurance companies when they fail to pay for charges. Which means a family making $50 000 would save $5 807 a year under my #MedicareForAll plan.

She went to my high school and was part of the high school soccer team that won the state soccer championship. She was the captain of the Wayzata High School hockey team. She graduated from the Air Force Academy  and while she was there  she led the Air Force team to victory in the National Championship as co-captain of the team her senior year. She served in the Air Force since 2002  all the while taking on increasingly important assignments. Jacob will always know his mom as a hero  and he will forever be surrounded by loving family members who knew her well. As noted at the funeral  Adrianna "gave her life for the country she loved."

At Prime Minister's Questions today  I asked David Cameron about his plans to abolish maintenance grants and remove bursaries from student nurses.   500 000 students are currently entitled to maintenance grants  which act as a lifeline for students from less well-off backgrounds.  In the last parliament  Cameron trebled tuition fees to £9 000 per year and these latest proposals will only worsen the financial situation for students leaving university and trying to start a career.   The Tories have no mandate to abolish maintenance grants or nurses' bursaries - neither proposal was in their manifesto.   Here  I asked Cameron a question from Liam  a student who wishes to be a maths teacher  who raised concerns that he'll be saddled with more than £50 000 of debt after he graduates.    David Cameron replied  "what I'd say to Liam  and I wish him well  is that he will not pay back a penny of his loan until he is earning £21 000."   The Prime Minister wishing Liam well is of little help and as I pointed out  Liam says his salary as a teacher will be £25 000 so he'll be paying back this debt from day one of his new career.

At Prime Minister Questions  I asked David Cameron why he is planning to remove bursaries from student nurses. His own MP  Maria Caulfield  said "I would have struggled to undertake my nurse training given the proposed changes to the bursary scheme."  This amounts to an effective pay cut of over £900 for the average nurse  and the Tories did not include this in their manifesto – just like they didn’t include the proposal to remove maintenance grants for students from less well-off backgrounds.   David Cameron said to me that  “we’re going to see 10 000 extra nurse degree places because of this policy.” The Royal College of Nurses have said they have “significant concerns” with this claim and has said “there is no certainty that the changes will increase nursing supply.”   This is supported by a UNISON survey which showed that 91% of student nurses would not have applied for their nursing degree without access to the bursary which the government intends to scrap in 2017.  We should be supporting those who want to serve their community by working for our National Health Service. Our nurses need bursaries and we need our nurses.

Last week  I responded to a question from Stylist magazine about my "object of desire." I said it was an aluminium-framed Raleigh Criterium bicycle.  I could not have imagined when I replied that a crowdfunder would be set up to buy me this bike. People’s generosity has been remarkable and incredibly the total raised is over £6 000. The average donation was £2.70.   I’d like to say a huge thanks to every person that has donated. It’s truly humbling and I’m pleased that others will now benefit from this – as the organisers have suggested that they donate the substantial excess money raised to a charity of their choice. I will also be donating the cost of the bike to charity.

Today I went to the Grande-Synthe refugee camp  near Dunkirk  and the emergency refugee camp in Calais  in northern France.  The plight of thousands of refugees in Calais and Dunkirk  destitute and forced to live in inhuman conditions  is an affront to our common humanity which demands action by both France and Britain.   We must reach out the hand of humanity to the victims of war and brutal repression. Along with other EU states  Britain needs to accept its share of refugees from the conflicts on Europe’s borders  including the horrific civil war in Syria.   We have to do more. As a matter of urgency  David Cameron should act to give refuge to unaccompanied refugee children now in Europe – as we did with Jewish Kindertransport children escaping from Nazi tyranny in the 1930s.   And the government must provide the resources needed for those areas accepting refugees – including in housing and education - rather than dumping them in some of Britain’s poorest communities.

RENOMINATION FOR WARRINGAH  After leaving the prime ministership  I said that I would spend some time talking to family  trusted colleagues and local Liberals about my future. I have been heartened by the support and encouragement I’ve received to continue to serve the country as a member of parliament.    Therefore  I am renominating to represent the people of Warringah for another term as their Liberal MP.  I am proud of my work to establish the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust that has done so much to improve the amenity of former military land on North Head  Middle Head and Georges Heights. Should I be renominated and elected  I am looking forward to working with Premier Mike Baird to ensure that the Warringah Peninsula gets better transport links to the rest of Sydney.  It has been a great honour to serve the people of Warringah for 22 years and I hope to retain their trust and confidence.  http://tonyabbott.com.au/2016/01/renomination-for-warringah/	HER	link	90.15	57.22	28.41	99.00	23.57	26.06	7.27	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.61	0.61	1.82	1.21	0.61	0.00	0.61	0.61	0.00	2.42	4.24	3.03	2.42	1.82	0.00	0.61	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00

TRUMP CAMPAIGN STATEMENT ON FOX NEWS DEBATE  (New York  NY) January 26th  2016 - As someone who wrote one of the best-selling business books of all time  The Art of the Deal  who has built an incredible company  including some of the most valuable and iconic assets in the world  and as someone who has a personal net worth of many billions of dollars  Mr. Trump knows a bad deal when he sees one. FOX News is making tens of millions of dollars on debates  and setting ratings records (the highest in history)  where as in previous years they were low-rated afterthoughts.   Unlike the very stupid  highly incompetent people running our country into the ground  Mr. Trump knows when to walk away. Roger Ailes and FOX News think they can toy with him  but Mr. Trump doesn’t play games. There have already been six debates  and according to all online debate polls including Drudge  Slate  Time Magazine  and many others  Mr. Trump has won all of them  in particular the last one. Whereas he has always been a job creator and not a debater  he nevertheless truly enjoys the debating process - and it has been very good for him  both in polls and popularity.   He will not be participating in the FOX News debate and will instead host an event in Iowa to raise money for the Veterans and Wounded Warriors  who have been treated so horribly by our all talk  no action politicians. Like running for office as an extremely successful person  this takes guts and it is the kind mentality our country needs in order to Make America Great Again.

Last Thursday  I had minor surgery to take a small melanoma off my cheek. This photo was taken right after the operation.  I was very fortunate to find the melanoma while it was still extremely small  but as you can see  the cut was still several inches because they wanted to make sure they had gotten all of the cancer. We will know more when the lab results come back in a week or so  but I wanted to share my experience with you to highlight the importance of healthy skin care and the dangers of skin cancer and to urge you to see your dermatologist regularly and take care of your skin. http://bit.ly/1ZTQSsX	HER	photo	66.83	72.34	51.24	85.20	23.60	15.25	5.08	1.69	0.00	0.00	0.00	1.69	2.54	1.69	0.85	2.54	2.54	2.54	0.00	2.54	1.69	0.85	2.54	3.39	0.85	0.00	0.85	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00

It is with great sadness that I learned this morning of the passing of legendary broadcaster Terry Wogan.  Terry's humour and wit were unparalleled and he graced the top of his broadcasting profession for decades as a reassuring voice on the BBC.  As an Irishman  Terry Wogan occupied a special place in British listeners' hearts and he acted in no small way as a bridge between Ireland and Britain.  His always entertaining  and often unforgiving  commentary of the Eurovision Song Contest provided viewers here and in Britain with endless entertainment.  He was truly one of Limerick's finest sons.  Our deepest condolences go to his family at this time.

When you were a kid  did you ever dream of having an invisible cloak?  Well  it turns out  it is not all it's cracked up to be.   Most days  as I walk in my suit down Martin Place  I am often warmly greeted by the good people of Sydney. "Good Morning  Premier!" (Along with some “constructive feedback” of course.)  Some stop to ask for selfies. No problem  there. I'm a politician. I'm not averse to selfies.  But today in Martin Place  there are very few greetings. In fact  most people lower their heads and hurry past me  desperate to avoid eye contact.   Today  instead of wearing my suit  I'm in a high vis yellow vest and red cap  selling The Big Issue.   The Big Issue isn't just a magazine... It's a great social enterprise designed to help our homeless and disadvantaged get back on their feet by doing some work.   One morning a year  for the past 6 years  I've hit the streets to try my hand at selling the magazine... and I'm struck every year by the same confronting reality of suddenly becoming invisible.   It isn't fun being invisible. In fact  it is really lonely.   I don't write this to make you feel bad. I've done it all too often myself. I've lowered my head instead of greeting my fellow humans with a smile. I've been too busy to stop. I've felt embarrassed. I’ve felt inconvenienced. Even annoyed.  Today is a reminder for me to slow down a little. To have time for everyone  regardless of their attire or status. And it's a reminder that our homeless shouldn't be invisible.   We’re spending a record $182 million this year on specialist homelessness services and are expecting to assist 54 000 people. We have a long way to go. But I'm determined to make a difference in the lives of our most vulnerable.   Thanks to the 11 people who stopped today to buy a copy of The Big Issue. And thanks also to those who just stopped to smile and say hello... Scotty  my mate who sells the Big Issue every week  really appreciates it.   He's a really good bloke who  along with many others  is trying to have a crack at getting back on his feet.  And he shouldn't be invisible.

Dear loyal friends and supporters:  We live in the greatest country on earth and I ran for President because I wanted to make it better for my 5 grandkids.  I have no regrets about the effort because it’s never our responsibility to determine the results  but to be faithful to the task before us.  I have suspended my campaign  but not my desire to see America protect all human life  reward those who work hard  and give our veterans and seniors what they have paid the price to earn.    I am blessed with an incredibly supportive wife and family who never wavered in their confidence in me.  Our campaign staff was amazing—they gave it their all with competence  compassion  and a spirit of teamwork that I will forever cherish.  Our effort didn’t fall short due to lack of effort and expertise from our team.  And our volunteers every day were stunning and beyond belief in their efforts.  On days when I was exhausted and getting hammered by polls  idiotic media questions  or long car rides  I would read a post on FB from one of our supporters or get a letter from a donor that gave me fresh energy and determination.    While I truly wish the results were different  I would rather lose with honor than win without it.  Thank you so much for your prayers  your sacrifices of time and money  and your tireless efforts for our campaign.  Rumors abound that I’m getting ready to endorse someone  but those rumors are totally untrue.  While I may eventually support one of the candidates  right now I have a lot of things to do in wrapping up the loose ends of the campaign  trying to figure out my next chapter of life  and spending some time with my dogs who probably wonder if I had abandoned them.  (I haven’t!)  I love you guys  and want to stay in touch.  I am eternally grateful for you!

Does Bernie Sanders really believe that "democratic socialism" makes sense? Perhaps only he knows the answer to that. But socialism (or near socialism) in practice has been an economic disaster wherever it’s been seriously tried. And don’t believe for a minute that it’s a lack of "democracy" that has doomed socialism. No way! Since it's unlikely that Sanders truly believes in government owning the means of production  he's really not much different ideologically than other Democrats. He's just selling the same ideas in a different wrapper.

Let’s start with a statistic about Sydney’s nightlife that matters: alcohol related assaults have decreased by 42.2 per cent in the CBD since we introduced the “lock-out laws”.   And they’re down by over 60 per cent in Kings Cross.    But… didn’t we achieve this by shutting down the whole city and killing its nightlife?   Well  one last statistic: the number of small bars in Sydney has more than doubled in the same time period.   There has been a growing hysteria this week about nightlife in Sydney.   The main complaints seem to be that you can’t drink till dawn any more and you can’t impulse-buy a bottle of white after 10pm.    I understand that this presents an inconvenience. Some say this makes us an international embarrassment.   Except  assaults are down by 42.2 per cent.  And there is nothing embarrassing about that.   From the outset  these laws have been about fixing a serious problem. Violence had spiralled out of control  people were literally being punched to death in the city  and there were city streets too dangerous to stroll down on a Friday night. The community was rightly outraged. I was personally outraged. I met face to face with the families of victims. You don’t need to see that sort of pain too often to realise there is a problem that needs fixing. And the Government was determined to act.    We introduced laws to curb violence and to eliminate drinking ghettos by redistributing the nightlife across the city  making the whole city more vibrant.    Now  some have suggested these laws are really about moralising. They are right. These laws are about the moral obligation we have to protect innocent people from drunken violence.   Doctors right across the city are now telling us that they are seeing far less emergency room presentations on the weekends. Transport workers are telling us that the trains are safer. Small bars and restaurants are opening across Sydney. And residents across the city  particularly women  are telling us they feel safer walking home at night.    At this stage  some of the evidence is anecdotal. But lots of hard data is starting to come in. And it is all telling a similar story.   Over the coming months a detailed review into the effects of the lock-out laws will be undertaken. I await this work with interest. But as I’ve said before  it is going to take a lot for me to change my mind on a policy that is so clearly improving this city.  Now some  who wish to define our city by one street on Kings Cross  make the hysterical claim that Sydney is dead.  They couldn't be more wrong. This is the greatest city in the world and it is now safer and more vibrant than ever.   Long Live Sydney.

One of the most talked-about commercials of the Super Bowl was the Doritos ad showing a very pregnant woman getting a sonogram.  Her husband discovers that as he waves his Dorito over her stomach  the baby in the womb tries to reach for it.  The wife finally gets so annoyed  she grabs the Dorito and throws it  at which point the baby takes off  rushing to get born so it can go after that Dorito.  Yes  it’s a very silly commercial.  But not half as silly as the controversy it’s set off.  The abortion rights group NARAL is slamming the makers of Doritos for using the “anti-choice tactic” of “humanizing fetuses.”  News flash  NARAL:  fetuses ARE human.  We know because if they were dolphins  you probably wouldn’t be so quick to kill them.

I ran for president with the message that the government needs to once again work for the people  not the people work for the government. And while running for president I tried to reinforce what I have always believed - that speaking your mind matters  that experience matters  that competence matters and that it will always matter in leading our nation. That message was heard by and stood for by a lot of people  but just not enough and that’s ok. I have both won elections that I was supposed to lose and I’ve lost elections I was supposed to win and what that means is you never know what will happen.  That is both the magic and the mystery of politics - you never quite know when which is going to happen  even when you think you do. And so today  I leave the race without an ounce of regret.  I’m so proud of the campaign we ran  the people that ran it with me and all those who gave us their support and confidence along the way.  Mary Pat and I thank you for the extraordinary display of loyalty  friendship  understanding and love.

I've just released this statement in response to Jeremy Hunt’s announcement that he will impose a contract on junior doctors:  Jeremy Hunt's decision to impose a contract on junior doctors is provocative and damaging. Rather than helping to resolve this difficult dispute  his action will only inflame it.  The BMA has continued to table proposals to settle the dispute. The fact that the Health Secretary is now simply trying to impose his will rather than negotiate  demonstrates a lack of confidence in his own arguments.  We need to recognise the huge contribution junior doctors make and the years of training they go through to look after us. These are people dedicated to our health and our NHS.   Patients  doctors  the BMA and the public want an agreed settlement. What is now keeping this dispute going are the actions of the Secretary of State himself.  More strikes now look likely. If that happens  it will be clear that the blame lies with the government  not the doctors.  Even at this late stage  I appeal to Jeremy Hunt to go back and negotiate with the BMA.  This government is reckless with our NHS and is now prepared to put patient care at risk in the service of its self-defeating austerity programme.

RESPONSE TO THE LIES OF SENATOR CRUZ:   Ted Cruz is a totally unstable individual. He is the single biggest liar I’ve ever come across  in politics or otherwise  and I have seen some of the best of them. His statements are totally untrue and completely outrageous. It is hard to believe a person who proclaims to be a Christian could be so dishonest and lie so much.   Cruz said I would be appointing a liberal judge when in fact I will appoint a great conservative and I am the only candidate who has gone so far  at the debate  as to suggest two individuals I feel would best represent the conservative values we need to protect: William “Bill” Pryor Jr. and Diane Sykes.   Cruz says I am pro-choice  when in fact I am staunchly pro-life and have been for a long time. Like Ronald Reagan  on many issues  I have evolved.   Cruz says I am in favor of ObamaCare  when in fact I have spoken about repealing and replacing this disaster of a system at every speech throughout my campaign and since it’s inception. Meanwhile  Cruz was responsible for getting Bush to put in the judge that failed to vote against ObamaCare twice.   Cruz says I will try to take away your second amendment rights  when I am one of the strongest proponents of the right to bear arms and I say so in every speech that I have made for years. I am a proud member of the NRA and so are my sons.   Cruz has become unhinged and is lying with the hopes that his statements will go unchecked until after the election and he will save his failing campaign.   In Iowa  Cruz told thousands of Ben Carson voters that Dr. Carson had left the race and to instead vote for Ted Cruz. He apologized when the race was over. Likewise  his fraudulent voter violation form sent to Iowa voters. If Ted is going to continue to lie with such desperation  I have no choice but to fight back.   One of the ways I can fight back is to bring a lawsuit against him relative to the fact that he was born in Canada and therefore cannot be President. If he doesn’t take down his false ads and retract his lies  I will do so immediately. Additionally  the RNC should intervene and if they don’t they are in default of their pledge to me.   I am the strongest on the borders and I will build a wall  and it will be a real wall. I am strongest on illegal immigration  strongest on ISIS  strongest on the military and I will take care of our Vets. I will end common core and preserve the second amendment. I will renegotiate our trade deals and bring our jobs back to our country. I am the only person who will Make America Great Again.

Let me be clear—I am pro-life. I support that position with exceptions allowed for rape  incest or the life of the mother being at risk. I did not always hold this position  but I had a significant personal experience that brought the precious gift of life into perspective for me. My story is well documented  so I will not retell it here. However  what I will do with the remaining space is express my feelings about life  and the culture of life  as we approach the 43nd anniversary of the Roe v. Wade.  I build things. There is a process involved in building things. We tap into a lot of disciplines with engineering being one of the most important. The rules for putting structures together are as strict as are the rules of physics. These rules have stood the test of time and have become the path to putting together structures that endure and are beautiful. America  when it is at its best  follows a set of rules that have worked since our founding. One of those rules is that we  as Americans  revere life and have done so since our Founders made it the first  and most important  of our “unalienable” rights.  Over time  our culture of life in this country has started sliding toward a culture of death. Perhaps the most significant piece of evidence to support this assertion is that since Roe v. Wade was decided by the Supreme Count 43 years ago over 50 million Americans never had the chance to enjoy the opportunities offered by this country. They never had the chance to become doctors  musicians  farmers  teachers  husbands  fathers  sons or daughters. They never had the chance to enrich the culture of this nation or to bring their skills  lives  loves or passions into the fabric of country. They are missing  and they are missed.  The Supreme Court in 1973 based their decision on imagining rights and liberties in the Constitution that are nowhere to be found. Even if we take the court at its word  that abortion is a matter of privacy  we should then extend the argument to the logical conclusion that private funds  then  should subsidize this choice rather than the half billion dollars given to abortion providers every year by Congress. Public funding of abortion providers is an insult to people of conscience at the least and an affront to good governance at best.  If using taxpayer money to facilitate our slide to a culture of death was not enough  the 1973 decision became a landmark decision demonstrating the utter contempt the court had for federalism and the 10th Amendment. Roe v. Wade gave the court an excuse to dismantle the decisions of state legislatures and the votes of the people. This is a pattern that the court has repeated over and over again since that decision. Perhaps Roe v. Wade became yet another incidence of disconnect between the people and their government.  We are in the middle of a presidential political cycle and votes will be cast in just days. The citizens of this nation will have the chance to vote for candidates that are aligned with their individual worldviews. It is my hope that they will choose the builder  the man who has the ability to imagine the greatness of this nation. The next President must follow those principles that work best and that reinforce the reverence Americans hold for life. A culture of life is too important to let slip away for convenience or political correctness. It is by preserving our culture of life that we will Make America Great Again.

As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  I believe we have a constitutional duty to fill the vacancy left after Justice Antonin Scalia's death  and I look forward to helping get a nominee confirmed. A Supreme Court seat hasn't been open for longer than a year for over a century. The longest time any current justice took to be confirmed was 99 days  and 14 justices have been confirmed during election years. The Constitution says that the President "shall" nominate Supreme Court justices with the advice and consent of the Senate. We need to do our jobs.

In response to the Pope:  If and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS  which as everyone knows is ISIS’s ultimate trophy  I can promise you that the Pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been President because this would not have happened. ISIS would have been eradicated unlike what is happening now with our all talk  no action politicians.   The Mexican government and its leadership has made many disparaging remarks about me to the Pope  because they want to continue to rip off the United States  both on trade and at the border  and they understand I am totally wise to them. The Pope only heard one side of the story - he didn’t see the crime  the drug trafficking and the negative economic impact the current policies have on the United States. He doesn’t see how Mexican leadership is outsmarting President Obama and our leadership in every aspect of negotiation.   For a religious leader to question a person’s faith is disgraceful. I am proud to be a Christian and as President I will not allow Christianity to be consistently attacked and weakened  unlike what is happening now  with our current President. No leader  especially a religious leader  should have the right to question another man’s religion or faith. They are using the Pope as a pawn and they should be ashamed of themselves for doing so  especially when so many lives are involved and when illegal immigration is so rampant.  Donald J.

I am a European. I lived many years in Brussels. I rather love the old place. And so I resent the way we continually confuse Europe – the home of the greatest and richest culture in the world  to which Britain is and will be an eternal contributor – with the political project of the European Union. It is  therefore  vital to stress that there is nothing necessarily anti-European or xenophobic in wanting to vote Leave on June 23.     And it is important to remember: it isn’t we in this country who have changed. It is the European Union. In the 28 years since I first started writing for this paper about the Common Market – as it was then still known – the project has morphed and grown in such a way as to be unrecognisable  rather as the vast new Euro palaces of glass and steel now lour over the little cobbled streets in the heart of the Belgian capital.   When I went to Brussels in 1989  I found well-meaning officials (many of them British) trying to break down barriers to trade with a new procedure – agreed by Margaret Thatcher – called Qualified Majority Voting. The efforts at harmonisation were occasionally comical  and I informed readers about euro-condoms and the great war against the British prawn cocktail flavour crisp. And then came German reunification  and the panicked efforts of Delors  Kohl and Mitterrand to “lock” Germany into Europe with the euro; and since then the pace of integration has never really slackened.   As new countries have joined  we have seen a hurried expansion in the areas for Qualified Majority Voting  so that Britain can be overruled more and more often (as has happened in the past five years). We have had not just the Maastricht Treaty  but Amsterdam  Nice  Lisbon  every one of them representing an extension of EU authority and a centralisation in Brussels. According to the House of Commons library  anything between 15 and 50 per cent of UK legislation now comes from the EU; and remember that this type of legislation is very special.   It is unstoppable  and it is irreversible – since it can only be repealed by the EU itself. Ask how much EU legislation the Commission has actually taken back under its various programmes for streamlining bureaucracy. The answer is none. That is why EU law is likened to a ratchet  clicking only forwards. We are seeing a slow and invisible process of legal colonisation  as the EU infiltrates just about every area of public policy. Then – and this is the key point – the EU acquires supremacy in any field that it touches; because it is one of the planks of Britain’s membership  agreed in 1972  that any question involving the EU must go to Luxembourg  to be adjudicated by the European Court of Justice.   It was one thing when that court contented itself with the single market  and ensuring that there was free and fair trade across the EU. We are now way beyond that stage. Under the Lisbon Treaty  the court has taken on the ability to vindicate people’s rights under the 55-clause “Charter of Fundamental Human Rights”  including such peculiar entitlements as the right to found a school  or the right to “pursue a freely chosen occupation” anywhere in the EU  or the right to start a business.   These are not fundamental rights as we normally understand them  and the mind boggles as to how they will be enforced. Tony Blair told us he had an opt-out from this charter.   Alas  that opt-out has not proved legally durable  and there are real fears among British jurists about the activism of the court. The more the EU does  the less room there is for national decision-making. Sometimes these EU rules sound simply ludicrous  like the rule that you can’t recycle a teabag  or that children under eight cannot blow up balloons  or the limits on the power of vacuum cleaners. Sometimes they can be truly infuriating – like the time I discovered  in 2013  that there was nothing we could do to bring in better-designed cab windows for trucks  to stop cyclists being crushed. It had to be done at a European level  and the French were opposed.   Sometimes the public can see all too plainly the impotence of their own elected politicians – as with immigration. That enrages them; not so much the numbers as the lack of control. That is what we mean by loss of sovereignty – the inability of people to kick out  at elections  the men and women who control their lives. We are seeing an alienation of the people from the power they should hold  and I am sure this is contributing to the sense of disengagement  the apathy  the view that politicians are “all the same” and can change nothing  and to the rise of extremist parties.   Democracy matters; and I find it deeply worrying that the Greeks are effectively being told what to do with their budgets and public spending  in spite of huge suffering among the population. And now the EU wants to go further. There is a document floating around Brussels called “The Five Presidents Report”  in which the leaders of the various EU institutions map out ways to save the euro. It all involves more integration: a social union  a political union  a budgetary union. At a time when Brussels should be devolving power  it is hauling more and more towards the centre  and there is no way that Britain can be unaffected.   David Cameron has done his very best  and he has achieved more than many expected. There is some useful language about stopping “ever-closer union” from applying to the UK  about protecting the euro outs from the euro ins  and about competition and deregulation.   There is an excellent forthcoming Bill that will assert the sovereignty of Parliament  the fruit of heroic intellectual labour by Oliver Letwin  which may well exercise a chilling effect on some of the more federalist flights of fancy of the court and the Commission. It is good  and right  but it cannot stop the machine; at best it can put a temporary and occasional spoke in the ratchet.   There is only one way to get the change we need  and that is to vote to go  because all EU history shows that they only really listen to a population when it says No. The fundamental problem remains: that they have an ideal that we do not share. They want to create a truly federal union  e pluribus unum  when most British people do not.   It is time to seek a new relationship  in which we manage to extricate ourselves from most of the supranational elements. We will hear a lot in the coming weeks about the risks of this option; the risk to the economy  the risk to the City of London  and so on; and though those risks cannot be entirely dismissed  I think they are likely to be exaggerated. We have heard this kind of thing before  about the decision to opt out of the euro  and the very opposite turned out to be the case.   I also accept there is a risk that a vote to Leave the EU  as it currently stands  will cause fresh tensions in the union between England and Scotland. On the other hand  most of the evidence I have seen suggests that the Scots will vote on roughly the same lines as the English.   We will be told that a Brexit would embolden Putin  though it seems to me he is more likely to be emboldened  for instance  by the West’s relative passivity in Syria.   Above all  we will be told that whatever the democratic deficiencies  we would be better off remaining in because of the “influence” we have. This is less and less persuasive to me. Only 4 per cent of people running the Commission are UK nationals  when Britain contains 12 per cent of the EU population. It is not clear why the Commission should be best placed to know the needs of UK business and industry  rather than the myriad officials at UK Trade & Investment or the Department for Business  Innovation and Skills.   If the “Leave” side wins  it will indeed be necessary to negotiate a large number of trade deals at great speed. But why should that be impossible? We have become so used to Nanny in Brussels that we have become infantilised  incapable of imagining an independent future. We used to run the biggest empire the world has ever seen  and with a much smaller domestic population and a relatively tiny Civil Service. Are we really unable to do trade deals? We will have at least two years in which the existing treaties will be in force.   The real risk is to the general morale of Europe  and to the prestige of the EU project. We should take that seriously.   We should remember that this federalist vision is not an ignoble idea. It was born of the highest motives – to keep the peace in Europe. The people who run the various EU institutions – whom we like to ply with crass abuse – are  in my experience  principled and thoughtful officials. They have done some very good things: I think of the work of Sir Leon Brittan  for instance  as Competition Commissioner  and his fight against state aid.   They just have a different view of the way Europe should be constructed. I would hope they would see a vote to leave as a challenge  not just to strike a new and harmonious relationship with Britain (in which those benefits could be retained) but to recover some of the competitiveness that the continent has lost in the last decades.   Whatever happens  Britain needs to be supportive of its friends and allies – but on the lines originally proposed by Winston Churchill: interested  associated  but not absorbed; with Europe – but not comprised. We have spent 500 years trying to stop continental European powers uniting against us. There is no reason (if everyone is sensible) why that should happen now  and every reason for friendliness.   For many Conservatives  this has already been a pretty agonising business. Many of us are deeply internally divided  and we are divided between us. We know that we do not agree on the substance  but I hope we can all agree to concentrate on the arguments; to play the ball and not the man.   At the end of it all  we want to get a result  and then get on and unite around David Cameron – continuing to deliver better jobs  better housing  better health  education and a better quality of life for our constituents for whom (let’s be frank) the EU is not always the number one issue.   It is entirely thanks to the Prime Minister  his bravery and energy  and the fact that he won a majority Conservative government  that we are having a referendum at all. Never forget that if it were down to Jeremy Corbyn and the so-called People’s Party  the people would be completely frozen out.   This is the right moment to have a referendum  because as Europe changes  Britain is changing too. This is a truly great country that is now going places at extraordinary speed. We are the European  if not the world  leaders in so many sectors of the 21st-century economy; not just financial services  but business services  the media  biosciences  universities  the arts  technology of all kinds (of the 40 EU technology companies worth more than $1 billion  17 are British); and we still have a dizzyingly fertile manufacturing sector.   Now is the time to spearhead the success of those products and services not just in Europe  but in growth markets beyond. This is a moment to be brave  to reach out – not to hug the skirts of Nurse in Brussels  and refer all decisions to someone else.   We have given so much to the world  in ideas and culture  but the most valuable British export and the one for which we are most famous is the one that is now increasingly in question: parliamentary democracy – the way the people express their power.   This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to vote for real change in Britain’s relations with Europe. This is the only opportunity we will ever have to show that we care about self-rule. A vote to Remain will be taken in Brussels as a green light for more federalism  and for the erosion of democracy.   In the next few weeks  the views of people like me will matter less and less  because the choice belongs to those who are really sovereign – the people of the UK. And in the matter of their own sovereignty the people  by definition  will get it right.

Tomorrow is your General Election.  You might still be undecided about which way you're going to vote.   And I understand that.  I remember in my first speech as Taoiseach I spoke about how a wound heals from the edges in.  And immediately we began that healing process in our country  together.  We faced choices that no government before us has had to make. And I hope no government will ever have to make again.  Over the past 5 years Ireland has gone from a bankrupt economy to the fastest growing economy in the EU.  It’s a journey that is unique to Ireland. Greece  Spain and Portugal were all in the same boat as us 5 years ago. But the big difference is - they’re still in that boat  as a result of electing unstable governments or because of indecisive election results.  I know what you lost. I know how hard you’ve worked. I know you can’t go back.  And I understand that many of you reading this do not yet feel the recovery in your own lives.  I am as impatient as everyone else for the benefits of recovery to be felt by everyone  in every home  in every community in every corner of our country.    And as we look to the next five years  I know we have it in our grasp to make Ireland a country where you can once again prosper  go to work  start a business  raise a family and grow old with dignity.  That is my ambition for you.   Tomorrow is a really important day for our country and maybe the most important ever. Don't put the progress we are making at risk.  Tomorrow  as you go to make your mark  Ireland's future lies in your hands.  I’m asking you to vote for Fine Gael.

Someone let some puppies loose in the office.  Puppies are obviously insanely cute (and these ones are part of an animal adoption program) but  sadly  not all puppies get the happy life they deserve.  We recently instigated a parliamentary inquiry into animal breeding practices in NSW. Today we announced that we will be reviewing penalties and enforcement measures to ensure that dodgy operators can be dealt with seriously and shut down where necessary. It is simply unacceptable for people to be treating puppies or other animals in a cruel manner in an attempt to make a quick buck. We need to act and we will.  Oh – one of my staff  Nigel  wanted to take one of these puppies home for his birthday. Negotiations are still ongoing with his wife. Come on  Kate… let him keep one.

Yesterday we announced NSW will hold the world’s largest clinical trial of medical cannabis to treat nausea for people undergoing chemo.  It is particularly significant for me personally because Dan Haslam suffered terribly from nausea.. and it was his story that convinced me that we needed to act on medical cannabis.   Meeting Jack yesterday was a reminder to me of what’s at stake here. Jack has had cancer since he was 16 and the chemo can be debilitating. Medical cannabis has the potential to ease his symptoms so he has the stomach to eat and the power to fight.   I understand the pace of change in this area can be frustrating for the many people who need help urgently. But  as determined as I am to get this done quickly  I’m also determined to get it done right as we explore the issues relating to supply  dosage (particularly for children)  and distribution of this potentially life changing treatment. We aren’t just re-doing trials here that have already been done elsewhere. This is necessary research on a scale that has never been seen before.  I’m proud that NSW is leading the world in clinical research of medical cannabis and it’s my hope these trials provide great results to give hope  and help  to those who need it most.

In 2013  Kari Rene Hunt of Marshall  Texas  was stabbed by her estranged husband in a hotel room. When Kari’s 9-year-old daughter tried to dial 9-1-1 for help  she couldn't reach emergency personnel because she didn't dial “9” for an outside line  and Kari died. That's why Senator Deb Fischer of Nebraska and I have introduced Kari's Law  which would require multi-line telephone system manufacturers to ensure that callers can reach 9-1-1 without dialing more numbers. This bipartisan bill builds on the progress already made by industry leaders and helps ensure that tragedies like Kari's never happen again.

Are you frit? Are you frightened? Have they spooked you yet? It is now obvious that the Remain campaign is intended to provoke only one emotion in the breast of the British public and that is fear.   They want us to go to the polls in such a state of quivering apprehension that we do the bidding of the Euro-elites  and vote to stay in the European Union. We may accept  intellectually  that the system is unreformed  and often corrupt  and increasingly anti-democratic. We may recognise that if we were asked to join now  for the first time  that we would not dream of doing so. We may at one level understand that if we vote to Remain  we will continue to sit trapped like passengers in the back seat of some errant minicab with a driver who cannot speak English and who is taking us remorselessly and expensively in the wrong direction.   But the Remain camp clearly calculate that when it comes to the choice – between exit now  or an ever-more constricting entanglement – we will funk it; we won’t take the risk; we will stick with the devil we know. To encourage us in that decision  they are making a series of questionable assertions.   We are told that there would be a threat to the UK economy. We have just had the curious spectacle of HM Treasury insisting on the rewriting of a G20 Communique to include a reference to the potential “shock” from Brexit – surely the first time any country has used an international forum actively to talk up threats to its own economic prospects.   The agents of Project Fear – and they seem to be everywhere – have warned us that leaving the EU would jeopardise police  judicial and intelligence cooperation. We have even been told that the EU has been responsible  over the last 70 years  for “keeping the peace in Europe”. In every case the message is that Brexit is simply too scary; and the reality is that these threats are so wildly exaggerated as to be nonsense.   Indeed I am ever more convinced that the real risk is to sit back and do nothing  to remain inertly and complacently in an unreformed EU that is hell-bent on a federal project over which we have no control.   Take the so-called economic risks. Remember when you weigh them up that the people now issuing the blood-curdling warnings against Brexit are often the very same (as the former governor of the Bank of England  Mervyn King  just pointed out) as the people who prophesied disaster if Britain failed to join the euro. In fact  the opposite turned out to be true. It was the euro that proved to be a nightmare  an economic doomsday machine that is still causing low growth  high unemployment and real misery in some European countries.   The single currency is also the cause of tensions between European countries  and rhetoric of a virulence and nastiness we have not seen since the second world war. We have had anti-German riots in Greece; we have seen Angela Merkel burned in effigy in Greece. In France  relations with Germany are said to be at a post-war nadir and support for the National Front is at an all-time high. Instead of recognising this disaster for what it is – the result of an over-centralising plan to fuse diverse economies into one – the EU is determined to keep going in the wrong direction.   Francois Hollande is calling for a new federal parliament of the eurozone  and there are explicit plans to try to save the euro by creating an ever tighter political and fiscal union  with legislative consequences that would embroil Britain even though we are out of the eurozone.   We stand on the brink of another huge new centralising leap – a leap in the dark  to coin a phrase – which means less democracy  less accountability and therefore a greater risk of disillusion and eventual political eruption. It isn’t Brexit that presents the economic risk; it is the euro  and the federalising attempts to save it that are the real long-term threat to security and stability.   As for the notion that the EU is somehow the military guarantor of peace in Europe – remember what happened when the EU was entrusted with sorting out Yugoslavia. Remember Ukraine. It is Nato and the Atlantic alliance that underpins our security  as Maj Gen Julian Thompson outlines elsewhere in this paper today. EU pretensions in the area are at best confusing and at worst likely to encourage American disengagement.   It is simply untrue  finally  to say that leaving the EU would make it impossible for us to concert our activities in intelligence or counter-terrorism or policing. All these operations can be conducted at an intergovernmental level – as indeed they used to be  until fairly recently.   On the contrary  it is the European Court of Justice  with its vast new remit over the Charter of Fundamental Rights  that is making it harder month by month for the security services to get on with their job – whether it be expelling murderers or monitoring terrorist suspects. It is the border-free Europe  obviously  that makes it so much easier for our enemies to move around. As Ronald K Noble  the former head of Interpol  has said  the Schengen area is “like a sign welcoming terrorists to Europe”.    Whatever the risks of Brexit  they are eclipsed by the problems of remaining in a political construct that has changed out of all recognition since we joined in 1972. What we need to do now is screw up our courage and go for change. We need a new partnership and a new deal with our friends in the EU  based on trade and cooperation  but without this supranational apparatus that is so out of date and is imitated nowhere else.   It is a once in a lifetime chance to energise our democracy  cut bureaucracy  save £8bn a year  control our borders and strike new trade deals with growth economies that are currently forbidden. Vote Leave would be good for Britain and the only way to jolt the EU into the reform it needs. Let’s call it Project Hope.

DONALD J. TRUMP ENDORSED BY NASCAR CEO AND DRIVERS   (Valdosta  GA) February 29th  2016 – Today Donald J. Trump was endorsed by Brian France  Chairman & CEO of NASCAR  popular retired driver Bill Elliott  and active drivers Chase Elliott  Ryan Newman  and David Lee Regan. France  Elliott  and the drivers endorsed Mr. Trump at a rally attended by thousands in Valdosta  Georgia just one day before the Super Tuesday primary.   Mr. Trump said  “I am proud to receive the endorsement of such an iconic brand and a quality person such as Brian. Brian has a wonderful family and is an incredibly successful business person. I have great respect for Brian and I am grateful for his support and that of Bill Elliott  one of the best drivers in history  and active stock car racers  including his son Chase Elliott  Ryan Newman and David Lee Regan.”   Brian France added  “Mr. Trump is changing American politics forever and his leadership and strength are desperately needed. He has had an incredible career and achieved tremendous success. This is what we need for our country.”   Bill Elliott said  “It is my great honor to endorse Mr. Trump for President of the United States. He is a leader representing strength and common sense solutions.”   These influential endorsements come just days after former Presidential candidate and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie  and Senator Jeff Sessions  recognized by many as the conservative soul of the U.S. Senate  offered their endorsements of the republican frontrunner.   Mr. Trump continues to dominate in state and national polls with the most recent survey from CNN showing Mr. Trump with 49% support nationwide.

The Fine Gael members of the Cabinet met this morning to review the general election.  Despite the disappointing outcome of the election  which did not return the outgoing Fine Gael – Labour Government  Fine Gael will be the largest group in the new Dáil and we are determined to play our part in providing the Irish people with a Government committed to working on their behalf.  We will engage fully and inclusively with other parties  groups and independent deputies to ensure that such a Government is established.  Following our meeting today  we will continue our internal party discussions with the incoming Fine Gael Parliamentary Party on Thursday. In consultation with our elected representatives  we will formulate a set of principles that will guide Fine Gael participation in a future government. These principles will take account of the issues of concern that were highlighted and prioritised by the Irish people during the election campaign.  We look forward to discussing these and other ideas with the other parties and groups in a new Dáil that reflects the changed circumstances following the election.

Thirty-three years ago today the Hawke Labor Government was elected. Bob's Government introduced Medicare  universal access provisions for superannuation   key environmental protections and increased funding for schools & TAFE – all while strengthening our economy and Australia’s place in the world.

I have lived a blessed life and achieved more success than I ever dreamed was possible. Running for President was never on my bucket list  and when I was drafted by a grassroots movement asking me to do so  it was not a decision that I made lightly and saw as an act of service.   However  I believed that my values  life experience and common sense solutions put me in a position to help get our nation back on track for the sake of our children and grandchildren. This grueling endeavor would not have been worth it for any other reason.  When I began exploring a run for President as a private citizen detached from the political class  I had neither a political team nor a national network of wealthy donors standing by waiting to support me.  We had to build a grassroots campaign from scratch by reaching out to as many people as possible  as quickly as possible and through every means possible  resulting in indisputable success. This movement consistently outraised the entire Republican field  got onto every ballot and built a 50-state  bricks-and-mortar campaign infrastructure to share my story  values and solutions. It was an historic feat  and I’ll be forever grateful to my team and my incredible supporters  financial and otherwise  from all corners of America  on behalf of the best interests of the American people.  I hope my presence added a measure of civility to the race  raised issues that would not otherwise have been discussed and had an overall positive impact. While our political efforts must come to a close  gratefully  the grassroots movement that has given new voice to “We the People” and inspired millions will continue.   I may be departing the campaign trail  but I will not be departing the scene.  Instead  for the rest of my life  I will continue to work tirelessly to do everything I can to save America for the next generation.   I will be working on a number of initiatives  including serving as honorary chair of My Faith Votes  a non-profit organization dedicated to mobilizing the 25 million Evangelicals who didn't vote in the last election. The twin pillars of faith and family are under attack  and I will endeavor to strengthen our nation by preserving them both.  I have committed to not endorse a specific individual  but rather “We the People.” Though many today are making decisions based on fear and anger  I trust their judgment to logically examine the candidates and make the right decision by looking at:  (1) Whether they have demonstrated significant accomplishments over their lives and careers.  (2) If they have ideas that are clear and policies that are easy to find.  (3) How they treat their family and others  as that is how they will lead the country.  (4) What they have done to improve the lives of Americans; the people they are with  what they are saying and how they collaborate with others.  (5) Their ethics  because what America needs is “Trickle-down ethics.  Conservatives should not be embarrassed by capitalism  but must couple it with compassion  to lift people out of a culture of dependency and provide ladders of opportunity for all Americans to be a part of the fabric of society.  People need to understand this is a most important election  in which we are deciding whether we allow the government to dictate our rights and take care of our needs  or whether individuals will rise up and take responsibility in an atmosphere of opportunity for all.  The bottom line is  “We the People” are the ones making the decisions; but in order to do that  we must become active and informed  not manipulated by the political classes and media.  Along with millions of patriots who have supported my campaign for President  I remain committed to saving America for future generations. We must not depart from our goals to restore what God and our Founders intended for this exceptional nation.   Equally important  we need to understand that Republicans are not each others' enemies. We need to engage in conversation and challenge each others' positions  not fight each other. Conservatives need to unify together so that that we do not snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and put another secular progressive in the White House.

The truth is  women are underpaid in the workplace and underrepresented in the boardroom. And we need to fix it. Not just with words  but with actions.  Today is International Women’s Day and I was proud to make an important commitment that I hope leads to cultural change right across NSW.   First  here is the state of play when it comes to women in the workforce.  The pay-gap in NSW is currently at 17.9 per cent. For every $100 a man is paid  a woman is paid $82.10 for the same work. This is a higher gap than the national average. NSW may be leading the nation on most economic metrics. But we are lagging on this one. And it is unacceptable.   But it isn’t just the pay-gap that is a problem. There is also a gap in representation in boardroom and leadership roles. For example… 64 per cent of government sector employees are women. But only 36 per cent of senior leadership roles are filled by women.  We already have a target to make sure women make up 50 per cent of these leadership roles. But  as important as targets are  we need more than targets. We need action.  There is a complex mix of things that cause these problems  but research shows that a big one is the lack of flexibility in the workplace. We are still expecting people to be chained to their desks from 8am-6pm. Not only does this shut many women out of the workforce or block their promotional path – it also makes no sense in the modern workplace.  We need the option to work flexibly to be the norm for both men and women.   “Flexible work” could mean doing 4 days work over 5. Or it could mean working longer hours and doing 5 days work over 4. It could mean early starts and finishing in time to pick up the kids from school. It could mean working from home. It could mean job-sharing.  At the moment  there simply aren’t enough flexibility in roles that allow for family priorities to be kept. Even more than that  there is often a perception that someone in a flexible role is not doing their fair share and this false perception translates into blocking their promotional path.  Currently only 1-2 per cent of senior leaders in NSW government roles work flexibly. So you can see why flexible work is perceived to be an obstacle to promotion. If the perception is that senior leaders need to be tied to their desks  then lots of people conclude they won’t rise to senior ranks by working flexibly. And they don’t.  Not yet  anyway.   Today I announced that  by 2019  100 per cent of NSW government sector roles will be flexible by default. Rather than a flexible role being a concession or exception  it needs to be a case of “if not  why not”. There will still be some roles where flexibility isn’t achievable. But that needs to be the new exception rather than the rule.  We are also going to create a job-sharing register to help facilitate certain aspects of this. And we are implementing training for senior leaders so they can understand why flexibility is important.  It should never be the case that a parent is too nervous to ask in a job interview about working a portion of their load from home because they fear it may jeopardise their chances of getting the job. It should be the case that we are always asking “how can we make this role flexible?”  It is my hope that we can transform the culture of the workplace so that it is normal for people to work in a way that suits their life stage and the needs of their families. It is my hope this encourages more women back into the workforce. It is my hope it encourages more men to work flexibly in a way that helps their families. And it is my hope this leads to more women being promoted into senior leadership roles. Not only is it the right outcome from a gender-equity perspective  we know that more gender-diverse leadership teams actually perform better and produce a superior economic benefit as well.  There is still quite a long road ahead to close the pay gap and the leadership gap. But it is my hope that today  on International Women’s Day  NSW just took a big step in the right direction.

The murder of Lee Rigby was an event that outraged and sickened Londoners  and the memories of that tragedy are still raw. I find it absolutely incredible that Sadiq Khan  a candidate for the office of Mayor of London  could hire as his speechwriter someone who has suggested that event was in any way fabricated.

Two Ways to Fix Inequality - Judith Levine  Seven Days:  Working people can't afford to eat. Last year one in five Americans was on food stamps. In Vermont  the number was one in six. These people work: Six in 10 households nationally earned money the month they started getting help; nine in 10 worked in the previous or following year.  People earning the minimum wage can't afford to eat if they also want to live indoors. With heat.  At Vermont's 2013 minimum wage  $8.46 an hour (it's now $8.73)  two full-time  year-round job holders bring in a total of about $2 900 a month. According to Hunger Free Vermont's analysis  based on the basic-needs budget of the Vermont Legislative Joint Fiscal Office (JFO)  their bills leave them a deficit of about $2 100 each month.

Road Projects in Jeopardy:   A Senate panel was warned on Thursday that a looming shortfall in federal transportation funding could cancel construction projects this summer and put people out of work. “Reducing or eliminating transportation projects translates into job losses in the construction industry ” Vermont Agency of Transportation Deputy Secretary Sue Minter told the Senate public works committee. “In a small state like ours  this can tip the balance on our fragile economic recovery.” Sen. Bernie Sanders invited the Vermont official to testify about the need to shore up the Highway Trust Fund  which relies almost entirely on gasoline taxes.

Huck PAC and I first endorsed Chuck Fleischmann for Congress in 2010  when he made his first try at elective office.  Chuck won election then and was reelected in 2012.  He has proven that our endorsement was well deserved with his consistent votes on important conservative issues.  Chuck is passionately pro-life and has voted for the ban on partial-birth abortions as well as voting in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood.  He also is a strong opponent of Obamacare and has voted to protect the Second Amendment at every opportunity.  In fact  Chuck has a 100% pro-life and 2nd Amendment voting record.  Chuck is a fiscal conservative as well as being a social conservative.  He has voted to cut $1.6 trillion from the federal budget and supports a balanced budget amendment.

Huck PAC and I have endorsed Bruce Westerman for Congress.  Here is just one reason why  his strong stand for repealing Obamacare:  ""When Nancy Pelosi said passing Obamacare would allow us to see what was in it  I am sure she was hoping people would overlook the subsidies portion of the law ruled on today by two different circuit courts.  In fact  both rulings  though conflicting  highlight the fact that Obamacare was a poorly-written takeover of people's healthcare and an ill-conceived law that would be enforced by a scandal-plagued IRS.  There is only one option for Obamacare at this point: Repeal."

Attention Michigan:  Huck PAC and I are proud to endorse Gary Glenn for Michigan State Representative. Gary Glenn  I first met Gary six years ago  and the more I've learned about his life's work  the more impressed I am at his knowledge and experience on a wide array of issues. Gary has been a nationally recognized leader on labor law reform  free market healthcare reform  School Choice  and defense of commonly-shared community values such as protecting prenatal life and traditional marriage.  Gary Glenn has a life-long track record of actually getting things done for our conservative values and principles. He is recognized as a strong pro-life leader in Michigan  and supports the 2nd Amendment. Gary was one of two coauthors of Michigan's Marriage Protection Amendment and as a state representative he will sponsor legislation for a state Fair Tax.  I hope you will join the Huck PAC family and me in supporting Gary Glenn for Michigan State Representative at the polls on August 5th.

Communiquer est le premier pas à faire pour changer les choses et mettre fin aux préjugés que suscite la santé mentale. Au Canada  une personne sur cinq sera personnellement touchée par une maladie mentale au cours de sa vie. Nous devons continuer à en parler et dire aux gens qui en sont victimes qu’ils ne sont pas seuls et que nous sommes à leurs côtés.

Des économistes de l'Université de Calgary  de l'Université Laval et de l'Université de la Colombie-Britannique ont tous affirmé que le plan des conservateurs concernant l'assurance-emploi était une entrave à la croissance. Pourquoi le premier ministre n'offre-t-il pas plutôt une exonération des cotisations d'assurance-emploi à l'égard de tout nouvel employé embauché par une entreprise canadienne? Voilà une bonne façon de créer des emplois et de stimuler la croissance.

My wife Janet and I are privileged to consider Sean and Sandy Parnell our friends of many years.  Governor Parnell has been a rock solid conservative for Alaska and is one of the strongest pro life governors in the country.  The Juneau Empire reported that  if legislation on marriage equality or abortion rights comes to the desk when Bill Walker is Governor  he said:  “We’ll make that decision at that time. I can’t guarantee how I will decide on a bill that comes across our desk.”  You don’t have to wonder where Governor Parnell stands on life.  Supporting traditional marriage and protecting the unborn are foundational issues.  Governor Parnell’s record has earned him the support of National Right to Life and the Alaska Family Council.  I hope you will join me in supporting Sean Parnell for reelection as Governor.  Please visit www.Parnell2014.com to volunteer  make a generous contribution or learn more.

An Unsung Heroine:  “Gretchen Bailey is an unsung heroine ” said Sen. Bernie Sanders. He was describing the Senate office’s casework coordinator whose last day on the job was Monday.  Bailey led a team that has helped tens of thousands of Vermonters cut through red tape. Sometimes the federal bureaucracy needs a nudge and “that’s what we do ” she once said. Earlier this year  she won a prestigious award for exemplary public service.  “Gretchen strongly believes that government should work for people ” Sanders wrote a letter nominating her for the award. “Gretchen has dedicated her life to this mission.”  Read more about Gretchen: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/vermont/helping-one-vermonter-at-a-time	LER	link	90.98	93.03	1.00	97.45	12.78	27.83	6.09	0.87	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.87	0.87	1.74	0.87	0.00	0.00	0.87	1.74	0.00	1.74	4.35	5.22	2.61	0.00	0.00	0.87	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00

For too long American families and workers have been pushed aside while self aggrandizing Washington DC politicians feign leadership and offer only political theater and flowery speeches. For too long an out of control judiciary has forced their compromised values on Americans of faith and American seniors have had to live in fear of politicians stealing from Social Security. For too long  we have watched our nation’s security erode  withered by political correctness and liberal ideology.  It’s time we take our nation back.  This Saturday  I'm kicking off my “Americans First” tour that will take me all over the state of Iowa.  I hope you will join me at one of these stops and join my campaign to bring real leadership to Washington  prosperity to American workers  security to our nations seniors and to lead a revival of our national conscience.  Friend  the race in Iowa remains wide open. Over 2/3 of Iowa voters remain undecided on whom to support and our campaign is heating up. Together  we can not only win Iowa  we can win the White House and change the course of our nation.  I hope to see you in Indianola on Saturday!

Iowa: On the campaign trail  many people ask me why pass the FairTax? My answer is simple: Our current system is backwards. Why do we punish hard work and income? Why does our tax system reward irresponsibility? By taxing sales instead of income  we encourage productivity and savings  which will jump-start our economy. Americans also spend more than $500 billion complying with our tax code each year. This is an inefficient waste of time  energy and money.

Today  I'm kicking off a series of campaign events in South Carolina. My campaign stops are listed below. I hope you will join me at one of these stops and join my campaign to bring real leadership to Washington  prosperity to American workers  security to our nations seniors and to lead a revival of our national conscience.  The race in South Carolina remains wide open. Over 2/3 of South Carolina voters -- just like Iowa -- remain undecided on whom to support and our campaign is heating up at the right moment.  That means we can not only win Iowa and South Carolina  we can win the White House and change the course of our nation.  I hope to see you at one of these events.
