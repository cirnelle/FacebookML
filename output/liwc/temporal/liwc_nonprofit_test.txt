This week  Senator Ted Cruz held a hearing to attack the clean air and clean water safeguards that protect millions of families all across America. Sierra Club President Aaron Mair was there to talk about how communities of color  which are disproportionately affected by pollution and climate disruption  rely on these safeguards to protect them.    A friend to big polluters  Cruz unsurprisingly tried to cover all their talking points. His game? To attack the climate science that shows how carbon pollution from burning fossil fuels is causing climate disruption in the first place while assailing the Clean Power Plan  which would allow us to act on climate disruption and protect people’s health.   Well  Sierra Club President Aaron Mair has a few things to share with Senator Cruz. Check out his response.

Every one one of those goals is linked to climate change. This December  as world leaders meet in Paris to negotiate a climate deal  they must take bold steps to build a better future for us all.

PRAISE REPORT: “I like how it looks. I feel like a different person ” Matilde said after her cleft lip repair in La Paz  Bolivia. Our first patient in this country  Matilde had surgery just yesterday and was released from the hospital this morning. Her face is swollen and it is still painful for her to smile  but those routine post-operation issues will soon disappear.  After more than four decades of stigma—at one point  her community absurdly accused her of being a witch—she begins a new journey. Tonight she is safely home with her husband and her two daughters  with whom she can now go into the big city without fear of people making fun of her.

BREAKING: President Obama just rejected the Keystone XL pipeline!  Here's a statement from NRDC president Rhea Suh: "This represents a courageous leap forward in the climate fight. Rejecting the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline is right for our nation  for our children and for our planet. It would have locked in  for a generation or more  massive development of among the dirtiest fuels on the planet – posing a serious threat to our air  land water  and climate. The proposal  pushed largely by the fossil fuel industry  was a recipe for disaster. In no way was the pipeline in America’s national interest. Dangerous climate change is the central environmental challenge of our time  and it’s time for everyone to step up now and meet that challenge."

Meet May and Eric. During the Gulf War  the couple were forced to flee their home country of Iraq  but were granted asylum and earned their citizenship in the United States. For 17 years  their Best Farmer’s Market has been an anchor in a Phoenix urban neighborhood where grocery stores and other retailers are scarce. The couple have adapted their market from serving the primarily Hispanic population when they first opened to now filling the needs of a growing refugee and African demographic.  Refugees supporting other refugees-- what a great example for us all.  May and Eric received a micro-enterprise loan through the IRC in Phoenix  funded through a Whole Planet Foundation Whole Foods Market grant.  We are so proud of refugees like May and Eric who continue to make a positive impact in the United States. #RefugeesWelcome  Photo: Ethan Fichtner	HER	photo	90.53	75.94	15.02	77.59	17.75	23.24	3.52	0.70	0.00	0.70	0.00	0.00	1.41	0.70	2.11	1.41	2.11	0.70	0.00	0.00	2.82	2.82	2.82	2.82	0.70	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00

MSF and Greenpeace International have launched joint lifesaving operations in the Aegean Sea and will coordinate with the Greek coast guard.

Those rescued include one newborn baby (about 2 months old) with his uncle (refugees from Iraq)  and a young man from Syria. Everyone on the refugee boat was able to reach land while MSF reunited the family and friends after the arrival at port in Molyvos.

Douglas is a disabled veteran living on the streets of Hollywood. He sleeps on the sidewalk every night.  Douglas says wherever he lays his head is home.   There is a big push in this country to end veteran homelessness  and there should be. Douglas is disabled and confined to a wheelchair. He is missing one leg. Clearly there is something wrong if Douglas is calling a sidewalk home.   Service providers have offered Douglas a bed in a shelter  but he finds the streets to be safer. During my Los Angeles trip  I ran into a few people who should not be homeless on Hollywood Blvd  and they were also only offered shelter  yet returned to the streets. I know the folks in Hollywood working to end homelessness and they are giving their all  but obviously  they are not being provided the tools or housing needed to help these people.  All of the folks I met received disability income and qualify for housing  but of course  there has to be housing available.   Douglas says he loves our country  but he feels our government sucks.  Knowing Douglas slept outside the night of this interview  I have to agree with him.   What do you think?

BREAKING: An orca has just died at SeaWorld San Antonio.   Unna is the 38th orca used by SeaWorld to die far short of how long she was expected to live  though it is in fact hard to call it 'living' when her 'life' consisted of being taken away from her mother just before her sixth birthday  being impregnated when she was only 8 years old & giving birth to a stillborn orca  & being so deprived of enrichment & the ability to engage in natural behavior that she obsessively picked at the paint on the bottom of SeaWorld's show pool floor until her face became badly injured  says PETA Foundation Wildlife Veterinarian Dr. Heather Rally.   While the infection that killed this orca is common in captivity  there is no evidence to suggest that the same is true of orcas in nature. PETA is calling on SeaWorld to stop sentencing orcas to miserable lives of deprivation in dismal tanks & start building coastal sanctuaries. Thirty-eight dead orcas is 38 too many.  R.I.P.

BREAKING: RINGLING TO TAKE ELEPHANTS OFF THE ROAD 18 MONTHS EARLY.   Because of failing financial returns from a public that lost a taste for abusive elephant acts long ago & legislatures that are banning them on the grounds of cruelty  it’s no surprise that Ringling Bros. will pull elephants off the road in May  18 months earlier than announced.   Years of living in shackles  held immobile on concrete floors  has left many elephants lame & sick. As a study released just days ago by the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention confirms  elephants can transmit tuberculosis to humans  & Ringling has had TB-positive elephants going from town to town.   Since Ringling is also known to breed elephants & use them as test subjects at the Florida facility where it keeps elephants in shackles  PETA warns that because the circus has refused to retire these elephants to an accredited sanctuary  vigilance will be needed to determine how they are treated. PETA is also calling on the circus to end all animal acts  particularly in light of video footage released last month showing how tigers are trained to perform: http://peta.vg/1osm	HER	photo	93.81	62.52	41.31	2.43	26.86	29.79	1.06	3.72	0.00	1.06	1.60	1.06	3.72	0.53	0.53	1.60	0.53	1.60	0.00	0.00	0.53	1.06	1.60	1.06	2.13	0.00	0.53	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00

It was not hard to notice Alexander was living homeless in Boston. He was carrying most everything he owned on his back.  Before I started the camera  I asked Alexander how long he was on the streets. He responded: "seven years as a woman  and now two years as a man".  What I didn't see from a distance is Alexander is a transgender male.   Alexander's story is important because homelessness is a critical issue for transgender people  with one in five having experienced homelessness at some time in their lives because of discrimination and family rejection. To me  Alexander's story is heartbreaking  and I so admire his courage to be so open.  Because Alexander is still in transition going from a woman to a man  homeless shelters will not provide services  leaving his only choice to be sleeping outside. Also  he is caught in the housing bureaucracy madness.  Alexander has been on a housing waiting list since 2012!  This interview is a little longer than most  but it's an important conversation  and I hope you'll watch to the end. Alexander has been caught in a perpetual cycle of frustration for eight and a half years now  and he says if it continues for another eight years it will be "twenty years waiting to be housed. Twenty years waiting to be me  and twenty years at the same income level".   *For more please visit: Transgender Homelessness and My Visit with TRANS: THRIVE  http://invisiblepeople.tv/blog/2012/04/transgender-homelessness-and-my-visit-with-trans-thrive/	HER	video	69.70	69.42	53.23	39.75	18.29	21.88	2.34	1.56	0.00	0.78	0.78	0.78	1.95	0.78	1.95	0.39	2.34	0.78	0.39	0.39	0.78	0.00	3.52	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.39	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.39

BREAKING: A BABY ELEPHANT HAS JUST DIED AT RINGLING'S TRAINING FACILITY.    Mike was only 2 years old. This young elephant's sad death is no surprise given that four other baby elephants have died under Ringling's watch  including one 8-month-old whose hind legs were shattered during circus training & a 3-year-old who drowned in a pond while trying to get away from a trainer with a bullhook—a weapon that resembles a fireplace poker with a sharp steel hook on one end.   Ringling still uses these weapons at its Florida compound  where elephants are separated from their mothers shortly after birth & beaten into submission & elephants are chained on concrete for many hours each day.   These stressful conditions have been linked to the highly fatal disease that killed this calf  which disproportionately impacts captive baby elephants  yet Ringling continues to breed more babies for a life in chains. These deaths are precisely why PETA is calling for an end to Ringling's breeding program & for all of these elephants to be retired to a proper accredited sanctuary.

Ron is a disabled Vietnam veteran homeless in Boston.  This time  he has been without a home for five months. Ron was in transitional housing  but he says they were not helping and only taking his money.   Ron says he's living moment to moment while hoping for the best  yet he says that never happens.   Ron's story breaks my heart. No one should have to live on the streets homeless  and especially not the men and women who bravely served our country. It's interesting that cities around the U.S. are claiming they have put an end to veteran homelessness  and there has been a lot of progress  but the real truth is many veterans are still without a home and we still have a lot of work to do.

"What struck me most about the refugees I met is that they are just trying to move forward in their lives and provide for their families." - Ben Stiller   "It’s hard to imagine their situation – being totally displaced by the literal destruction of their homes and livelihoods by war  having to put their children’s lives in the hands of illegal traffickers and get on an overcrowded boat to try to reach Europe because there is no other way to reach safety. Yet despite all that has happened to them  they are focusing in a very practical way on the future  especially the future of their children."   Ben met refugee families  including Hassan  Nahed  and their children Mohamed and Mayyar  in Berlin last week. At the emergency shelter the Berlin district of Wilmersdorf  where the family are living at present  Ben discussed the situation in Germany  across Europe and the wider Syrian crisis.  Nahed and Hassan left Aleppo  Syria  in July 2015  making the heart-breaking decision to leave their home and business when the bombing became too much. They paid smugglers $1 200 per person to cross in the tiny boat to Greece. They are learning German and told Ben they hope to find work  a new home – and most importantly  get Mohamed and Mayyar back to school.

Donate here: https://www.razoo.com/us/story/Invisiblepeople-2016  INVISIBLE PEOPLE CONNECTS PEOPLE TO THE FACE OF HOMELESSNESS in a direct and meaningful way that humanizes & normalizes the subject and builds empathy in the viewer. This is achieved by 'raw'  unedited and unscripted stories of people experiencing homelessness as well as through the medium chosen (social media and the internet).  THIS IS WAY MORE IMPORTANT AND IMPACTFUL THAN SIMPLE AWARENESS. It's easy for homeless people to be an 'other'. Invisible People makes them real people with real stories. Once people are real  normal and sympathetic  it is easier for the general public to take action in support of ending homelessness. That action can be giving  donating  volunteering or voting. Empathetic awareness is critical to creating change.  DID YOU KNOW that Invisible People is the only national awareness and educational campaign on homelessness? Just turn on the TV and you'll see anti-smoking ads  don't text and drive videos are all over the internet  and awareness campaigns from the need to recycle to global warming are everywhere we look  and they should be. Yet except for Invisible People  there are zero campaigns teaching the general public the truth about homelessness.  THE GENERAL PUBLIC RECEIVES MAJORITY OF THEIR EDUCATION ON HOMELESSNESS FROM NONPROFIT FUNDRAISING MATERIALS. Nonprofits flood mailboxes  inboxes and social media with marketing materials crafted with the sole purpose of acquiring donors. The information presented in fundraising materials is not always the truth  yet the vast majority of the general public accept this information as fact. The problem with this is  the public is misinformed and wrong stereotypes are reinforced through fundraising materials. This creates more nimbyism (not in my backyard) and more support for criminalization  which is increasing across the country. All this while one side is saying they are reducing homelessness  while the other side is calling for a State of Emergency to be declared because they have never seen homelessness so bad. This is why it's harder than ever to find support to help fight homelessness  and why Invisible People's work is important. .  This year I turn 55 years-old. 55 is kind of a big number and most birthday campaigns ask for donations based on the age. I am simply asking for a donation of any size. Every and any amount counts  and WITHOUT YOUR SUPPORT  THERE WOULD BE NO INVISIBLE PEOPLE.  Our work stops without you!  ***Your donation is tax deductible	HER	video	79.20	78.48	20.29	75.96	16.92	27.34	3.94	1.23	0.00	0.49	0.00	2.71	2.46	0.99	1.23	2.46	2.46	1.23	0.25	0.49	3.20	1.72	5.67	0.74	0.99	0.00	0.25	0.00	0.25	0.00	0.25	0.25

“If someone tries to harass me  I need to learn how to defend myself. My brother won’t be always around to protect me. I need to be independent.”  Nine-year-old Solaf had only been in Azraq refugee camp in Jordan for a few days when she saw other children her age running around in white robes. Curious  she followed them around to camp to find 50 boys and two girls participating in taekwondo training. She knew instantly she had to join them.   “When I saw the movements the kids were doing  I knew that was something I wanted to learn.”  Her parents support their multitalented daughter and raise her to realize she can achieve anything she wants to in life. And they’ve long known Solaf possesses a confidence not common in girls her age. With tears of pride in his eyes  her father told us of her strength back home in Syria:   “During a demonstration  she spoke to a camera while holding a rocket. She said ‘This is how you treat the children of Syria?’ She was just five years old  but her message was strong.”  Solaf’s curiosity and spirit continue to fuel her  even in exile. She’s also training in football and volleyball. And we can’t wait to see what’s next for her – go Solaf!

Jennifer is a young woman confined to a wheelchair and homeless in Toronto.  Watching Jennifer's video  I get emotional - and then I get mad.   Jennifer has spent much of her young life on the streets. In her teens  she spent six years outside. This is now the second winter outside since Jennifer has had a wheelchair.    Homelessness is hard. Now imagine being disabled and most homeless services are not wheelchair user accessible. Jennifer can get into the lobby of the nearest shelter  but after that the stairs prevent her from further access.   Please take a few moments and watch Jennifer say her three wishes at the end  and then please share this video with everyone you know.  Stories like Jennifers need to be seen and never forgotten.

"For the first year I lived in the camp  I was depressed—I struggled to cope with the living conditions and the stress of trying to make sure my family was taken care of. But then one day I said to myself—I have to deal with this. I have to move on and rebuild. I changed my whole mindset and worked really hard—I was lucky enough to find a job  and I began to rebuild my sewing business  which was destroyed in Syria. I managed to save up and buy a sewing machine and now I have a backlog of orders. I consider myself an activist—not necessarily a political one  but I go out and help others—even in the camp. I have some medical training so I walk around to see if anyone is sick or wounded—I also assist doctors and EMTs from time to time. It has been a constant struggle  but now I am more powerful. I want my daughters to finish school. I want my business to grow. I want stability. And I am slowly making things happen.” — Dalal  a Syrian refugee living in Jordan whom the IRC spoke to in 2014.

Americans throw away 35 billion plastic water bottles a year. Yup  that's "billion" with a B.  Don't hit it and quit it. Switching to a reusable bottle (like a Nalgene or one made of aluminum) reduces the amount of plastic that ends up in landfills or as litter.  Challenge your friends to make it one week using a reusable bottle instead of plastic water bottles. The only thing more baller than poppin' bottles? Re-poppin' bottles.

Know what it takes to be a Foot Locker Scholar-Athlete? Meet one of our past winners to find out.  At the age of 16  2014-2015 Foot Locker Scholar Athlete Winner Nicholas Hibbeler was diagnosed with testicular cancer. Despite being hospitalized often  he remained committed to his schoolwork and soccer team  continuing to play at the most competitive level. Propelled by his own experiences  Nicholas began organizing Kick-Out Cancer soccer matches  raising nearly $10 000 for children fighting cancer. He then launched the “CHECK 2 Campaign ” which encourages athletes to perform self-checks and request a testicular examination during sports physicals as an early detection measure. Now  he is officially cancer-free  and kicking ass as a soccer player at University of Wisconsin  Green Bay.  Nominate someone you know who inspires you both on and off the field  like Nicholas  for a $20 000 scholarship from our friends at Foot Locker.

A group of college students at Maryville College collected between 100-200 pounds of unused food every week at their school's dining hall. In total  they've been able to collect and donate 1 500 pounds of food to non-profits.  We applaud these students for all of their hard work! 35 MILLION tons of food are thrown away each year. Instead of being thrown out  leftover food can be donated through food recovery programs to shelters serving those in need.

In 2015 it was reported that minorities make up 26% of female characters  who in turn collectively make up only 30 percent of speaking characters in films.  Female protagonists lead 12% of films  and most are portrayed by white actresses.  The lack of ethnic diversity among heroines poses a serious issue for Hollywood  whose efforts to portray powerful women have been limited for women of color.  Women are more likely to be successful when they see that other women who look like them are successful. Promote the concept of diverse women in film by using our FREE template to create and share a new protagonist you'd like to see represented in Hollywood.

The prevalence of weight discrimination in the United States has increased by 66% over the past decade.  Removing or defacing fat-shaming messages highlights social stigma around bodies that are not “ideal” and misconceptions that thin = healthy.

South Dakota governor vetoed a bill on Tuesday that would force transgender students to use the locker room and restroom of the gender they were assigned at birth. In a letter to the Legislature  Daugaard argued  “As policymakers in South Dakota  we often recite that the best government is the government closest to the people. Local school districts can  and have  made necessary restroom and locker room accommodations that serve the best interests of all students  regardless of biological sex or gender identity.”  70% of transgender and gender nonconforming people experience some form of harassment in public restrooms. Gender neutral bathrooms allow trans and gender nonconforming people to feel safer when they've gotta go.

With the help of Make-A-Wish America and Make-A-Wish Missouri  eight-year-old Amelia was able to make her wish of taking care of the world come true by picking up trash with her friends and community over the weekend.  When asked about why picking up trash is important to her  Amelia said  “it doesn’t look nice and another reason is because it can stay dirty and it can get animals sick."  Amelia inspired the Kansas City community so much  Mayor Sly James named February 27  2016 “Amelia Meyer’s Take Care Of The World Day.”  Cleaning up trash in an area makes people less likely to litter there in the future. Join our Trash Scavenger Hunt and show your friends that trash clean-ups can be fun! Let's take care of the world with Amelia.

Kim and Brad Lancaster of Shoreline  a city north of Seattle  have turned their 770-square-foot house and small yard into a homeless camp  improving the lives of 16 people without homes.  "I have convictions about us being humans together " Lancaster told KIRO Radio.  There has been 18 people living at the Lancasters' home since December -- four of whom are children -- that are sharing one bathroom  a small kitchen and a washer and dryer.  We love what the Lancasters are doing to help the homeless. Every year  MILLIONS of people find themselves without a home and access to basic items. You can help people experiencing homelessness by making Blessing Bags by collecting important day-to-day items. We'll give you a list of them and how to donate them to your local homeless shelter.

There’s no research that proves that guns make campuses safer.  Help prevent gun violence by asking your college president to publicly affirm on the record that they will not allow guns on your campus.  Take a photo of you flexing your arm and post on social media (tagging your college president with #GunsOut) saying that the only guns you want on campus are the ones you can flex.  Sign up for Guns Out and we’ll provide you with an official letter from our partners The Campaign to Keep Guns off Campus to help pressure state legislators when bills are proposed in the future  and more tools and information about gun violence prevention on college campuses. dosomething.org/gunsout	LER	photo	86.46	98.55	6.41	6.73	23.60	22.03	0.85	2.54	0.85	0.00	0.00	1.69	1.69	0.85	0.00	0.85	0.85	0.85	0.85	0.00	5.08	0.00	6.78	0.85	2.54	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00
