The Possible Presidential Candidate Who Agrees the Most with Pope Francis - Elizabeth Dias  TIME: http://time.com/3661552/bernie-sanders-pope-francis/  Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders is Jewish. He’s also the likely 2016 presidential candidate whose political philosophy lines up most closely with the economic and social theories of Pope Francis.  As he mused on the possibility of a 2016 campaign during an hour-long visit to TIME’s Washington Bureau Thursday  Sanders hit the Pope’s main talking points before even mentioning his name. Health care as a universal right for the elderly. The economic injustices of income inequality. Climate change.  Unlike many leaders who name-drop Pope Francis to score political points—he is  after all  likely the most popular man on the planet—Sanders quotes the Pope because he actually believes his message. When asked about casino capitalism  Sanders points to Pope Francis  who says that is not what human life should be. “He’s saying  you know what…the economy should serve people  not people serving the economy ” Sanders explains. “The market is the billionaire class who want to get richer  that is what it is. I don’t think we should have an economy serving their needs.”  Continue reading here: http://time.com/3661552/bernie-sanders-pope-francis/	HER	link	85.50	88.19	1.91	61.73	16.23	25.59	1.90	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	1.90	1.42	2.37	3.79	0.47	2.37	0.00	0.95	0.00	1.42	0.47	3.79	0.95	0.00	0.00	0.95	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00

Fight for Our Progressive Vision - Sen. Bernie Sanders  The Huffington Post:  As I look ahead to this coming year  a number of thoughts come to mind.  First and foremost  against an enormous amount of corporate media noise and distraction  it is imperative that we not lose sight of what is most important and the vision that we stand for. We have got to stay focused on those issues that impact the lives of tens of millions of Americans who struggle every day to keep their heads above water economically  and who worry deeply about the kind of future their kids will have.  Yes. We make no apologies in stating that the great moral  economic and political issue of our time is the growing level of income and wealth inequality in our nation. It is a disgrace to everything this country is supposed to stand for when the top one-tenth of 1 percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent  and when one family (the Waltons) owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent. No. The economy is not sustainable when the middle class continues to disappear and when 95 percent of all new income generated since the Wall Street crash goes to the top 1 percent. In order to create a vibrant economy  working families need disposable income. That is often not the case today.

The massive turnout on the eve of a UN General Assembly meeting showed widespread support for bold government action to reverse global warming.

The Vermont independent’s compromise with House Veterans’ Affairs Chairman Jeff Miller  R-Fla.  would provide $17 billion to the agency with $5 billion offset with savings and fees elsewhere.

The Declaration of Independence: A Revolutionary Document - By Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)  As we celebrate this July 4th weekend  it's important that we not forget the profound vision embodied in the Declaration of Independence.  "We hold these truths to be self-evident  that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are Life  Liberty  and the pursuit of Happiness; that  to secure these rights  governments are instituted among Men  deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed; that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends  it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it  and to institute new government  laying its foundation on such principles  and organizing its powers in such form  as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness."  Today  while the very rich become richer  the poor become poorer and the middle class disappears  the top 1% owns more wealth than the bottom 90%  and 95% of all new income goes to the top 1%.  Today  in terms of life expectancy  poverty has become a death sentence. With better health care  education and nutrition  the top 1% has seen an increase in their longevity. They now live 12 years longer than the people at the bottom of the economic ladder  people who are actually seeing a decline in how long they live.

An Attack on Workers:  The Supreme Court ruled against a union that had collected fees from workers who were not members but nevertheless benefited from better pay and working conditions that the union negotiated. The case decided on Monday involved home-care workers in Illinois whose hourly wages rose from $7 in 2003 to $13 in 2014. The workers also received health insurance paid for by the state and other benefits. The state and taxpayers benefited by paying less for home care than it would have cost to put people in expensive institutional care.  Sen. Bernie Sanders called the court decision “another attack on the rights of workers to collectively bargain for higher wages and decent benefits.” The decision by Justice Samuel Alito Jr.  and four other extreme right-wing Republicans “is another attack on the rights of workers to collectively bargain for higher wages and decent benefits.” It could have been worse  Sanders noted. The ruling did not go as far as some worker advocates had feared so other public-sector employees may still have an effective voice at the bargaining table.  Supreme Court analyst Jeffrey Toobin warned that it still could get worse. Writing for The New Yorker  Toobin said the conservative court has a pattern of first deciding a case in a “narrow” way but then using a decision as a precedent to move the law in a more dramatic  conservative direction in a subsequent case.

The Week in Review   Are Republicans listening to warnings from scientists about global warming? While many in Congress write off climate change as a hoax  it turns out some leading Republican figures are beginning to take the problem seriously.

Speculators Use Iraq to Drive Up Oil and Gas Prices:  Sen. Bernie Sanders accused oil companies and Wall Street speculators of using unrest in Iraq as a phony excuse to artificially drive up crude oil and gasoline prices. The price of oil rose on Thursday above $115 a barrel – a new nine-month high on the New York Mercantile Exchange – ostensibly because of concerns that sectarian violence in Iraq could cut off the country's exports. The price of regular gasoline rose to $3.67 a gallon on Thursday  up a nickel in the past month  according to gasbuddy.com. That was despite the fact that today there is more supply and less demand for gasoline than five years ago  when the average price of a gallon of gas was just $2.67 a gallon.

BREAKING: Senate Passes Sanders-McCain Veterans Bill:   The Senate today voted nearly unanimously for a bill to expand hospitals and clinics run by the Department of Veterans Affairs and to hire more doctors and nurses to provide timely  quality care for veterans.   The bipartisan bill by Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) would let veterans facing long delays for doctor appointments at VA facilities go elsewhere. Their measure also would hold VA officials accountable for trying to conceal patient wait times.  “Our job is to make certain that every veteran in the country gets quality health care in a timely manner ” Sanders said. “At a time when 2 million more veterans have come into the VA in the last four years  we must ensure that there are enough doctors  nurses and other health care professionals to meet the needs of veterans in every facility in the country.”  Read more here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-passes-sanders-mccain-veterans-bill #VA #Veterans #Vote4Vets 	HER	link	95.98	67.52	14.96	68.66	19.56	26.70	2.27	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.57	2.27	1.14	2.27	0.57	0.00	0.57	0.57	1.70	0.57	10.80	0.57	0.00	0.00	1.14	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  The Great Recession: Employers hired 217 000 workers in May  the Labor Department reported on Friday  enough to finally lift total payrolls above where they were before the financial collapse nearly six years ago. “The American people don’t feel it ” Sen. Bernie Sanders told radio host Ed Schultz. “The truth is that many of the new jobs that are being created are low-wage jobs and they are part-time jobs” that pay too little to sustain even a modest living standard  the senator said. He renewed his call for Congress to create millions of good-paying jobs by rebuilding America’s crumbling infrastructure and developing green energy sources like wind and solar power.  May Unemployment at 12.2%: The Labor Department reported on Friday that unemployment was 12.2 percent in May  according to a measurement that counts workers forced to settle for part-time jobs and others who gave up looking for work. A more widely-reported calculation by the Bureau of Labor Statistics put the jobless rate at 6.3 percent in May. That number understates the problem  the Washington Examiner reported.  Sanders-McCain Bill: Sens. Sanders and John McCain agreed on the framework for a bipartisan veterans’ bill  Time magazine  the Rutland Herald and Democracy Now! reported. White House senior advisor John Podesta  speaking at a forum broadcast on C-SPAN  called the Sanders-McCain bill “a much better way to go than privatizing our veterans’ health care.” Their bill would give the VA more power to fire wayward managers while providing civil servants a week-long period to appeal dismissals  Fox News reported.

Mr. Shinseki Takes the Fall - The New York Times:   The resignation of Secretary Eric Shinseki from the Veterans Affairs Department was probably unavoidable  under the principle that a leader should accept full responsibility for a great scandal. But the department’s problem was not Mr. Shinseki. It has been broken for years. No one should expect his removal to be anything but the beginning of a much-needed process of change.  Time now to tune out the noise from the lawmakers who lately have been baying for Mr. Shinseki’s head. No doubt they will keep heaping abuse on President Obama  on the campaign trail  and at the hearings for whoever is nominated as Mr. Shinseki’s replacement. Empty posturing in support of troops and veterans is a staple of political life  and is far easier than actually helping veterans.  This should not distract anyone from the long list of things that need doing at Veterans Affairs.  It starts with completing the investigation into what happened at the hospital in Phoenix and  evidently  many other parts of the department’s sprawling health care system. Veterans Affairs’ acting inspector general  Richard Griffin  is on the job: a preliminary report he released on Wednesday showed evidence of wide-scale mismanagement  not just in shutting out 1 700 veterans in Phoenix through fraudulent appointment records but in the “systemic” use of “inappropriate scheduling practices” at hospitals across the country. Policies that rewarded the appearance of efficiency  and thus encouraged fraud  need to be repaired  wrongdoers need to be prosecuted  and veterans who have languished must be fast-tracked into care.

Perspective:  Sen. Bernie Sanders called it “unacceptable” that some veterans are forced to wait too long for care at Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals and clinics. And he said it was “totally intolerable” that some VA employees may be manipulating records to hide how long veterans really have to wait to see doctors. But he also offered some perspective on the situation as chairman of both the Senate veterans committee and a subcommittee on primary care. He has warned for years that the nation’s entire health care system is facing a crisis in primary care. Merritt Hawkins  a health care consulting firm  found this year that the average wait time to see a family physician in 15 markets studied was 19.5 days. That’s longer than the VA’s goal of 14 days. Sanders is the chief sponsor of legislation that the Senate debated in in February that would have expanded the department’s health system with 27 new facilities.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders:   Postal Service: Republicans are moving to end door-to-door mail delivery at the U.S. Postal Service instead of eliminating a burdensome mandate that requires the agency to prefund retiree benefits for decades. Sen. Sanders told The Ed Show on MSNBC the Postal Service would “make about a billion dollars in profit” this year without the prefunding mandate. “If you want to save the Postal Service  you get rid of that burden  not prevent people from getting door-to-door delivery ” Sanders said.   VA Health Care: The Department of Veterans Affairs inspector general said veterans using a Phoenix VA hospital were inappropriately kept on unofficial waiting lists. Sen. Bernie Sanders  who leads the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee  called the inspector general's interim findings "unacceptable" but didn't join in calls for VA Secretary Eric Shinseki to step down. He urged Shinseki to immediately implement the inspector general’s recommendations  The Washington Post and New York Daily News reported.   Nuclear Safety: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission rejected calls from U.S. senators and watchdog groups to move spent nuclear fuel from storage pools into safer  sturdier dry casks  the Cape Cod Times reported.  The commission's vote prompted a response from Sens. Sanders  Barbara Boxer and Ed Markey  who have proposed legislation that would give plant owners 180 days to put together plans for moving spent fuel rods from wet pools to dry casks  according to an Associated Press report in the Brattleboro Reformer.   President to Act on Carbon Pollution: President Obama will use his executive authority to cut carbon emissions from the nation’s coal-fired power plants by up to 20 percent  according to people familiar with his plans  and will force industry to pay for the pollution it creates through cap-and-trade programs across the country. Obama will unveil his plans in a new regulation  written by the Environmental Protection Agency  at the White House on Monday  according to The New York Times.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Veterans in War of Words with Burr: Leery that veterans may be pushed into an inferior private health care system  veterans groups engaged in a brutal war of words over the Memorial Day weekend with Sen. Richard Burr  the ranking Republican on the Senate Veterans Affairs’ Committee. Relations between veterans and Senate Republicans have been strained since Republicans blocked a vote on broad veterans legislation by Sen. Bernard Sanders  the committee chairman  that would have bolstered health and dental care  authorized 27 new clinics and improved veterans education programs  The New York Times reported.  VA Health Care: Sen. Sanders will introduce legislation after the Memorial Day break that will improve accountability at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs  according to an Associated Press report published on Tuesday in The (Nashua  New Hampshire) Telegraph and the Times Argus. In many cases under current law  such officials can only be dismissed for misconduct. But Sanders said that unlike the House version passed on Wednesday  his bill would keep some due-process protections for VA managers and would prohibit politically motivated firings  Reuters reported on Tuesday.   VA Health Care: First it was Social Security  then Medicare and Medicaid  then the public health care option under Obamacare. Now  Republicans are calling for the privatization of the Veterans Health Administration  which provides cost-effective and high quality care to 6.2 million veterans. It is of course unacceptable if patients suffered as a result of any delays. And as Sen. Sanders said  "It's imperative that we uncover the problems that exist and address them boldly." But regardless of what went wrong at any VA facility  turning veterans over to private sector insurers and for-profit hospitals is not the solution  Suzanne Gordon wrote in a column for The Boston Globe.  Memorial Day: Sen. Sanders will introduce legislation to address performance problems in the Department of Veterans Affairs after the Senate’s Memorial Day recess. "We want to make sure that the administrators are accountable " Sanders told reporters after the Memorial Day parade in Vergennes  Vermont  in which he marched. "We want to make sure that nobody is fudging the books or running two sets of books in terms of access to VA health care ” he told WPTZ-TV  WVNY-TV  WFFF-TV and New England Cable News.

Memorial Day:  On this Memorial Day  Sen. Bernie Sanders thanked  all veterans who have put their lives on the line to defend our country and especially the families of those who paid the ultimate sacrifice. "Congress must reaffirm its commitment to make sure that every veteran in this country and their families get the health care and other benefits that they have earned and deserve." added Sanders  chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee.  "During the past several years  we have made significant progress. We have expanded education and employment opportunities  reduced homelessness  improved the processing of claims for disability benefits and given new support for the caregivers of disabled veterans. In the coming year  I look forward to working with veterans all across the country and their representatives here in Washington as we redouble our commitment to the men and women who have given so much for our nation ” the chairman said.  http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/chairman-sanders-statement-on-memorial-day	HER	link	87.83	91.44	15.38	92.40	21.00	33.33	4.76	0.60	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.60	1.19	0.60	0.00	4.76	0.60	0.60	0.60	0.60	4.76	2.98	7.74	3.57	0.60	0.00	0.60	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Veterans Benefits: Sen. Bernie Sanders announced Friday that he will introduce a bill to hold top VA officials accountable and re-introduce comprehensive legislation to expand veterans benefits. The Senate Veterans Affairs Committee chairman is working with the White House to draft the accountability proposal  The Washington Post and Wall Street Journal reported. “Everybody has to be held accountable. I do not want to see an enormous amount of paperwork … before we can get rid of incompetent people ” Sanders said Saturday on the CBS Morning News.   Media Matters: While mainstream media coverage of allegations of improper practices at certain Department of Veterans Affairs health clinics has been extensive in recent weeks  the bill by Sen. Sanders to expand health care for veterans that was blocked by Senate Republicans in February received little attention  according to an analysis by the news watchdog Media Matters. It said that broadcast network evening news shows completely ignored Republicans blocking the veterans health legislation.   VA Management: Unlike a House version passed on Wednesday  Sen. Sanders said his bill would keep some due-process protections for VA managers and would prohibit politically motivated firings  according to a Reuters report in the Chicago Tribune and other newspapers.

Save Net Neutrality:   In a Senate floor speech Tuesday  Sen. Bernie Sanders read some of the more than 19 000 comments that consumers sent through his Senate website to the Federal Communications Commission demanding a free and open Internet. Sanders also urged President Barack Obama to reassert his support for net neutrality  a stand Obama took when he first ran for the White House in 2008.  After the FCC signaled it would consider new rules governing the Internet  Sanders invited visitors to use a form on his Senate website to weigh in on what he called a “terribly misguided” proposal. The FCC is considering a policy that would let companies like Comcast and Verizon divide the Internet into fast and slow lanes and give major corporations a significant advantage over small Internet startups and grassroots political organizations.

Who Are the Koch Brothers?  On Tuesday  Sen. Bernie Sanders went to the Senate floor to answer the questions: Who are the Koch brothers and what do they want?  Sanders answered the questions by examining the failed party platform of David Koch’s 1980 vice-presidential campaign.  “Many Americans know that the Koch brothers want to repeal the Affordable Care Act ” said Sanders. “But what most Americans probably do not know is that the Koch brothers want to repeal virtually every major piece of legislation that has helped working families  the elderly  the sick  and the poor over the past 80 years.”  Watch the speech here: http://youtu.be/B5tAT6ciJ4s	HER	video	93.67	73.78	8.41	13.47	15.71	22.73	1.82	2.73	0.00	0.00	0.91	6.36	0.00	2.73	4.55	0.91	1.82	0.91	1.82	0.00	5.45	1.82	5.45	0.00	0.91	0.00	0.91	0.00	0.00	0.00	1.82	0.00

Congress Must Confront Global Warming Crisis:   Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) called for Congress to act on proposals to curb greenhouse gas emissions after a major new report today warned that global warming could exceed 10 degrees Fahrenheit in the United States by the end of this century.  “This important report is another loud and clear warning that greenhouse gases are rising faster than ever and our refusal to recognize and deal with the crisis could have catastrophic consequences ” said Sanders  a member of the Senate energy and environment committees.  “It is no longer acceptable for a majority in Congress to ignore the overwhelming scientific evidence. It is no longer acceptable that coal and oil companies spend millions of dollars to defeat efforts to protect the planet ” Sanders added.

Tops on Twitter and Facebook Too:  Time magazine selected Sen. Bernie Sanders for its annual list of the “most influential Twitter feeds.” Said Time  “He’s a loud conscience for liberal principles. He highlights poverty statistics  tweaks his colleagues for voting against veterans’ benefits and slams the industrialist Koch brothers for their political spending. At a time when political and economic populism has grown in fits and starts  Sanders is a voice consistently railing against inequality.” When it comes to social media  The Washington Post Wonkblog last week reported that Sanders “has one of the largest and most enthusiastic social media followings out there.” The Post called it “astonishing” that nearly 30 times as many people were engaged with Sanders’ Facebook page than were interacting at the same time with Rep. Paul Ryan  the Republicans’ 2012 VP candidate. Sanders said the credit goes to people like you who are concerned about the future of our country and understand that we need a serious discussion about serious issues.  “Let's keep the serious discussions going and get even more friends  family and coworkers involved in the dialogue.”  Read the Time list here: http://time.com/84178/bernie-sanders-twitter-feeds-follow-2014/  Read more at Wonkblog here: http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/04/28/congressional-republicans-have-more-facebook-fans-but-democrats-are-more-energized/	HER	link	90.42	91.38	12.50	41.71	20.64	29.07	2.20	1.32	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.44	0.00	0.44	1.32	0.00	2.20	0.00	1.76	0.00	7.05	0.00	3.52	1.32	0.00	0.00	2.20	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00

Pfizer Avoids US Taxes: Drugs giant Pfizer will face a grilling today from U.S. shareholders over its takeover bid for Britain’s AstraZeneca. The acquisition is aimed at moving Pfizer’s tax domicile to the United Kingdom in order to deprive U.S. coffers of billions of dollars. Sen. Sanders put Pfizer on a list of ‘Top Ten Corporate Tax Avoiders ’ claiming it paid no income taxes from 2010 to 2012 and that it received $2.2billion of tax refunds from the IRS at the same time as making $43 billion in worldwide profit  London’s Daily Mail reported.   Keystone Pipeline Looms as Senate Takes up Energy Bill: The impassioned debate over the Keystone XL pipeline could reach a tipping point this week on Capitol Hill  with this likely the last chance for the issue to be considered legislatively until after the November midterm elections. The outcome could complicate matters for the Obama administration  which is still reviewing whether to allow permits for sections of the pipeline. The Senate is set to begin debate on a modest energy bill that has enough bipartisan support to pass on its own merits  but supporters of the pipeline  which is intended to transport oil from western Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast  are trying to leverage the bill to force votes on Keystone  The Washington Post reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Senate Republicans Block Minimum Wage Bill: Senate Republicans on Wednesday blocked a bill that would gradually increase the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $10.10 an hour. “It really does astound me that at a time when our Republican friends in the house are voting to give huge tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires and large corporations  they don't have it in their hearts to give us at least a $10.10 minimum wage  which would take so many people out of poverty ” Sen. Bernie Sanders told MSNBC.   Phoenix VA: Department of Veterans Affairs officials told senators Wednesday that the investigation into allegations of a secret waiting list for medical appointments at the Phoenix VA so far has turned up no evidence that such a list exists. Veterans Committee Chairman Sanders vowed to “get to the bottom of what has happened in Phoenix ” while reaching conclusions “based on an objective investigation of the facts — not TV reports.” Sanders said the allegations should not be allowed "to impugn excellent work done throughout this country by hundreds of thousands of doctors  nurses and administrators on all levels” at the VA  The Associated Press reported.   Senate to Vote on Campaign Finance Amendment: A string of Supreme Court decisions  starting in with a 2010 ruling in Citizens United vs. the FEC  enabled the nation's wealthiest donors to anonymously contribute unlimited amounts of money to influence elections. Sen. Chuck Schumer on Wednesday promised to hold a Senate vote this year on a constitutional amendment to allow restrictions on campaign spending. It is unclear if any potential presidential candidates will run on the issue in the 2016 election. So far  only Sen. Sanders has indicated that he would campaign heavily against the influence of big donors and corporate interests in politics  The Boston Globe reported.

For years  net neutrality has prohibited big Internet corporations from favoring or blocking certain viewpoints or websites. Our free and open Internet has made invaluable contributions to democracy both here in the United States and around the world. Whether you are rich  poor  young or old  the Internet allows all people to seek out information and communicate globally.  Federal Communications Commissioner Tom Wheeler reportedly plans to vote on a rule change that would undermine the principles of net neutrality and let companies like Comcast and Verizon divide the internet into fast and slow lanes. This proposal would end the Internet as we know it. We must not let private corporations turn bigger and bigger profits by putting a price tag on the free flow of ideas.

Minimum-Wage Plan on Senate Agenda: The Senate is expected this week to take up a long-stalled push to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour  a measure that is likely to be defeated but one that Democrats see as a winner on the campaign trail. The idea of raising the $7.25-an-hour minimum wage is politically popular  according to polls  but Republicans hope the coming debate will allow them to promote their view that raising the wage will lead to job losses.

Federal Election Commission decision earlier this month.

Princeton Study: U.S. No Longer An Actual Democracy - Brendan James  Talking Points Memo:   A new study from Princeton spells bad news for American democracy—namely  that it no longer exists.  Asking "[w]ho really rules?" researchers Martin Gilens and Benjamin I. Page argue that over the past few decades America's political system has slowly transformed from a democracy into an oligarchy  where wealthy elites wield most power.  Using data drawn from over 1 800 different policy initiatives from 1981 to 2002  the two conclude that rich  well-connected individuals on the political scene now steer the direction of the country  regardless of or even against the will of the majority of voters.  "The central point that emerges from our research is that economic elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on U.S. government policy " they write  "while mass-based interest groups and average citizens have little or no independent influence."  As one illustration  Gilens and Page compare the political preferences of Americans at the 50th income percentile to preferences of Americans at the 90th percentile as well as major lobbying or business groups. They find that the government—whether Republican or Democratic—more often follows the preferences of the latter group rather than the first.

These billionaires already own much of our economy. That  apparently  is not enough. Now  they want to own the United States government as well.

'Their Nightmare'  With more than 7 million Americans signing up for health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act  critics who predicted its collapse are instead dealing with “their worst nightmare ” Sen. Bernie Sanders said on Monday.  “First  the United States remains the only country in the industrialized world that doesn’t guarantee health care to all of its people as a right. Second of all  the Republicans have opposed the Affordable Care Act from day one – it is their nightmare that it succeeds. Thirdly these are the same guys that want to end Medicare as we know it  convert it into a voucher program  who want to make massive cuts in Medicaid  who had eight years under Bush to do something – even a little thing – about health care  they did nothing. So these guys have nothing at all to say. And their nightmare is as millions of people begin to get affordable health care  as the Medicaid program expands and people who never had health insurance in their lives finally are able to go into a doctor – for the Republicans this is a nightmare. Imagine that the United States government does something for ordinary people and not just for billionaires – what kind of nightmare is that? That is their fear  Ed ” Sanders said in an interview with Ed Schultz on MSNBC.

The prohibition is similar to language in a Senate bill aimed at closing a pay gap between men and women. That legislation is scheduled for a vote this week  though it is not likely to pass. In addition  Obama on Tuesday will direct the Labor Department to adopt regulations requiring federal contractors to provide compensation data based on sex and race  The Associated Press reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Senate Expected to Pass Unemployment Bill: The Senate is expected to pass legislation on Monday that would restore long-term unemployment benefits that were allowed to expire in December  but the bill may be dead-on-arrival in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. “This is something that is desperately needed from a moral point of view. What we also know economically is that when you put money in the hands of people who are going to spend it  it creates jobs ” Sanders said Friday on The Thom Hartmann Program. “So this is a twofer.”    Sanders: Court Decision ‘Dead Wrong’: The Supreme Court removed the cap on the total amount of money donors can contribute to candidates and parties in each election. "They are dead wrong " Sen. Sanders said in an interview broadcast Friday on Vermont Public Radio. “The court decision “is freedom for a handful of the wealthiest people in this country to undermine American democracy and to buy elections ” lamented Sanders in Sunday editions of The New York Times. On The Thom Hartmann Program  Sanders called for a grassroots movement to pass a constitutional amendment that would overturn the ruling and others like it. “[W]e need our ordinary citizens to be extraordinary citizens.”  Rich Republicans Unshackled: Sen. Sanders hit the nail on the head this week when he said  “Freedom of speech  in my view  does not mean the freedom to buy the United States government ” Angelo Lynn wrote in an Addison County Independent editorial. Sanders told Amy Goodman Wednesday's McCutcheon decision grants "freedom for a handful of the wealthiest people in this country to undermine American democracy and to buy elections " Truthout and Truthdig reported.  In a letter to The Union of Grass Valley  Calif.  Michelle Spencer quoted Sanders saying "a handful of self-serving right-wing billionaires have the capability of spending more money on the political process than everyone else combined." From the right  National Review ranked a Sanders speech on the ruling the top "outburst" of “left-wing.”  Broadband in Vermont: Colleges  public libraries  health care providers and schools are among more than 400 community institutions throughout rural Vermont that now have fiber-optic broadband connections. Two Vermont companies won federal economic stimulus grants to complete the project. Students and teachers are among the Vermonters who are benefiting. "Vermont may be on the verge of reaping enormous dividends from this historic investment in our future " Sen. Sanders said in Saturday’s Bennington Banner. "The ultra-fast Internet offers the chance to dramatically change how we think about education  health care and business."

The Week in Review:  The Supreme Court on Wednesday handed the wealthy more power to spend more money and have more influence on who wins elections. After a very rocky rollout  there were very impressive results by a midnight Monday deadline when more than 7 million Americans signed up for health care under the Affordable Care Act. The March jobs report issued Friday by the Labor Department showed the number of Americans out of work six months or more is twice as high as before the recession began in 2007. The latest jobless numbers bolster the case for Congress to extend benefits that expired late last for the long-term unemployed.

Real Unemployment at 12.7%:  The official unemployment rate for March was 6.7 percent  unchanged from February  but real unemployment ticked up to 12.7 percent  the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced on Friday. That number counts workers forced to settle for part-time jobs and those unemployed for so long that they have given up looking for work. The Senate is expected to vote Monday to resurrect benefits that expired last Dec. 28 for the long-term jobless. “This will impact several million American workers who are at the end of their ropes financially ” Sanders said. Passing the bill is “the morally right thing to do” and “good economics ” the senator added  but he cautioned that the measure faces an uncertain fate in the Republican-run House.  This bill to extend long-term emergency unemployment benefits for 2.2 million Americans would restore benefits that expired nearly three months ago.The benefits  about $300 a week on average  help jobless workers fill up their gas tank to get to a job interview  feed their families  pay the rent and heat their homes.  Each  week that the Congress fails to act  an additional 72 000 Americans are losing their unemployment benefits. Today  about 4 million Americans who are currently looking for a job have been unemployed for more than 6 months. In the wake of a slow recovery from the recession that began in 2007  long-term unemployment is near a 60-year high.  House Speaker John Boehner and other Republicans today oppose extending the benefits  but when George W. Bush was President  Republicans  including Boehner  voted for emergency unemployment benefits five times  Now that Barack Obama is in the White House  many congressional Republicans oppose extending these benefits. Since 1958  Congress has never failed to pass emergency unemployment benefits when long-term unemployment has been as high as it is today. Today  there are nearly three job applicants for every one job opening.  There simply aren’t enough jobs out there for the more than 10 million Americans who are actively seeking work.  The long-term unemployment rate today is more than double what it’s been at any other time Congress has let emergency jobless assistance expire. For example  hundreds of people applied last month to work at a Sam’s Club in Oxford  Ala.  that won’t be opening until August. In January  more than 5 000 people waited in line for just 1 500 jobs at an outlet mall in Palm Beach  Fla. That same month  1 600 people in Hagerstown  Md.  applied for just 36 job openings at a dairy farm to process milk and ice cream. Last December  10 000 people applied for just 750 flight attendant jobs at Southwest Airlines and more than 23 000 Americans applied for just 600 jobs at Wal-Mart in Washington  DC.  If Congress fails to extend emergency unemployment benefits  240 000 American workers will lose their jobs by the end of this year. The overall economy will be hurt because when people lose their unemployment benefits  they don’t go to the grocery store  they don’t buy clothes  they don’t go to the pharmacy.  Businesses lose customers  they lose money  and they fire even more people.

Sanders Calls for Public Funding of Campaigns: This week’s Supreme Court decision and earlier rulings striking down laws that limited campaign donations are a “terrible disservice to the American people ” Sen. Sanders told MSNBC on Thursday. The solution  Sanders said  is public funding of elections “so that all candidates have a fair shot at getting elected  and they can be judged by their ideas  by what they're fighting for  and not by the bank accounts of their campaign sponsors." Sanders has introduced a constitutional amendment that would undo a series of court rulings and restore the power of Congress and state lawmakers to ban corporate contributions and limit individual donations  Vermont Public Radio reported.  Court Undermines Democracy: Sen. Sanders denounced the ruling from the Supreme Court’s five conservative justices that struck down individual campaign contribution limits  Slate  PoliticusUSA  The (Madison  Wis.) Capotal Times  World Net Daily  and the Baltimore Post-Examiner reported. Sanders told Democracy Now! that the ruling is "an outrage to the struggles that people have undertaken in this country for democracy.” Republicans cheered the ruling  which Sanders criticized in a series of radio interviews Thursday on The Joe Piscopo Show  The Randi Rhodes Show and The Stephanie Miller Show. The decision  Sanders said on KTRH-AM in Houston  Texas and WHIO-AM in Dayton  Ohio  would enable billionaires to “buy elections.”  Vermont Election Law Voided: Wednesday’s decision in the McCutcheon case triggered a provision invalidating in a new Vermont campaign funding law that would have limited individual donations  according to a Vt.

Sanders called the ruling “totally absurd.”    Continue reading today's news: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/040414	HER	link	96.40	70.77	8.05	18.74	17.54	31.35	1.19	1.66	0.48	0.71	0.00	1.43	0.95	1.19	0.24	0.48	0.48	1.19	1.19	0.24	0.71	2.14	6.89	0.71	0.24	0.00	0.48	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.24

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Supreme Court Rules for the Rich: Sen. Bernie Sanders denounced a 5-4 Supreme Court ruling on Wednesday that fundamentally undermines American democracy by striking down limits on total donations that individuals may make to political candidates and parties  the Burlington Free Press  Moyers & Company and London’s Daily Mail reported. “These five justices are working night and day to make the wealth and powerful more wealthy and more powerful ” Sanders told nationally syndicated radio host Leslie Marshall. We have to be careful that we do not let this great country … become a plutocracy or an oligarchy. That  frankly  is the direction that we are moving ” Sanders said in a Senate speech shown on WFFF-TV and WVYN-TV.  Democracy Now!: Sen. Sanders said the Supreme Court’s ruling only offers “freedom” to a handful of wealthy donors who can afford to dump more than $125 000 into campaigns. “For them to plop a few billion dollars into the political process ” Sen. Sanders told Amy Goodman in a Thursday morning interview for Democracy Now! “It’s just an outrage… I suspect in the next presidential campaign  the Koch brothers themselves will spend a billion dollars to elect the candidate of their choice.”  Court Commentary: The decision elicited strong disapproval from a host of Democrats and liberals. President Barack Obama  a spokesman said  was “disappointed ” and Sen. Sanders predicted that henceforth  “billionaires like the Koch brothers and Sheldon Adelson will control our political process ” according to a Chicago Tribune editorial. “Freedom of speech  in my view  does not mean the freedom to buy the United States government ” Sen. Sanders said in a Rutland Herald and Times Argus editorial. Writing for Politico  National Review editor Rich Lowry didn’t like the way “Sanders natters on about the decision creating ‘an oligarchic form of society.’”  Oligarchs and Plutocrats: An oligarchy is a system of "government by the few." Rooted in Greek  oligos means "few" and arch means "rule " as in monarch or hierarchy. Plutocracy has been used in English since the middle of the 17th century to refer to the rule or power of the wealthy. Pluto comes from the Greek for "wealth." Back in 1917  Theodore Roosevelt said government by a plutocracy is un-American. It took Sen. Sanders to roll both terms into one sentence in a speech railing against domestic spending cuts  he said: "This is not what democracy looks like. This is what oligarchy and plutocracy look like " the Christian Science Monitor reported.

High Court Gives Big Money More Say in Campaigns:  The Supreme Court on Wednesday struck down overall campaign contribution limits. The law that the 5-4 ruling voided has prevented individuals from contributing more than $123 000 to candidates and party committees per election cycle. Sen. Bernie Sanders  who has proposed a constitutional amendment to restore the power of Congress and state lawmakers to limit campaign donations  blasted the ruling.“Freedom of speech  in my view  does not mean the freedom to buy the United States government ” Sanders said.  The ruling gives wealthy donors like the billionaires Charles and David Koch more power to influence elections. An earlier ruling in Citizens United vs. FEC resulted in a record $7 billion being spent in the 2012 election cycle  including at least $400 million by the Koch brothers alone. “What world are the five conservative Supreme Court justices living in?” Sanders asked. “To equate the ability of billionaires to buy elections with ‘freedom of speech’ is totally absurd. The Supreme Court is paving the way toward an oligarchic form of society in which a handful of billionaires like the Koch brothers and Sheldon Adelson will control our political process.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/high-court-gives-big-money-more-say-in-campaigns #McCutcheon	HER	photo	99.00	70.83	8.56	82.85	19.91	30.14	3.65	0.46	0.00	0.00	0.46	0.46	1.37	0.00	0.46	0.46	0.91	0.46	2.28	0.46	2.28	1.37	11.42	0.00	0.46	0.00	0.46	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.46	0.00

The Long-Term Jobless:   The Senate is poised to vote next week on a bill that would  provide retroactive unemployment benefits for more than 2 million Americans who have been out of work the longest. The benefit checks were cut off last Dec. 28 when the federal program expired. “It’s a moral issue and it’s an economic issue ” Sen. Bernie Sanders told radio host Ed Schultz on Wednesday. States provide unemployment benefits  for 26 weeks. In the past  emergency federal benefits -- $287 a week on average -- have kicked in for up to 47 additional weeks. When the emergency program lapsed late last year  1.3 million people lost those benefits. Since then  about 72 000 people a week have had benefits cut off.

Spying on Americans:   President Barack Obama is crafting legislation that would stop the National Security Agency from collecting records on millions of Americans’ telephone calls. Instead  phone companies would store the records. Law enforcement officials would have to convince a judge that there is a specific reason to search the records. Meanwhile  however  the administration asked a special court that operates in secret for a 90-day extension of the NSA’s authorization to conduct the bulk collection. “The president should end that program now  not 90 days from now ” Sen. Bernie Sanders said on Tuesday. He discussed it with Ed Schultz on MSNBC.

The remaining revenue could be invested in sustainable and renewable energy like solar power and for making buildings more energy efficient. “The only way we can address climate change and get off of oil is to give families access to alternatives. We cannot produce our way to lower prices ” Public Citizen’s Tyson Slocum told the Qatar-bankrolled Al Jazeera America.

The Week in Review:   An idea that may have started with a call by Sen. Bernie Sanders to Vermont’s governor is keeping nutrition and home heating assistance flowing to people in a growing number of states. House Speaker John Boehner was fuming on Thursday over how the idea that Sanders was the first to broach with Gov. Shumlin has foiled a Republican bid to cut food stamps. Election Day on Tuesday in Illinois saw another example of widespread public support for raising the minimum wage. Also on Tuesday  Sanders was among senators signing a letter sent to President Obama urging him to issue an executive order banning workplace discrimination against gays.

Heat and Eat:   Vermont and other states have figured out a way to help some seniors and families with children avoid freezing or starving this winter. Under a so-called “Heat and Eat” provision in the food stamps program  a household is entitled to more food aid if it also is enrolled in the federally-funded Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program  which helps people pay their utility bills. Some states were making only token payments to families for home heating assistance to help them qualify for food stamps. The farm bill that Congress passed in February said states would have to pay at least $20 a year in fuel aid to prompt the food stamp benefits. Republicans assumed that states wouldn’t want to pay the extra $20 and projected that the new farm bill would result in $8.6 billion in food stamp cuts over the next decade. They were wrong.

Poverty is a Death Sentence:  Fairfax County  Va.  and McDowell County  W.Va.  are only 350 miles apart.  Suburban Fairfax County’s median family income of $107 000 is one of the highest in the United States  five times more than in rural McDowell County.

Bernie Sanders said during an all-night Senate floor discussion last week to support action to combat climate change. Excerpts from his speech were published in Sunday’s Burlington Free Press.

Poor Die Younger: Fairfax County  Va.  and McDowell County  W.Va.  are separated by 350 miles. Just outside of Washington  Fairfax County’s median family income of $107 000 is one of the highest in the nation. With the decline of coal  the median household income in McDowell is about one-fifth that of Fairfax. One of the starkest consequences of that divide is life expectancy.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Sanders: Put Americans Back to Work: “The middle class of America is collapsing … poverty is up and the rich are doing phenomenally well.

West Must Stand Up to Putin: Western leaders have resisted the use of military force to keep Russian President Vladimir Putin in check in advance of a referendum Sunday in Crimea  which is expected to secede from Ukraine and be annexed by Russia. “The entire world has got to stand up to Putin. We've got to deal with sanctions ” Sen. Sanders said in a Fox News interview. Freezing Russian assets is one possibility he suggested. “There are a number of things that you could do. But this is what you don't do. You don't go to war. You don't sacrifice lives of young people in this country as we did in Iraq and Afghanistan.”   Talks on Crimea Crisis Break Down: Talks between U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov over this weekend's referendum on Crimea joining Russia broke down after five hours Friday  as Western leaders warned that sanctions were looming  The Wall Street Journal reported.

The Week in Review:  A spunky family physician from Canada was the star witness at a Tuesday hearing about how other countries provide health care at less cost and get better outcomes than the United States. Sen. Bernie Sanders chaired the hearing. The White House would be required to submit a plan for reducing childhood poverty in the U.S. under a Sanders provision added to a bill that passed the Senate on Thursday. President Obama set the gears in place for millions more workers to get overtime pay. And senators began the week by keeping the Senate in session for all-night talk-a-thon on global warming.

Working Overtime:  President Barack Obama on Thursday called for new overtime rules so more workers will be eligible for time-and-a-half pay after putting in a 40-hour workweek. Obama’s directive to the Labor Department eventually will help millions of low-wage workers. Now  a worker on  salary of more than $455 a week with minimal management duties may be denied overtime.  Sen. Bernie Sanders applauded the president’s action. “It is absurd that millions of workers making as little as $455 a week are considered ‘supervisors’ and get no overtime pay.  I hope the Department of Labor raises that threshold to at least $1 000  which would reflect inflation since 1975. That step alone would mean a raise for millions of workers. More money in the hands of working people would mean that those workers could then go out and make purchases that would help create more jobs.”  It will take a while before workers see any more money in their paychecks. Leaving the details to be worked out by the Labor Department  Obama did not specify what the new salary thresholds should be. The department isn’t likely to propose specific language until this fall.  Workers won the right to overtime pay back in 1938  when Congress passed a law requiring extra pay for extra hours of work. Under the law  the Labor Department was given the authority to change the salary thresholds to account for inflation. The department also was given leeway to spell out which workers are eligible for overtime. The last time the rules were updated  however  was 1975. That’s when the Ford administration raised the salary threshold significantly to account for inflation.

Childhood Poverty in America:  The childhood poverty rate in the United States is greater than in any other major country. So as senators on Wednesday worked on a bill that would reauthorize a federal child care block grant  Sen. Bernie Sanders proposed an  amendment calling on President Barack Obama to submit a five-year plan to reduce childhood poverty. “The United States of America is the richest country in the history of the world. Unfortunately  despite our great wealth  more of our citizens are living in poverty than ever before and we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country in the industrialized world. We have a moral responsibility to end childhood poverty in America ” Sanders said.

With a hint of sarcasm  Sanders asked the doctor to explain how come the conservative Canadian premier hasn’t gotten rid of the country’s health care system. In another exchange  as the Los Angeles Times put it  Dr. Martin “bats down the myths and misunderstandings about the Canadian system that Burr throws at her.” Burr  for example  asked why former Newfoundland Premier Danny Williams had a heart valve operation in Miami  where he owns a condo  instead of in Canada.

What the U.S. Can Learn About Health Care from Other Countries:  Other major countries offer better health care at less cost than the United States  according to witnesses who testified on Tuesday at a Senate hearing chaired by Sen. Bernie Sanders. “What this hearing is really about is two fundamental issues. First  the U.S.  the wealthiest country on the planet  is the only major industrialized country in the world that does not guarantee health care as a right to its citizens. Should we consider joining the rest of the world? I’d argue we should ” Sanders said. “Second  the U.S. spends twice as much as other countries that have much better health outcomes. What can we learn from these countries?” asked Sanders  chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Primary Health and Aging.

Bernie Sanders told CNN on Monday.  Campaign Funding: Sen. Sanders told MSNBC’s Ronan Farrow that the United States is moving toward a government run by a few wealthy people. “The Koch brothers and Sheldon Adelson are prepared to spend hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars  if not billions  to elect the president of the United States  to elect senators  to elect governors.

Toomey Votes Against Veterans: “Despite proclaiming himself a champion of veterans and making grandiose statements about our society's obligation to take care of them  Sen. [Pat] Toomey was one of 41 Senators - all Republicans - who defeated a recent bill that would have expanded veterans' benefits … Veterans are furious. Veteran Affairs Committee Chairman Sanders said … he'd be working hard in the upcoming weeks to convince the necessary number of Republicans to reconsider their votes. We urge Sen. Toomey to distinguish himself and honor his commitment to military veterans by being one of the Republicans who does just that ” The Philadelphia Daily News editorialized.   Long-Term Unemployment: Both Democrats and Republicans offered up fresh proposals this week that would renew emergency unemployment insurance for the long-term jobless  injecting another batch of uncertainty into the debate. Democrats’ six-month proposal would use a large portion of the farm law’s savings to cover the $12 billion price tag  an unpopular option among Republicans. The Republican plan would combine several offsets to pay for a $10-billion  five-month measure that includes some program reforms.  Both bills would extend benefits retroactively to Dec. 28  when long-term unemployment insurance expired  The Hill reported.

Kirsten Gillibrand to give professional military trial lawyers the power to refer serious crimes to courts-martial.  "An estimated 26 000 service members were sexually assaulted in 2012  a 37 percent increase in just one year  according to a recent Department of Defense study. I voted for Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand’s bill because it would give servicemen and women an independent route outside the chain of command to report serious crimes  and I am disappointed that it was defeated " Sen. Bernie Sanders said after a key Senate vote.

There's No Need to End Saturday Mail Delivery - Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   The U.S. Postal Service is one of our most popular and important government agencies. It provides universal service six days a week to every corner of America  no matter how small or remote. It supports millions of jobs in virtually every other sector of our economy. It provides decent-paying union jobs to some 500 000 Americans  and it is the largest employer of veterans.  Whether you are a low-income elderly woman living at the end of a dirt road in Vermont or a wealthy CEO living on Park Avenue  you get your mail six days a week. And you pay for this service at a cost far less than anywhere else in the industrialized world.  Yet the Postal Service is under constant and vicious attack. Why? The answer is simple. There are very powerful and wealthy special interests who want to privatize or dismember virtually every function that government now performs  whether it is Social Security  Medicare  public education or the Postal Service. They see an opportunity for Wall Street and corporate America to make billions in profits out of these services  and couldn't care less how privatization or a degradation of services affects ordinary Americans.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Obama Budget: President Obama on Tuesday sent Congress a $3.9 trillion budget that seeks to boost economic growth and reduce the national debt by raising taxes on the rich. Sen. Bernie Sanders told The Ed Schultz Show that the president’s proposals would provide major investments in creating jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure  expanding community health centers and improving the lives and educational opportunities of our children.   Obama Retreats on Social Security: Cuts Obama dropped a proposal to change the way inflation is calculated for Social Security and other federal benefits. The budget also contains significant tax increases on the wealthy  tax cuts for the working class and $56 billion in increased spending above the 2015 budget cap. “At a time when the wealthiest Americans are doing phenomenally well  [the budget] asks some of the richest people in the country to start paying their fair share of taxes ” said Sen. Sanders said in The Hill. PoliticusUSA noted that Sanders welcomed Obama’s decision to drop proposed cuts to Social Security.   VA Budget: Veterans groups say the proposed Department of Veterans Affairs budget fails to address construction and maintenance needs at VA facilities across the country.

A provision in a comprehensive veterans' bill by Sen. Sanders would have provided funding for leases to 27 facilities across the U.S. and Puerto Rico. But that bill failed last month in a partisan vote  military.com reported.

The Forbes World's Billionaires List:   Forbes magazine on Monday came out with its annual ranking of the world’s richest people. Among the top 10 billionaires were three men who have put vast sums into swaying the outcomes of American elections. Charles and David Koch  with fortunes that Forbes’ pegged at $40 Billion each  were the sixth richest people in the world. Las Vegas gambling tycoon Sheldon Adelson came in eighth. The Koch brothers and Adelson have played growing roles in bankrolling favored politicians since the Supreme Court in 2010 struck down limits on campaign spending. “Because of this disastrous Supreme Court decision in Citizens United  a bad situation—and it’s been bad for a while—has become much worse ” Sen. Bernie Sanders said in an Truthdig interview.  Sanders also talked about how big money controls Congress. “Despite the fact that we have a collapsing middle class  more people living in poverty than at any time during our history  and the gap between the very  very rich and everyone else growing wider  it is very hard for me to imagine significant legislation being passed that Wall Street and the big money interests don’t want ” the senator told Truthdig’s Alexander Reed Kelly.

The 99-0 vote clears the way for a Senate debate on the bill by Sen. Bernie Sanders  chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs.  “We have made progress but we still have a long way to go if we are to keep faith with those who have put their lives on the line to defend us ” Sanders said in a Senate floor speech before the vote. “I hope very much that we will go down that road together  that we will tell the American people that at least on this one issue we can stand together and protect the interests of those people who have sacrificed so much for our country.”  After the vote  Sanders reacted to Republican senators who want to inject a debate over Iran sanctions into the measure on veterans programs. “We can have honest differences on how to address veterans issues  but it is disrespectful to the millions of veterans in this country to introduce an extraneous provision on Iran sanctions ” Sanders said. “The American people have had enough of silly partisan politics. Let’s focus on veterans issues.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/veterans-bill-clears-senate-hurdle	HER	link	93.67	90.41	25.87	75.85	22.20	23.87	3.15	0.45	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	1.35	1.35	0.90	0.00	2.25	0.00	1.35	0.00	5.41	0.90	9.46	0.90	0.90	0.00	0.45	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00

An End to the Grand-Bargain Charades - The New York Times:  The phony budget games finally came to an end this week.   After years of trying to entice Republicans into serious negotiations over a fiscal deal — years of instant rejection and painful austerity — the White House announced it was giving up.  In President Obama’s 2015 budget  scheduled to be unveiled next month  there will be no more proposals to cut entitlement programs. Instead  the president will demand what the country needs the most: new investments in education  in energy efficiency  in job training. When Republicans turn away  as they will  they will have to explain to voters why they prefer tax loopholes for the rich over programs to create jobs and rebuild the economy.  Mr. Obama will not include an offer that marred his 2014 budget plan: reducing the cost-of-living increase for Social Security in exchange for higher spending and the end of some of those loopholes. The Social Security cut  known as a “chained” Consumer Price Index  was never a good idea. It was likely to hurt vulnerable retirees  but had been long advocated by the right. Nonetheless  Republicans refused to consider that change if it meant touching the tax breaks of their wealthiest donors  so they passed up a chance to achieve their stated goal of reducing entitlement spending.  “Over the course of last year  Republicans consistently showed a lack of willingness to negotiate on a deficit-reduction deal ” a White House official said  “refusing to identify even one unfair tax loophole they would be willing to close  despite the president’s willingness to put tough things on the table.”  Continue reading here: http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/22/opinion/an-end-to-the-grand-bargain-charades.html?_r=1	HER	link	97.67	64.55	28.70	31.55	26.82	24.75	3.39	3.05	0.34	0.00	0.68	2.37	1.02	1.69	2.37	0.34	1.69	1.02	0.34	1.02	1.02	2.03	6.10	1.36	1.02	0.00	0.68	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.34	0.00

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Hands Off Social Security  Medicare  Medicaid: Sixteen senators told President Barack Obama on Friday not to cut Social Security  Medicare or Medicaid in his annual budget  Sen. Bernie Sanders authored the letter telling the president not to endanger the middle class and contribute to growing inequality by cutting the nation’s vital safety net  The Hill reported online. On Friday  White House press secretary Jay Carney declined to say if a cut in Social Security will be proposed again but he said the president “will continue to demonstrate his commitment to achieving additional deficit reduction.”  Don’t Cut COLAs: Sanders and 15 other senators urged Obama not to repeat a proposal from last year’s budget to lower cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security. Sen. Mary Landrieu did not sign the letter  according to The (New Orleans) Times-Picayune. Sherrod Brown  Kay Hagan and Barbara Mikluski all co-sponsored a Harkin-Sanders resolution against chained CPI last year but are not co-signers on this letter  Daily Kos noted.  Minimum Wage: An executive order raising the minimum wage for federal contract workers was “a step forward” in a national effort to lift wages for 30 million Americans making under $10.10 per hour  Sen. Sanders told The Thom Hartmann Program on Friday. “While $10.10 is not enough unto itself for a family to live with dignity  it is a step forward  so we’re going to continue the focus to raise the minimum wage to at least $10.10 an hour. There are states out there contemplating minimum wage rates higher than that  and I strongly support that ” Sanders said.  Tax Havens: The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development next month plans to release a draft international taxation plan as part of an effort to cut down on offshore tax evasion.

A Monday evening vigil outside the White House was among more than 200 demonstrations planned across the country by leading environmentalists opposed to construction of Canada’s controversial tar sands oil pipeline. President Obama will have the final say on whether to allow building the 1 200 mile pipeline to ship 830 000 barrels a day of the dirty crude oil from Alberta to refineries in Texas along the Gulf of Mexico coast.  An environmental impact study released on Friday discounted the increase in greenhouse gas emissions that would result from extracting and refining more of the dirtiest form of crude oil on the planet. Sen. Bernie Sanders said the report “turned a blind eye to the ugly reality” that expanded drilling in the tar sands region would contribute to global warming. President Obama should block construction of the pipeline  Sanders said  to avoid contributing to “the most serious environmental crisis facing the world today.” In addition to the vigil outside the White House  another was planned Monday evening in New York featuring 350.org co-founder Bill McKibben. The Vermont-based McKibben’s 350.org helped organize the vigils along with CREDO  the Sierra Club  Rainforest Action Network and other organizations.

The president has made it clear that employees working for government contractors should not be paid starvation wages. This executive order also gives us momentum for raising the minimum wage for every worker in this country to at least $10.10 an hour ” Sanders said.  The senator in September sent a letter to the president urging him to issue an executive order to setting a minimum wage for federal contractors. Sanders also is a cosponsor of Senate legislation to raise the minimum wage for all workers to $10.10 from the current $7.25 an hour.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Raise the Minimum Wage: If Congress won't raise the federal minimum wage  President Obama can  at least for people who work for companies that get federal contracts  subcontracts and grants. So says a group of liberals in the House and Senate who want Obama to sign an executive order requiring federal agencies to give preference in awarding contracts to companies that pay workers no less than $10.10 an hour. Fifteen senators  led by Bernie Sanders of Vermont  and 17 members of the House  led by Keith Ellison of Minnesota  sent letters to the president urging him to exercise his executive authority. Currently the federal minimum wage is $7.25. And there's been a push by Democrats to raise it to $10.10 -- an idea that Obama supports. The White House hasn't taken a position on whether Obama would issue an executive order  CNN Money reported.   NSA Surveillance: A federal privacy watchdog panel on Thursday pronounced the National Security Agency archiving of telephone metadata — numbers  times and lengths of calls  but not their content — an invasion of privacy that's of "limited value" in counter-terrorism cases. In a major speech outlining his agenda to reform NSA surveillance  Obama last week pressed for a plan to move the phone records out of the government’s control. But  unlike the watchdog group  he did not call for an end to the program. “The president's recommendations last week did not go far enough to rein in the out-of-control National Security Agency ” Sen. Sanders said in the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune. The report by the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board “underscores that the collection of records on virtually every phone call made in the United States is an unconstitutional violation of the privacy rights guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment ” Sanders said in The Hill.   Veterans: Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Sanders said the Senate will soon take up legislation to restore pension benefits for military retirees while expanding other programs and services for veterans  Vermont Public Radio and Brattleboro Reformer reported. Stars and Stripes and Military.com reported that Democrats "aren’t sure yet how to pay for or whether Republicans will support it."

Richard Blumenthal said  according to The (New London  Conn.) Day.   Trans-Pacific Partnership: The Trans-Pacific Partnership threatens to undo advances made by states and localities to reduce their carbon footprint  The (Williston Park  N.Y.)

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Veterans: The Senate will consider a proposal to restore $6 billion in cuts to working-age military retiree pensions  The Hill and Salem Radio Network on KUIK-AM in Portland  Ore. reported. The proposal is part of an omnibus veterans’ bill introduced Thursday by Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders. “The American people have spoken very loudly and very clearly. They have told the Congress to restore those cuts to military retirees and we have listened ” Sanders said.    Obama to Meet Pope: A decision to visit Pope Francis at the Vatican in late March provides President Obama with an opportunity to highlight the problem of economic inequality. “Clearly  the pope and the president have their differences ” but widening inequality clearly troubles both of them  Sen. Sanders said in an interview Tuesday with The Washington Post. “It is a moral issue  and once we begin to look at those issues from a moral perspective  it demands political solutions.”   Minimum Wage: President Barack Obama told his Cabinet this month he would not resign himself to "waiting for legislation" from a gridlocked Congress in order to push his agenda  The president could move the ball forward by announcing a few dramatic actions at his State of the Union address this month. Sen. Sanders and other progressive leaders have urged the president to issue an executive order that would ensure that taxpayer dollars go only to federal contractors that pay their employees a living wage  Katrina vanden Heuvel wrote for The Washington Post online.   Food Banks Prepare for Food Stamp Cuts: Even greater demands on food banks are expected as Congress prepares to cut billions of dollars more from the food stamp program. About 47 million Americans receive food stamps. A compromise farm bill is expected to cut about $9 billion from food stamps over 10 years. House Republicans had wanted to trim financing by $40 billion over the same period  and a bipartisan Senate bill sought a $4 billion cut. But House members  most of them Republicans  may be unwilling to pass a bill that includes anything less than the $40 billion cut. And senators  especially Democrats  may see the compromise measure as going too far. President Obama has threatened to veto any bill that cuts too deeply  The New York Times reported.

Citizens United: Four years ago today the Supreme Court gutted campaign finance laws and lifted limits on corporate campaign cash. On Jan. 21  2010  Sen. Bernie Sanders predicted that the ruling would “give control of the political process in the United States to the wealthiest and most powerful institutions in the world and the candidates who support their agenda. Instead of democracy being about one-person one-vote  it will now be about the size of a company’s bank account.”  The 5-to-4 decision in Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission  led to rulings that let wealthy individuals like the billionaires Charles and David Koch pour unlimited and unregulated sums into campaign coffers.

Must Read: For the Love of Money - Sam Polk  The New York Times:   IN my last year on Wall Street my bonus was $3.6 million — and I was angry because it wasn’t big enough. I was 30 years old  had no children to raise  no debts to pay  no philanthropic goal in mind. I wanted more money for exactly the same reason an alcoholic needs another drink: I was addicted.  Eight years earlier  I’d walked onto the trading floor at Credit Suisse First Boston to begin my summer internship. I already knew I wanted to be rich  but when I started out I had a different idea about what wealth meant. I’d come to Wall Street after reading in the book “Liar’s Poker” how Michael Lewis earned a $225 000 bonus after just two years of work on a trading floor. That seemed like a fortune. Every January and February  I think about that time  because these are the months when bonuses are decided and distributed  when fortunes are made.  I’d learned about the importance of being rich from my dad. He was a modern-day Willy Loman  a salesman with huge dreams that never seemed to materialize. “Imagine what life will be like ” he’d say  “when I make a million dollars.” While he dreamed of selling a screenplay  in reality he sold kitchen cabinets. And not that well. We sometimes lived paycheck to paycheck off my mom’s nurse-practitioner salary.  Dad believed money would solve all his problems. At 22  so did I. When I walked onto that trading floor for the first time and saw the glowing flat-screen TVs  high-tech computer monitors and phone turrets with enough dials  knobs and buttons to make it seem like the cockpit of a fighter plane  I knew exactly what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. It looked as if the traders were playing a video game inside a spaceship; if you won this video game  you became what I most wanted to be — rich.

Obama's Pacific Trade Pact Will Be Awful for the Environment:  The Trans-Pacific Partnership  a trade deal that the Obama administration calls a “top priority ” has earned the president relentless criticism for the secrecy of negotiations. Now  drafts of some of the agreement’s chapters  posted by WikiLeaks  are raising new concerns. After the chapter concerning environmental policy and protections went public Wednesday  the Sierra Club  Natural Resources Defense Council  and World Wildlife Fund released a disappointed analysis of its contents. "This draft chapter falls flat on every single one of our issues—oceans  fish  wildlife  and forest protections—and in fact  rolls back on the progress made in past free trade pacts ” said Michael Brune of the Sierra Club in a statement.

Sen. Sanders' Statement on Funding Bill Passage:   “This is most certainly not the budget that I would have written. At a time when one out of four corporations pays nothing in federal income taxes and income inequality is exploding  this budget fails to ask the richest Americans or most profitable corporations to pay a nickel more in taxes.   “Having said that  this bill makes some significant improvements to the status quo. It adds $1 billion to Head Start to help some 90 000 kids get the early education that they need. This bill will increase funding for home heating assistance  which is very import for senior citizens on fixed incomes and families with young children in Vermont.  “While this is not the bill that I would have written  the alternative – another government shutdown – would have been catastrophic for our country and for the economy.” - Sen.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Raise the Minimum Wage: Several senators who attended a White House meeting with President Barack Obama on Wednesday brought up the possibility that he could raise the minimum wage by executive order rather than letting the issue fall victim to congressional gridlock.

Sanders and Sherrod Brown “expressed particular delight with the president’s focus on the minimum wage ” according to Politico.

Solar Slump: Five years after the Obama administration's renewable energy initiative touched off a building boom of large-scale solar power plants across the desert Southwest  the pace of development has slowed to a crawl  with a number of companies going out of business and major projects canceled for lack of financing. Of the 365 federal solar applications since 2009  just 20 plants are on track to be built. Only three large-scale solar facilities have gone online  two in California and one in Nevada. The first auction of public land for solar developers  an event once highly anticipated by federal planners  failed to draw a single bid last fall  the Los Angeles Times reported.

Today's News from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Raise the Minimum Wage: Sen. Bernie Sanders wants Congress to increase the federal minimum wages to $10.10 per hour. The independent senator made the call while highlighting that Vermont and a number of other states raised their minimum wages effective on New Year’s Day  according to an Associated Press report in the Bennington Banner  Burlington Free Press  Brattleboro Reformer  Caledonian-Record and Valley News. Sanders said raising the federal minimum wage would give Americans $35-billion more to spend in their take-home pay and that would  in turn  create 85 000 more jobs  WPTZ-TV and New England Cable News reported.   Citizens United: Sixteen states have formally petitioned Congress to enact a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court’s Citizens United ruling which frees corporations to spend as much as they choose to influence elections. “Roughly 100 House members have sponsored or cosponsored amendment proposals  as have key senators such as Sanders and Sherrod Brown. Getting more states to formally demand action will cause more congressional buy-in for this necessary reform ” John Nichols blogged for The Nation.   A Progressive Agenda: As growing numbers of voters and even some top Republicans in Congress express unhappiness with the Tea Party after a government shutdown  progressive liberals like Sens. Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are trying to fill a space in the political debate by pushing issues such as income inequality and increasing minimum wage. Sanders posted his priorities for 2014 on Monday in a blog on Huffington Post  The Washington Times reported.   Resurgent Left: “The re-emergence of a Democratic left will be one of the major stories of 2014 … [T]he new militancy on the Democratic left is a consequence of a slowly building backlash against the skewed nature of our politics. Take the most recent flash point. Discussions about entitlements have revolved almost exclusively around the question of how much to cut them. By contrast  progressives such as Sens. Warren  Sanders  and Sherrod Brown  say we must begin dealing with a coming retirement crisis fostered by the steady disappearance of traditional private pensions ” columnist E.J. Dionne Jr.  wrote in Thursday’s Washington Post  Anchorage Daily News  Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and the Bristol (Conn.) Press.

New Year's Day:   The first day of 2014 means a pay raise in for workers in Vermont and 12 other states making the minimum wage set by state laws. Sen. Bernie Sanders thinks workers across the United States deserve a living wage and cosponsored legislation to boost the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. “States and communities are not waiting for Congress to raise the minimum wage.  They are doing the right thing because the simple truth is that working people cannot survive on the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour  or $8 an hour or $9 an hour. If people work 40 hours a week  they deserve not to live in dire poverty ” Sanders said.  Wage increases at the state and local level are occurring at a time of growing income inequality.  In the last several years  95 percent of all new income went to the top 1 percent. “We need to raise the minimum wage to at least $10.10 an hour ” said Sanders. “That’s why I cosponsored legislation which will soon be on the Senate floor.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/new-years-day  Watch Sen.

2014: Seize the Moment:   The Congress has just ended one of the worst and least productive sessions in the history of our country. At a time when the problems facing us are monumental  Congress is dysfunctional and more and more people (especially the young) are  understandably  giving up on the political process. The people are hurting. They look to Washington for help. Nothing is happening.  In my view  the main cause of congressional dysfunction is an extreme right-wing Republican party whose main goal is to protect the wealthy and powerful. There is no tax break for the rich or large corporations that they don't like. There is no program which protects working families -- Social Security  Medicare  Medicaid  food stamps  affordable housing  etc. -- that they don't want to cut.  But the Democrats (with whom I caucus as an Independent) are most certainly not without fault. In the Senate  they have tolerated Republican obstructionism for much too long and allowed major legislation to fail for lack of 60 votes. They have failed to bring forth a strong and consistent agenda which addresses the economic crises facing the vast majority of our struggling population  and have not rallied the people in support of that agenda.  As we survey our country at the end of 2013  I don't have to tell you about the crises we face. Many of you are experiencing them every day.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Raise the Minimum Wage: The federal minimum wage should be raised from $7.25 an hour to $10.10 an hour  Sen. Bernie Sanders told MSNBC's Thomas Roberts on Monday that. “Most people understand that is a starvation wage. Individuals can't live on it  families can't live on it ” Sanders said. He is a cosponsor of a bill that would raise the wage.   Unemployment: If Congress fails to extend long-term unemployment benefits that expired on Saturday for 1.3 million Americans  another 5 million people looking for work will lose benefits this year. “You are cutting off your nose to spite your face by denying people who need the help the help they should be getting ” Sen. Sanders said on WCAX-TV on Monday. He explained why on The Ed Schultz Show. “What the economists tell us is that if we shut off extended unemployment benefits  we are going to lose about 200 000 jobs  because these folks will not be spending money and the GDP for next year will go down by about two-tenths of 1 percent.”  NSA Spying: Vermont lawmakers support legislation to rein in massive National Security Agency surveillance programs  Vermont Public Radio reported. “If they have probable cause that somebody is involved in terrorism  go after them and do all the investigating you have to do tap all the phones you have to tap ” said Sen. Sanders. “But that is a very different proposition than saying we are going to be collecting data on virtually every single American 99.9 percent of whom have nothing to do with terrorism.”   Seize the Moment: “If we are going to save the middle class and protect our planet  we need to change the political dynamics of the nation.

Minimum Wage: With polls showing widespread support for an increase in the $7.25-per-hour federal minimum wage among both Republican and Democratic voters  top Democrats see a tool with which to enlarge the electorate in a nonpresidential election  when turnout among minorities and youths typically drops off. The effort to take advantage of growing populism among voters in both parties is being coordinated by officials from the White House  labor unions and liberal advocacy groups  according to The New York Times.   NSA Spying: A German magazine lifted the lid on the operations of the National Security Agency’s hacking unit Sunday  reporting that American spies intercept computer deliveries  exploit hardware vulnerabilities  and even hijack Microsoft’s internal reporting system to spy on their targets.

NSA Spying: Sen. Sanders wrote that "the NSA today is out of control and we need strong legislation to rein them in. In a free society  the government does not collect data on tens of millions of people  99.999 percent of whom have nothing to do with terrorism. We must be vigilant in protecting the American people from terrorism  but we can do that without taking away the constitutional and privacy rights which make us a free nation " Max Obuszewski noted in a letter to the editor of The Baltimore Sun.   Populists: “What we're seeing more broadly though is a rise in populism in both the Republican and the Democratic parties and there's a divide within each party.

Sanders told The Wall Street Journal as he left a briefing on the budget deal.

Federal Worker Pensions: New civilian employees hired after Jan. 1 would have to pay more toward their federal pensions under the budget deal that also would trim benefits for some military retirees.

I have to decide which is worse ” said Sanders  a member of the budget conference.   Health Care: Sen. Sanders says the difficult rollout of the Affordable Care Act and the complexity of the new law highlight the need to adopt a streamlined single-payer health system. “What we need to do is move toward a simple system  a non-bureaucratic system which says health care is a right ” Sanders told Vermont Public Radio. The American Health Security Act that Sanders introduced on Monday would require states to create their own single-payer insurance systems  WCAX-TV and The Thom Hartmann Program reported.

Today’s news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Sanders Introduces Single-Payer Bill in Senate: Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday introduced the American Health Security Act  which would require each state to set up a single-payer health care system and undo the private insurance exchanges that have plagued Obamacare. Meanwhile  state-led efforts in Vermont  Massachusetts and elsewhere could sweep the country statehouse by statehouse as soon as lawmakers see the advantage of a single-payer system.  “As the president fully understands  the rollout has been a disaster  the website has been a disaster ” said Sanders. “But the truth is  even if all of those problems were corrected tomorrow and if the Affordable Care Act did all that it was supposed to do  it would be only a modest step forward to dealing with the dysfunction of the American health care system ” Sanders told The Daily Beast.   Unemployment Insurance in Jeopardy: Unemployment insurance benefits for 1.3 million long-term unemployed Americans will expire at the end of the month if Congress fails to pass an extension. “We have got to create millions of jobs and we have got to pass legislation to protect the long-term unemployed ” Sen. Sanders said Monday on MSNBC.  Raise the Minimum Wage: Calling for passage of a bill he cosponsored to raise the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10  Sen. Sanders disputed opponents’ claims that employers would slash payrolls. “They’re just factually wrong. In my state of Vermont  our minimum wage is $8.60 compared to the national minimum wage of $7.25. We have one of the lowest unemployment rates in America. You have states where there is virtually no minimum wage at all  and their unemployment rate is much higher. The facts just don’t bear it out. The reality is that if we raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour about 30 million Americans would get a pay raise  and 88 percent of them are adults. These are not kids. These are working families struggling to keep their heads above water. They need a pay raise. We’ve gotta pass it ” Sanders said on MSNBC.

Long-Term Unemployment:  More than 1.3 million Americans without jobs for six months or more face an unemployment insurance cutoff at the end of December. As the impact continues to be felt from worst recession since the 1930s  Sen. Bernie Sanders joined 31 other senators who signed a letter urging Congress to preserve federal unemployment insurance for another year.  While the official 7 percent unemployment rate in November was the lowest in five years  long-term unemployment remained near record highs. Altogether some 4 million Americans  more than one-third of all those who are unemployed  have been jobless for six months or more.   The immediate threat affects about 1.3 million workers who would lose benefits if Congress lets an emergency program expire in the days after Christmas. Another 1.9 million would have their benefits cut later in the year. (Some 600 Vermonters face an immediate cutoff after Dec. 28  and 2 300 more Vermonters could lose benefits later in 2014  according to the National Employment Law Project.) A new study by the same group showed that federal unemployment insurance keeps workers in the job hunt and families out of poverty.

Break Up Big Banks:   The number of U.S. banks has fallen to 6 891  the least since 1934 when the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. – created in the wake of the Great Depression – began keeping track. The decline is from a peak of more than 18 000  according to a Wall Street Journal article published on Tuesday. The acceleration of the unwelcome trend was predicted as long ago as 1999 by then Rep. Bernie Sanders. The House that summer was considering a bill to allow commercial banks  investment banks and insurance companies to merge by repealing the Glass-Steagall Act. Sanders predicted that such a massive deregulation of the financial services industry would lead to fewer banks and financial service providers; increased charges and fees for individual consumers and small businesses; diminished credit for rural America and taxpayer exposure to potential losses should a financial conglomerate fail. “It will lead to more mega-mergers; a small number of corporations dominating the financial service industry; and further concentration of economic power in our country ” Sanders said.  Nevertheless  the bill passed.

Despite all the problems  state and federal officials who support the law say that the long-term benefits of having access to better insurance will make up for the immediate frustrations with the website. “If some of the folks who are on these inadequate policies go to the exchange   they may find that for the same amount of money  or perhaps a little bit more  they're going to find that they get a lot better coverage " Sen. Bernie Sanders said  in an interview  with the Valley News.

Poverty in America:   The nation's poverty rate was 16.0 percent in 2012  according to U.S. Census Bureau data released on Wednesday. The supplemental poverty measure takes into account the impact on family resources of different benefits and expenses. Social Security  for example  kept 26.6 million Americans out of poverty last year. Food stamps provided by the Supplemental Assistance Nutrition Program  or SNAP  kept another 5 million people above the poverty level  the report said. The main reason people fell into poverty last year was out-of-pocket health care expenses. That put 10.6 million people into poverty  the Census Bureau said.  Instead of working to cut poverty  some in Congress are considering cuts to the very programs that have kept people out of poverty.  Sen.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  NSA is ‘Out of Control’: President Obama is poised to order the National Security Agency to stop eavesdropping on the leaders of American allies  administration and congressional officials said on Monday. Sen. Bernie Sanders called the spy agency “out of control” during a Monday interview with National Public Radio’s John Hockenberry. “How are we going to have the kind of cooperation that we need when there is massive mistrust of the United States for this type of spying?” Sanders asked in response to reports that the agency targeted the cellphone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and eavesdropped on other world leaders.  Dark Money: Sen. Ted Cruz is blocking Senate consideration of President Obama's choice to head the Federal Communications Commission until the nominee promises that the broadcast industry regulator won’t require more funding disclosures for political TV ads. "Ultimately  what they are about is creating a campaign finance system where billionaires can spend unlimited sums of money on campaigns and candidates  electing the people they want. That is not  in my view  a democracy. That is called oligarchy " Sen. Sanders told MSNBC's Ed Schultz on Monday. Raw Story and Politicususa blogged about the interview.  Older Americans: The Older Americans Act is one of the most important pieces of legislation that you probably never heard of or at least know very little about.  You know Meals on Wheels?  The OAA funds it  and also essential services for seniors like job training  caregiver support  transportation  preventive health services  and protection from abuse and financial exploitation. This Wednesday  Sen. Sanders will offer a 5-year reauthorization of the legislation to the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee. If the legislation is to pass the Senate and the House  it will need strong bipartisan support from the Committee  Greg Kaufmann blogged for The Nation.  Don’t Cut Social Security: President Obama proposed to cut Social Security in his 2014 budget  but “Senate Democratic leaders appointed Sanders to the conference committee  perhaps signaling their desire to hold the line against entitlement changes ” Congressional Quarterly said. The Huffington Post said Sanders has spoken out against Obama's offer to cut Social Security benefits as part of a compromise.

A single-payer system  like Medicare  is the cure for America's ailing healthcare - Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)  The Guardian:   I start my approach to healthcare from two very basic premises. First  healthcare must be recognized as a right  not a privilege. Every man  woman and child in our country should be able to access the healthcare they need regardless of their income. Second  we must create a national healthcare system that provides quality healthcare for all in the most cost-effective way possible.  Tragically  the United States is failing in both areas.  It is unconscionable that in one of the most advanced nations in the world  there are nearly 50 million people who lack health insurance and millions more who have burdensome co-payments and deductibles. In fact  some 45 000 Americans die each year because they do not get to a doctor when they should. In terms of life expectancy  infant mortality and other health outcomes  the United States lags behind almost every other advanced country.  Despite this unimpressive record  the US spends almost twice as much per person on healthcare as any other nation. As a result of an incredibly wasteful  bureaucratic  profit-making and complicated system  the US spends 17% of its gross domestic product – approximately $2.7tn annually– on healthcare. While insurance companies  drug companies  private hospitals and medical equipment suppliers make huge profits  Americans spend more and get less for their healthcare dollars.  What should the US be doing to improve this abysmal situation?

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Sanders at Center of Budget Battles: Sen. Bernie Sanders is optimistic that the lawmakers named to a committee responsible for crafting a fiscal 2014 budget agreement stand some chance of success. The Vermont independent  one of the negotiators on that conference committee  believes Americans’ low opinion of Congress — particularly of Republicans — will motivate the panel to address unemployment and mounting deficits in a way that’s fair to working families. “There is that pressure on everybody’s shoulders  regardless of your politics  and I hope that moves us in a fruitful direction ” he told the Burlington Free Press.  Sanders: Obama ‘Dead Wrong’ on Social Security: President Obama has offered to compromise with Republicans on changes to Social Security in hopes of corralling Republican support for his budget. "The president is dead wrong on this issue " Sen. Bernie Sanders told The Boston Globe. Sanders has been promoting a bill to raise Social Security withholding taxes significantly on those earning more than $250 000 a year  who currently do not pay Social Security taxes on the majority of their earnings. Sanders and his staff are fond of pointing out where they got the idea: Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.  The Right Way to Make a Budget: “It is time to develop a federal budget that is moral and makes good economic sense ” Sen. Sanders wrote in an op-ed published Monday by the Los Angeles Times. “It is time to develop a budget that invests in our future by creating jobs  rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure and expanding educational opportunities. It is time for those who have so much to help with deficit reduction. It is time that we listen to what the American people want.”  Sanders in the South: Sen. Sanders on his first Southern speaking tour posed a question that may seem simple but continually vexes and frustrates politicians  pundits  political scientists and columnists: "Why do white working-class people vote against their own interests?" he asked about 150 people at the annual meeting of the Progressive Network ” according to a Sunday column in The (Florence  S.C.) Morning News.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Vermont Eyes Bigger Goal on Health Care: Vermont plans to launch the nation's first universal health care system  a sort of modified Medicare-for-all. It's an open question whether Vermont can work as a model for other states. "Developing a single-payer system for Vermont is a lot easier than in California or Texas or New York " said Sen. Bernie Sanders  using a term to describe a system in which health care is paid for by a single entity. He has been pushing for some form of socialized medicine since he was mayor of Burlington 30 years ago  according to The Associated Press.  Spying on Allies: In Washington on Saturday  demonstrators held up signs reading "Thank you  Edward Snowden!" as they rallied near the U.S. Capitol to demand that Congress investigate the National Security Agency’s mass surveillance of Americans and eavesdropping on allied heads of state. “It sends a terrible message throughout the world. We’re saying we don’t really trust you ” Sen. Sanders told WCAX-TV in an interview on Friday.  He also called for legislation to limit the NSA’s wholesale collection of data on Americans who are not suspected of any wrongdoing. He called the NSA “out of control” and urged the spy agency to “stop this nonsense.”  Budget Conference: Sen. Sanders is on the special budget conference committee that begins work this week on what could be a one-year plan to keep the government running when funding runs out in December. “I really don’t expect another government shutdown. I think Republicans have learned their lesson ” Sanders said on WCAX-TV.  Bernie for President?: “We need voices in the national campaign to speak about the needs of working people ” Sanders told WCAX-TV in the Friday night interview  but he quickly added that “there are other fine people out there” and said that “it’s very unlikely” he will mount a campaign for the White House. On Vermont Public Television  Vermont This Week host Stewart Ledbetter mentioned that there is talk  “as far-fetched as it may sound ” of Sanders running for president. Running as a Democrat  Ledbetter added  “seems anathema to the senator from Vermont.” Radio host Mark Johnson also was dubious but said Sanders  when pressed  “hasn’t closed the door on it.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/102713	HER	status	93.53	70.17	30.17	54.22	18.05	24.69	2.27	0.76	0.00	0.00	0.00	1.51	1.01	1.01	2.77	0.25	3.02	0.50	2.27	0.50	1.26	2.02	3.27	0.76	0.76	0.00	0.50	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.25	0.25

I think we've got an agency that's a bit out of control ” Sen. Bernie Sanders said on WCAX-TV.

Spying on Friends:   Sen. Bernie Sanders on Thursday decried “outrageous” eavesdropping by the National Security Agency on some of the United States’ closest allies.   Sanders is cosponsoring legislation that would significantly rein in the sweeping surveillance activities of the NSA and other intelligence agencies.   In a letter to President Barack Obama  the senator also voiced concern that the U.S. actions could undermine cooperation in the fight against terrorism.  “The strained relations with our allies as a result of wholesale NSA eavesdropping have impacted our ability to work with these countries in combating terrorism and advancing common economic goals ” Sanders said. “Clearly  in the complex and difficult world we now find ourselves  it is imperative that we try to improve our relations with friendly countries  not exacerbate them.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/spying-on-friends	HER	link	95.19	85.46	32.70	4.42	20.29	38.03	2.11	4.23	2.11	1.41	0.00	2.82	0.70	1.41	1.41	0.70	2.11	0.00	1.41	0.00	9.86	4.23	3.52	1.41	2.11	0.00	0.70	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00

Ahead of the negotiations  Republicans have said they believe there is room to negotiate because Democrats want to undo or replace some or all of sequestration and the Republicans want curbs on entitlement programs. Sens. Bernard Sanders and Tom Harkin have argued in the past against the idea of cutting entitlements  Congressional Quarterly reported.

Notably absent from that list is Richard Burr  the top Republican on Sanders’ subcommittee on aging  Congressional Quarterly reported.  Jobs: The government’s report on September employment came out Tuesday  delayed by the shutdown. “The furious debate over the budget did not concern our ongoing unemployment tragedy.

Corporations are sitting on record cash and profits  but they are not hiring at the rates of previous post-World War II recessions. The meme on the left…does it matter? America has little of a true elected left aside from Bernie Sanders ” Jon Talton blogged for The Seattle Times.

Incomprehensible. And because of their power over the political process  you hear a deafening silence in the U.S. Congress and in other bodies around the world about the severity of the problem. Global warming is a far more serious problem than al Qaeda.”  What do you think?

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Don't Cut Social Security: With eyes now turning toward a new budget committee  some liberals are worried about President Obama's proposal to cut Social Security.

Sanders Calls Out Deficit Hypocrites: Sen. Sanders on Saturday offered a glimpse of how he might tackle the budget. "The hypocrisy is extraordinary. When it comes to Medicaid  we just can't afford to provide health insurance to our children [but] when it comes to going to a war that we never should have gotten into [in Iraq]  no problem. These same deficit hypocrites … gave huge tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires " Sanders said at Penn Center on St. Helena Island  S.C.  one of the earliest schools for freed slaves  and a favorite getaway for Martin Luther King during the Civil Rights movement  Corey Hutchins blogged.  Obama Calls in Computer Experts: The Obama administration said Sunday that it has enlisted additional computer experts from across the government and from private companies to help rewrite computer code and make other improvements to the online health insurance marketplace  which has been plagued by technical defects that have stymied many consumers since it opened nearly three weeks ago.

Bernie Sanders was named to a committee to try and create a long-term budget plan by Dec. 13 and prevent another government shutdown. “It’s important to have Sen.

Sanders in the South: Sen. Sanders' visit Saturday to St. Helena's Island resulted in something rare in the conservative Lowcountry: a self-described socialist receiving a standing ovation.

The longest-serving independent in Congress visited South Carolina after stops in Alabama  Georgia and Mississippi in an effort to unite progressives and working- and middle-class conservatives  The Beufort Gazette  The Associated Press and Raw Story reported.   Obama Wins Standoff with Congress: President Obama trounced the Republicans last week with a strategy of holding firm and winning an argument  not by finding common ground. Obama has proved better at the messy business of helping hold together his own party's congressional caucus than President Bill Clinton did. “For all the talk of Obama's distaste for schmoozing  he was the one who finally passed a health care law by holding together every single Senate Democrat  from Bernie Sanders on the left to Ben Nelson on the right ” according to The New York Times.

From the end of World War II until 1973  we saw an expanding middle class  with people’s incomes going up. Since that point  and especially since the Wall Street–driven financial crisis  you’ve seen a real collapse. Since 1999 median family income has gone down $5 000. Real unemployment  counting people who have given up looking for work or who are working part-time when they want to work full-time  is more than 14 percent.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Shutdown Ends :The federal government reopened Thursday after Congress ended a 16-day partial shutdown and averted a default on U.S. obligations. President Barack Obama signed the measure that made virtually no concessions on the health care law that was the reason Republicans started the fiscal crisis. Sen. Bernie Sanders called the resolution “a major political victory” but cautioned in a late-night interview on MSNBC that continued spending cuts contained in the stopgap bill are “a disaster.”  He said he was glad that for now the "nightmare" was over  The Associated Press  Burlington Free Press  Times Argus  Rutland Herald  Seven Days and The Washington Times reported.   Sanders Named to Budget Conference: Sen. Sanders was appointed to a conference committee to try to reconcile separate budget documents passed by the House and Senate this year. “I look forward to the negotiations that will take place ” Sanders said on MSNBC. “The time is long overdue that we stood up for the working families of this country  for the children and for the elderly and not move toward deficit reduction on the backs of the most vulnerable people " Sanders said in a floor speech on WCAX-TV.   The Agenda Ahead: The shutdown and the crisis atmosphere it created kept Congress from doing the work it should have been doing all along. “There are enormous issues facing this country. The middle class is disappearing. Poverty is at an all-time high. We're not even beginning to address the international crisis of global warming or our crumbling infrastructure or extremely high unemployment ” Sanders told Thomas Roberts in an interview earlier Wednesday on MSNBC.   The Next Fight: With the government re-opening and default averted  larger budget battles over entitlements and sequestration lie ahead. “When you have the Koch brothers  who sit on $71 billion  pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the political process  trust me this battle has not ended ” Sen. Sanders told MSNBC’s Rev. Al Sharpton. “Our job is to bring the working people  the middle class of this country  together to stand up to the big money interests who want to repeal every major piece of legislation passed in the last 80 years to protect ordinary Americans.”  Tea Party Damaged America: Sen. Sanders said in a Senate floor speech Wednesday that Tea Party Republicans had severely damaged the country  The Hill reported online. The country has suffered a black eye in the world community  Sanders told the Vermont Press Bureau. “How can you proclaim to be the leading power in the world  the country that others are supposed to look up to  when you can’t even keep your government open and you can’t pay your bills?” Sanders asked.  “The United States’ position in the world has been severely damaged by this ” he added. On The Thom Hartmann Program  Sanders said House Speaker John Boehner could have prevented the crisis.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   House in Disarray  Senate Scrambles  Default Looms  Government Stays Shuttered  Sanders Says it’s ‘Frightening’: With the federal government on the brink of default  Senate leaders resumed talks on a deal to reopen the government and extend the Treasury Department’s debt limit. Senate leaders were blindsided Tuesday by news that House Republicans were moving forward on competing legislation  but that effort fizzled when Speaker John Boehner failed to pick up enough votes from right-wing Republicans. “The Republican House these guys cannot agree on anything so it is a bit of a frightening situation ” Sen. Bernie Sanders told Vermont Public Radio. Sanders doesn’t like it that the Senate compromise that was in the works would solve the problem for only a few months  but he told VPR  “I am willing to back off of that and say  'Alright  we have to avert the crisis right now in front of us.’”   Sanders Sees a Way Out: “Let’s take a deep breath ” Sen. Sanders told CNN on Tuesday. "What I hope and expect happens is in the 12th hour  Boehner looks his right-wing extremists in the eye and says 'Look guys  I have gone as far as I can with you. I cannot allow a default to take place. I cannot allow this entire world's economy to go into recession. We're going to work with the Democrats. We're going to pass what the Senate has brought us.’ And that's the way out.”  Budget Conference: Whenever the dust settles on the debt and government shutdown crises  the House and Senate appear likely to embark on a new round of budget talks under the auspices of a now-rare bicameral conference committee. Sen. Sanders is on the Budget Committee and could be among the negotiators pushing for new tax money. “One out of four corporations in this country does not pay any federal income taxes ” Sanders told Roll Call. “Clearly  that’s an absurdity that has to be addressed and be part of that negotiation.”  Border Crossing Delays: Sen. Sanders hosted an August meeting with Vermont state officials and business interests to urge Customs and Border Protection management to address staff shortages that have resulted in long lines and frustrating delays entering the United States. “It’s from both an economic point of view and a security point of view not a good situation ” Sanders told the Burlington Free Press.

An Attack on Seniors and Veterans:   With senior poverty in the United States significantly increasing  Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday expressed deep concern that Social Security recipients  disabled veterans and federal retirees may receive only a 1.5 percent cost-of-living adjustment next year. The estimate that the typical retiree is in line for only a $17 a month raise  one of the smallest increases ever  was made by The Associated Press. The projection comes at a time when congressional Republicans  led by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan  have used the government shutdown as leverage to renew their push to cut benefits even more. The Republicans and some Democrats want to change how inflation is calculated by adopting a so-called chained consumer price index. The chained CPI also would lower benefits for disabled veterans and federal retirees.

Day 13:   With a partial government shutdown stretching into its 13th day and the looming potential for a historic default on government debts just days away  Senate leaders talked on Sunday but did not settle an impasse over a stopgap measure to reopen the government. The stalemate began Oct. 1 over House Republican demands to gut the Affordable Care Act. When that didn’t work  the House shifted course last week and tried to use the shutdown as an excuse to cut Social Security. (The Associated Press reported on Sunday that next year’s cost-of-living adjustment  even with no change in the law  will probably be only  1.5 percent  one of the lowest ever. It’s not certain because the workers who crunch the inflation numbers have been furloughed.) The budget negotiations on Sunday reportedly focused on  how long the government should be funded and for how long.  The Senate also took steps to reconsider a vote on Saturday when Republicans  voting in lockstep  blocked consideration of a resolution to let the government continue to pay its bills.  Sen. Bernie Sanders worried that a default would spike interest rates on home mortgages  car loans  student loans and credit cards  but he said on Saturday that he believes  Wall Street and big-money interests would not let “the crazies” force the country into a default that could send the economy into a tailspin.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Senate Republicans Block Debt Ceiling Extension: Senate Republicans on Saturday stopped a Democratic effort to avoid default by raising the government’s borrowing limit through next year. “The issue is pretty clear ” Sen. Bernie Sanders said afterward. “It is not a major ask to allow the United States government to continue functioning. It is not a major ask that the United States government pays its bills ” Sanders added on MSNBC.  Deadbeat Nation: “It's becoming increasingly possible that for the first time in the history of our country the United States will become a deadbeat nation  precipitating a national and international financial crisis ” Sen. Sanders said Saturday on WVNY-TV. "If a default occurs  it is likely that interest rates will spike for home mortgages  car loans  student loans and credit cards ” Sen. Sanders said on WPTZ-TV. “This must not be allowed to happen.”VIDEO  VIDEO   The House Crazies: Sen. Sanders said the government could reopen and the debt ceiling crisis could be averted if Wall Street puts pressure on House Speaker John Boehner. “The Republican Party remains very dependent on Wall Street and big money interests and I think those guys are going to go to John Boehner and say  ‘John  listen  you've got to deal with these crazies. You have to have a vote in which all members of the House can vote.’ And if he does that at the request of the big money guys  I think we're going to keep the government open and I think we're going to pay our debts ” Sanders said on MSNBC.

Dangerous Territory:   Senate Republicans on a party-line vote on Saturday blocked consideration of a measure to raise the federal debt ceiling. “I find it incredible that every Republican voted against a motion to even let the Senate consider legislation to pay our bills and prevent a default ” Sen. Bernie Sanders said afterward. “We are entering very dangerous territory.”  “It is becoming increasingly possible that for the first time in the history of our country the United States will become a deadbeat nation  precipitating a national and international financial crisis. If a default occurs  it is likely that interest rates will spike for home mortgages  car loans  student loans and credit cards. It is possible that the stock market will plunge  deeply impacting pension programs and household savings. This must not be allowed to happen.”  “The American people have been very clear in understanding that right-wing Tea Party Republicans should not be shutting down the government or threating not to pay our bills because of their hatred of the Affordable Care Act or wanting cuts in Social Security  Medicare or Medicaid. That is wrong. A democratic government cannot function when a small faction choses to hold the American people hostage.”   Weigh in by taking the poll here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/polls/debt-ceiling	HER	link	85.01	51.84	33.44	33.73	18.08	28.57	2.76	2.30	0.46	0.92	0.00	2.76	0.92	1.84	3.23	1.38	4.15	0.46	0.46	0.00	3.69	0.46	5.99	0.46	3.23	0.00	0.46	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Watch Out  1%: Republicans are pitching massive spending reductions  including cuts to Social Security  in ongoing negotiations over the government shutdown and debt ceiling. Sen. Bernie Sanders said reforms are needed to extend Social Security's long-term solvency. “The answer is  to my mind  you end the absurdity that somebody who is making $100 million a year pays into the system the same as someone making $113 000 " Sanders told Mary Kissel in a Wall Street Journal video interview. “So if you’re in the top 1 percent  watch out ” she concluded.   Still No Deal: President Barack Obama on Friday began working aggressively with House and Senate Republicans to shape a deal to raise the debt ceiling and fully reopen the federal government  signaling a quickening pace in discussions to end a political stalemate that risks a U.S. debt crisis. The White House rejected a core part of a proposal from House Republican leaders that would extend the nation's borrowing authority for six weeks if the president committed to deficit-reduction negotiations. Instead  Mr. Obama signaled that he wants a deal that raises the debt ceiling for a longer period and creates a longer-term forum for budget talks  The Wall Street Journal reported.  Reid Pans Six-Week Deal: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has rejected the House Republican proposal for a six-week increase in the debt limit  The Hill reported. "We do not believe a six-week delay of a catastrophic default is enough time to give the economy the confidence it needs " Reid said on Friday.  2 States Plan 2-Tier System for Balloting: Barred by the Supreme Court from requiring proof of citizenship for federal elections  Arizona is complying — but setting up a separate registration system for local and state elections that will demand such proof. The state this week joined Kansas in planning for such a two-tiered voting system  which could keep thousands of people from participating in state and local elections  including next year’s critical cycle  when top posts in both states will be on the ballot The New York Times reported.

The Week in Review:   The government shutdown dragged into a second week. A growing majority of Democrats and about 20 Republicans in the House favor a Senate-passed resolution to reopen the government  but Speaker John Boehner refused to bring the resolution up for a vote. When House Republicans first forced a shutdown on Oct. 1  they were demanding the defunding of Obamacare as part of any deal. That would be a death sentence for thousands of Americans without health insurance  Sen. Bernie Sanders told a Senate hearing on Thursday. As the week wore on  Republicans shifted their rationale for closing the government and defaulting on the country’s debts.  Now they demand deep cuts in Social Security and other programs. The whole spectacle drove public approval of Congress  especially Republicans and the Tea Party  to new lows. As Sanders sized up the situation in a Friday floor speech  he began by citing a piece in The Onion. “Psychiatrists Deeply Concerned for 5% of Americans Who Approve of Congress ” the headline said.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Furloughed Workers Protest Shutdown: Hundreds of furloughed federal workers rallied in the rain on Thursday alongside the Congressional Progressive Caucus to ask House Republican leaders to allow a vote on a clean government funding bill that would end the government shutdown  Politico reported. Sen. Sanders said the current budget fight was not limited to disagreements over the Affordable Care Act  but a "huge ideological struggle for the future of America." Republicans  Sanders said  are using the shutdown to blackmail Democrats into agreeing to deep cuts to Social Security  Medicare and environmental programs.   Boehner's Offer 'Totally Unsatisfactory': House Speaker John Boehner Thursday evening offered a six-week extension of the debt ceiling in exchange for budget cut negotiations with President Barack Obama. “Totally unsatisfactory ” Sen. Sanders said of the offer which would leave the government closed. Democrats should insist on ending the government shutdown and on passage of a long-term extension of the debt limit  Sanders added in an MSNBC interview cited by Politico.  Reopen America: Instead of offering short-term deals in exchange for prospective cuts to Social Security and other entitlement programs  Sen. Sanders told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that Republicans "should do what the American people overwhelmingly want them to do and that is reopen the government and pay our bills."  Holding the Nation Hostage: Vermont's congressional delegation remains firmly opposed to Republican efforts in Congress to hold the nation hostage with irrational demands  the Burlington Free Press reported. In an interview with Vermont Public Radio  the congressional delegation urged House Speaker Boehner to allow a vote on a clean funding bill to reopen the government. “This is enormously anti-democratic  and essentially what these guys are trying to do is annul the election in which they lost ” Sen. Sanders said.

Remember Rep. Paul Ryan? The failed Republican candidate for vice president has been relatively quiet as Tea Party extremists have commandeered his party and the debate over the government shutdown. But the House Budget Committee chairman waded into the debt-limit debate in a column published Wednesday in The Wall Street Journal. He said he would consider letting the government avoid default if “entitlement reform” is a part of the deal.  Translation: he wants to cut Social Security benefits and change Medicare.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Debt Ceiling Filibuster: Senate Republicans began to warn Tuesday that they would filibuster Democrats' plan to raise the U.S. debt limit later this week. The response  some senators said  should be to gut the filibuster. “If the Republicans are going to continue to obstruct and make it impossible to address the needs of the American people then I think we have to think about changing the rules ” Vermont's Bernie Sanders  an independent senator who caucuses with Democrats  told Politico.   Supreme Court: The Supreme Court's conservative justices appeared ready Tuesday to free big individual donors to give more money to political candidates.  Sen. Sanders  who supports limits for campaign contributions  attended the argument in the court's latest major campaign finance case  according to The Associated Press and Congressional Quarterly. “If we do not want to move this nation to a form of society where a handful of billionaires can determine the outcome of these elections  then it is imperative not only we overturn Citizens United  but we put a lid on how much people can contribute in elections ” Sanders said in a speech outside the court that aired on C-SPAN and excerpted on Democracy Now. Interviewed on KPFK-FM in Los Angeles  Sanders worried that the court will further empower a few billionaires like those behind the Tea Party shutdown who are radically altering the American political landscape.   House Fixes Symptoms  Ignores Cause: House Republicans are preparing limited legislative fixes for symptoms of the government shutdown  including a bill to fund death benefits for the families of fallen warriors. As Republicans rush to fund necessary areas piecemeal  Sen. Sanders called on the House to treat the root cause of the problems. "Every time there is a story on television or in the newspapers about the horrors of the government shutdown  our friends in the House are passing legislation to try to address it. But the reality is we have 2 million people who are not being paid. Hundreds of thousands who are not at work. Tens of millions of people who do not make the headlines " Sanders said Tuesday on MSNBC.   Shinseki Warns Shutdown is Harming Veterans: Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric K. Shinseki is warning that the government shutdown has harmed efforts to reduce the disability claims backlog and threatens to halt compensation payments for millions of veterans. “The momentum achieved over the past six months has now stalled with the government shutdown ” Shinseki said in prepared testimony he is scheduled to deliver Wednesday before the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee. A copy of his testimony was obtained by The Washington Post. Shinseki will testify that if the shutdown continues into late October  compensation payments to more than 3.8 million veterans will not be made in November. “These include thousands of veterans who have the most severe disabilities ” he said in his advance testimony. Pension payments will also stop for almost 315 000 low-income veterans  Shinseki said.

Today’s news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Koch Brothers Finance Tea Party Agenda: The Koch brothers and other billionaires are financing expensive campaigns to promote the Tea Party agenda starting with defunding President Barack Obama's health care law  Sen. Bernie Sanders told MSNBC's Thomas Roberts on Monday. "Obamacare is just the tip of the iceberg " Sanders added. He said the extreme right wing also wants massive cuts to Social Security  Medicare and Medicaid.   A Planned Shutdown: Sen. Sanders criticized House Republicans Monday for causing a government shutdown that was “planned by the Koch brothers and other very wealthy people from the day after Obama was re-elected ” WPTZ-TV reported. “Can you imagine  Mr. President  billionaires  billionaires going to war against working people so that they and their kids cannot get health insurance? I mean I thing that is just obscene ” Sanders said in a Senate floor speech on WFFF-TV and WVNY-TV.   How the Shutdown Could End: Sen. Sanders said the government will reopen when the Republicans understand that they may lose the House of Representatives because the overwhelming majority of Americans  while disagreeing on Obamacare  nevertheless believe that it should not have been used to precipitate a government shutdown or to create a crisis over whether the United States defaults on its debts. “At the end of the day when they see that it will be politically dangerous for them to continue along this path they will change their tune ” Sanders told America Tonight anchor Joey Chen on Al Jazeera America.   Americans are Angry: “They are hurting. The average person in this country lives paycheck to paycheck and they look here at Capitol Hill and they see that instead of creating jobs we’re sending people home without pay ” Sanders said. “The way you deal with it is to say  ‘Excuse me. We’re going to remove you from office. You’re going to be defeated politically  and we’re going to have some sensible people in to replace you.’ That would be my hope and that’s my expectation ” Sanders added in the Al Jazeera America interview.

Day Seven:  As the government shutdown headed into a second week with no resolution in sight  Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday made three key points.  First  Democrats already made significant concessions in the budget talks by agreeing to lower spending levels. The Senate went along with a House budget that would continue across-the-board cuts known as sequestration. That was a “major concession ” Sanders said  but House Republicans keep adding new demands.  Second  the senator doubted House Speaker John Boehner’s claim that the Senate-passed spending resolution wouldn’t pass the House. In fact  some 20 House Republicans have signaled that they would support a so-called clean resolution and vote with House Democrats to reopen the government “Bring it to a vote  let's find out what's happening ” Sanders told Thomas Roberts on MSNBC.  Third  the shutdown strategy was planned and paid for by the Koch brothers and other wealthy individuals who want to defund the Affordable Care Act  cut Social Security benefits  end Medicare as we know it  abolish the minimum wage and cut other programs that help working families. Their attitude  Sanders said  is “to use every ounce of leverage  even if it means catastrophic pain for America and the world  so long as we get our way.” He cited a Sunday New York Times expose that detailed how the Koch brothers and others plotted the shutdown “from the day after Obama was re-elected.”  The Koch Brothers: http://youtu.be/fNj8bpY2PEY	HER	video	92.01	75.62	18.00	32.79	22.27	24.08	2.45	2.04	0.41	0.00	0.41	2.86	1.63	2.04	1.22	0.82	2.04	0.41	1.22	0.41	4.08	1.63	3.67	1.22	0.82	0.00	0.41	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00

A Political Crisis:   Charles and David Koch  the billionaire brothers with the second biggest fortune in America  are threating to bankroll primary campaigns by Tea Party extremists challenging Republicans in Congress who don’t go along with their crusade to undo the Affordable Care Act  Sen. Bernie Sanders said on Saturday during a 90-minute presentation at The New Yorker Festival.  Then on Sunday The New York Times published a report detailing how the Kochs and others bankrolled a coalition of conservative activists pushing to repeal  the health care law and threatening Republicans who won’t go along with closing the government to try to get their way.  It’s “a political crisis ” Sanders said of the shutdown. It is part of a Koch-funded campaign to annul the law that passed Congress four years ago and was upheld by the Supreme Court and was a key issue in the 2012 presidential campaign that President Obama won by 5 million votes. And it is about more than trying to unwind what the American people decided through the democratic process  Sanders stressed.Their agenda is to end Social Security and Medicare  abolish the minimum wage  destroy the EPA and undo every other program enacted in the past half century to protect working families in America  Sanders added.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Furloughed Pentagon Civilians Ordered Back: The Pentagon announced Saturday that it would order almost all of its 350 000 furloughed civilian employees back to work this week  a surprise move that could substantially reduce the impact of the government shutdown. The move takes a big bite out of the impact of the political impasse in Washington that has left the government without a budget. The decision was announcedSaturday by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel  The Associated Press reported.  Veterans: Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders introduced legislation to ensure that VA disability compensation checks and other earned benefits continue throughout any government shutdown. In a column for The Hill  Gary Augustine  executive director of legislation for the Disabled American Veterans  said the bill “need[s] to be brought up for [an] immediate vote  passed and signed into law.”  Republicans Plot Next Move: House Republicans are discussing a range of demands on fiscal issues they would seek as part of a broad budget agreement aimed at ending the standoff with Democrats and the White House  including cuts to entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security and a firm commitment to overhaul tax policy  according to lawmakers who have participated in Republican strategy sessions Congressional Quarterly reported.  The Obamacare Putsch: Shortly after President Obama started his second term  a loose-knit coalition of conservative activists led by former Attorney General Edwin Meese III developed a little-noticed “blueprint to defunding Obamacare ” signed by more than three dozen conservative groups. The New York Times said the plan articulated a take-no-prisoners legislative strategy to derail the health care overhaul if conservative lawmakers were willing to push fellow Republicans into cutting off financing for the entire federal government.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Democrats Already Compromised on Budget: The Senate-passed funding resolution to run the government represents a major compromise by Democrats who accepted more across-the-board cuts known as sequestration in order to avoid a costly government shutdown. "The continuing resolution  the $968 billion we passed  is much  much lower than it should have been " Sen. Bernie Sanders told Ed Schultz on MSNBC. "We did that in order to get [House Speaker John] Boehner to agree to avoid a shutdown."  Furloughed Workers Want Shutdown to End: Federal workers rallied outside of the Capitol on Friday to demand an end to the shutdown that has furloughed federal workers. Sen. Sanders spoke at the rally  MSNBC  WCAX-TV and Politico reported. Sanders told the crowd that the House would vote for a bill to reopen the government if only the speaker would allow a vote. "If Mr. Boehner brought that bill to the floor it would pass tomorrow. That's what he has got to do. Let's put our people back to work. Let democracy rule ” Sanders said on WPTZ-TV and New England Cable News.   Vermont Senators Back Guard Pay: Sen. Sanders wrote to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel expressing support for National Guard and reserve members to be treated like other military personnel and continue receiving pay during the shutdown  Roll Call  WFFF-TV and WVNY-TV reported.  Sanders Backs Veterans Benefits: Democrats have gone along with a few carve-outs to the shutdown  most notably agreeing to pay military salaries  but for the most part they have refused to entertain bills to open war memorials  fund the NIH  fund the veterans department and take other steps to reopen specific federal functions. Sen. Sanders has argued in favor of a bill funding veterans’ programs  but other Democrats say they must stand unified against what they have called GOP "gimmicks " The Washington Post reported.

Playing with Fire:   Three days into a government shutdown  Sen. Bernie Sanders said on Thursday that House Speaker John Boehner could break the impasse by letting the House vote on a Senate-passed resolution to fund the government.  Enough Republicans  weary of their own Tea Party fringe  would join Democrats and pass the bill. But Boehner so far has stood with  the far-right group that forced the government shutdown in the first place over a crusade to destroy the Affordable Care Act. Sanders voiced concern that the same tactics by the same small band of extremists could have more dire consequences if the nation’s debt ceiling isn’t raised by mid-October. (The debt ceiling is the amount the government may borrow to pay its bills.) Unless the ceiling is raised  the United States  for the first time in history  could default on its obligations and become “a deadbeat nation ” Sanders told radio host Ed Schultz. “These guys ” the senator warned  “are playing with absolute fire.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/playing-with-fire	HER	link	98.01	54.40	23.04	46.10	20.11	24.86	2.76	1.66	0.00	0.55	0.00	1.10	1.10	2.76	1.10	0.55	2.21	0.00	2.21	1.66	1.66	1.10	6.63	0.00	1.66	0.00	0.55	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00

Today’s news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   No End in Sight to Government Shutdown: Lawmakers and the White House dug in Tuesday for a long fight as the first federal government shutdown in nearly two decades showed no signs of breaking. The closure  triggered by a congressional fight over President Obama’s health care law  means 800 000 federal workers were off the job on Tuesday. Sen. Bernie Sanders said shutdown effects ranged from cancer patients not getting care they need to FBI agents are not reporting to work. Seventeen out of 30 staffers who work for U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders are off the job today  the Burlington Free Press reported.   No Surrender  Sanders Says: The process of closing down large parts of the U.S. government was under way on Tuesday after frantic rounds of late-night political sparring failed to avert the first federal shutdown in nearly two decades. Democrats in Congress hold Republicans to blame for using underhand methods to overturn a health care law passed by Congress  upheld by the Supreme Court and endorsed by voters at the last presidential election. “If we surrender to hostage-taking tonight ” Sen. Sanders said in The Guardian  “these guys would be back within a couple of weeks without a shadow of a doubt. What we are dealing with tonight is an extraordinary anti-democratic act.”   Hostage Crisis: “People may disagree about the Affordable Care Act  but it is wrong for right-wing Republicans to ignore the results of the last election and hold the American people hostage by threatening to shut down the government unless they get their way ” Sen. Sanders said in the St. Albans Messenger.   Closure Impact: Sen. Sanders said the government closure could be “devastating.” In Vermont  passport offices like one in St. Albans could close  people applying for federally-backed mortgages will face delays  programs to help small businesses and Head Start might shut down  and people applying for Social Security  Medicare and veterans’ benefits will face a significantly slower process  the Bennington Banner reported. The same article said Gov. Peter Shumlin expects only minor disruptions.   Americans are ‘Disgusted’: In an interview with WPTZ-TV  Sanders said “people are angry  they're upset and they're frustrated. They have every reason to be. What people want is for Congress to address the issues that are facing the American people and that's creating jobs and raising the minimum wage  dealing with the affordability of college and they're disgusted by what they're seeing.” Sen. Sanders told WCAX-TV that House Republicans are “holding the American people hostage.”   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/100213	HER	status	97.59	69.95	12.48	5.95	16.30	28.18	2.05	3.86	0.91	1.36	0.45	1.36	1.36	1.59	1.36	0.23	1.36	1.14	1.59	0.23	0.91	1.59	7.27	0.91	1.82	0.00	0.45	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Shutdown Begins: The first government shutdown in nearly two decades began at midnight after last-minute moves in Congress failed to break a bitter budget standoff over President Obama’s health care law. Sen. Bernie Sanders called the House attempt to undo Obamacare by closing the government “a precedent for blackmail that we cannot allow ” Vermont Public Radio reported. During an eleventh-hour interview on MSNBC  Sanders said Americans are “profoundly disgusted” because “a handful of right-wing extremists are trying to annul  do away with  the election results of a year ago. They haven’t quite caught on that Obama won.”   Devastating Impact: Sen. Sanders said the government closure could be “devastating” to Vermont and America. He said passport offices like one in St. Albans could close. People applying for federally-backed mortgages will face delays. Programs to help small businesses and Head Start might eventually shut down  WVNY-TV and WFFF-TV reported. “People who are to be applying for Social Security … Medicare …veterans’ benefits are going to have that process significantly slowed down ” Sanders added on WPTZ-TV.   Sanders: Shield Veterans: Sen. Sanders  chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs  introduced legislation Monday evening that would continue Department of Veterans Affairs funding for benefits and pensions even in the event of a protracted shutdown  The Washington Post and Military Times reported. Veterans also could experience significant delays when applying for new disability  education  pay and pension benefits  Sanders said in the Valley News.   Health Insurance Markets Open: Millions of Americans on Tuesday will begin shopping on the insurance marketplaces at the heart of President Obama's health care reforms. Sen. Sanders supported the Affordable Care Act but said the long-term solution to America's health care crisis is a single-payer national health care program. “The good news is that  in fact  a large scale single-payer system already exists in the United States and its enrollees love it. It is called Medicare … [and it] should be expanded to cover all Americans ” Sanders wrote in a column on The Huffington Post.

Shutdown:   As a midnight deadline passed  the U.S. government ran out of funds to keep much of the government running. The House on Monday repeatedly refused to vote on a Senate-passed bill to avoid a shutdown. Sen. Bernie Sanders decried the House push to use the shutdown as a lever – blackmail he called it –to try to block implementation of the Affordable Care Act.  Late in the night  President Barack Obama signed last-minute legislation to ensure that members of the military and personnel at the Department of Homeland Security get paid even during a shutdown.  Earlier Monday night  Sanders  the chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs  introduced legislation to ensure that benefits and pensions aren’t cut during a protracted shutdown.

Blackmail:   As the federal government hurtled toward a partial shutdown at midnight  Sen. Bernie Sanders said it would be devastating for thousands of federal employees in Vermont. “This is going to hit Vermont hard and it's going to hit America hard ” Sanders said in a Monday afternoon floor speech. “If a shutdown continues  it would be devastating for families who have kids in Head Start. If a shutdown continues  it would be devastating for seniors who are on the Meals on Wheels program ” he added. The impasse continued because House Republicans insisted on defunding or delaying Obamacare as part of any deal to avert a shutdown. Sanders welcomed a debate over health care  but blasted the tactics of right-wing Republicans in the House using a government shutdown to try to get their way. “What this debate is about is blackmail and hostage-taking ” he said  “and that is unacceptable.”  Watch the speech here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_DSPSFXKxs&feature=share&list=UUD_DaKNac0Ta-2PeHuoQ1uA	HER	video	92.24	72.17	7.49	10.80	18.89	29.41	1.76	2.94	0.00	0.00	2.35	0.59	1.18	2.94	2.94	0.00	2.35	1.18	2.94	1.76	1.76	0.59	3.53	1.76	0.59	0.00	0.59	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.59	0.00

At the Brink:   The U.S. government neared its first shutdown in 17 years after House Republicans early Sunday demanded a delay in implementing a new health care law as a condition for avoiding a shutdown. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid declared the House bill dead even before the post-midnight votes to delay President Obama’s health care law and repeal a tax to pay for it. Senate Democrats on Monday plan to table the Republican measures.

Sanders listed some of the effects of sequestration: 57 000 children knocked off Head Start; tens of thousands of seniors dropped from Meals on Wheels; cuts to housing assistance for the elderly and disabled; work-study programs cut for 70 000 college students; cancer patients losing Medicare treatments  and 400 000 elderly and other low-income households losing heating assistance this winter.   Tax Scam: Sen. Sanders is among 12 senators calling on the Justice Department to investigate tax-lien programs that in Washington  D.C. alone have cost dozens of families their homes. A Washington Post investigation found that investors bought tax liens and then charged homeowners legal fees and other costs that far exceeded the original tax bills. When homeowners were unable to pay  the investors foreclosed. One 95-year-old woman  Daisy Dolsey  lost a $300 000 house that had been in her family for half a century over a $44.79 tax debt.

War on Working Families:   With a government shutdown looming  the House set a Friday vote on a stopgap spending measure to run the government through Dec. 15. The continuing resolution would take away funds to implement the new Obamacare health care program. It also would extend automatic spending cuts  the so-called sequestration  in programs like Head Start and Meals on Wheels. “We are looking at a real effort to dismantle the United States government and wreak havoc on the lives of millions and millions of people ” Sanders said in a Senate floor speech. He discussed the budget showdown with radio host Ed Schultz. Then  later on  Thursday  the House narrowly voted to cut funds for food stamps. The senator talked about that moments after the vote with the Rev. Al Sharpton on MSNBC.  Watch Sen.

Summers Pulls Out:   Former Treasury secretary Lawrence Summers on Sunday withdrew as a candidate for Federal Reserve chairman to replace Ben Bernanke when his term runs out in January. The former Obama adviser faced mounting opposition in the Senate from  among others  Sen. Bernie Sanders.  “I applaud Larry Summers for withdrawing his name from consideration. The truth is that it was unlikely he would have been confirmed by the Senate ” Sanders said in a statement on Sunday. “What the American people want now is a Fed chairman prepared to stand up to the greed  recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street  not a Wall Street insider whose deregulation efforts helped pave the way for a horrendous financial crisis and the worst economic downturn in the country since the Great Depression. The Fed now must help develop policies which create millions of decent-paying jobs and rebuild the middle class.”  http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=E5D5F40B-6819-4024-BE61-AD279C967F49	HER	link	97.63	59.70	53.15	48.54	20.38	29.45	3.07	1.84	0.00	0.61	0.61	1.23	1.23	1.84	0.61	1.23	1.23	0.00	0.61	0.00	0.61	1.23	6.75	1.23	1.23	0.00	0.61	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.61	0.00
Don't Cave on Cuts:   The Senate must call the bluff of House Republicans who are demanding deeper cuts in Head Start  Meals on Wheels and other programs for working families  Sen. Bernie Sanders said on Sunday. A proposal set for a House vote this week includes the deeper spending cuts in a continuing resolution to keep the government from shutting down after the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1. The proposal would lock in across-the-board cuts known as sequestration but carve out an exception for the Pentagon  which would get a $20-billion boost.  A member of the Senate Budget Committee  Sanders said it would be a “tragic mistake” and a “terrible precedent” if the Senate were to go along with the House and further slash programs for children  the elderly  working families and the most vulnerable people in this country.   If the Senate accepts the House Republican plan  Sanders said in a letter to Senate colleagues  “more Americans will lose their jobs; more children will be thrown off of Head Start; more Americans will be unable to afford to send their kids to child care; more teachers will be thrown out on the street; more senior citizens will go hungry; and more working families will be unable to heat their homes this winter.  In the richest country on the face of the earth   that would be morally repugnant and bad economic policy.”   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=D6AAD261-CAB5-4085-B6FA-C44B67729CF6	HER	link	97.38	71.09	21.52	10.67	28.00	21.03	1.19	2.38	0.40	0.00	0.79	1.19	0.00	3.17	1.19	0.40	1.98	0.00	1.19	0.00	1.98	2.78	6.75	0.40	0.79	0.00	0.40	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.40	0.00

The American People Have Spoken: No More War Abroad  More Jobs at Home - Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)  Huffington Post:   At a time of great political division in our country President Obama has found a remarkable way to unite Americans of all political persuasions -- conservatives  progressives and moderates.  With a loud and clear voice the overwhelming majority of the American people  across the political spectrum  are saying NO to another war in the Middle East -- Syria’s bloody and complicated civil war.              There are two major reasons why the people in this country are adamantly opposed to the U.S.’s military intervention in Syria.                First  of course  is the much discussed “war weariness.”  The United States has been at war in Afghanistan for 12 years  and the war in Iraq dragged on for nearly nine years.  The cost of these wars has been horrendous: more than 6 700 American deaths; hundreds of thousands suffering from traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder; and a financial cost of between $4 trillion to $6 trillion by the time the last war veteran receives needed care.  Further  as a result of the ineptitude and dishonesty of foreign policy decisions made in Vietnam  Afghanistan and Iraq  the American people worry deeply about the unintended consequences of another military venture.                But there’s another reason why Americans are reluctant to get involved in a third Middle East war in 12 years.  And that relates to the fact that Congress today has a 14 percent favorability rating and millions of Americans have absolutely no confidence that the U.S. House or Senate is even remotely concerned about their needs or views.                Here’s the truth.  The middle class in this country is collapsing. The number of Americans living in poverty is nearly the highest on record and the gap between the very rich and everyone else is growing wider and wider.  And very few people in Washington give a damn.

Who Pays for Military Strikes Against Syria?:   While saying “there is no debate about the horrors of chemical warfare ”  Sen. Bernie Sanders on Wednesday said a drumbeat for military strikes against Syria “speaks to the degree to which Congress is way out of touch” with the priorities of the American people. He cited jobs and global warming among priorities that are important to Americans but lost in the debate on Syria. He also asked how a U.S. military intervention would be paid for. “We’ve cut back on education  we’ve cut back on nutrition programs  we’ve thrown kids off Head Start. We have billions to spend on a war but no money to take care of the very pressing needs of the American people. That bothers me a lot ” Sanders said.

The use of chemical weapons by the Assad dictatorship is inhumane and a violation of international law.  However  at this point in time  I need to hear more from the president as to why he believes it is in the best interests of the United States to intervene in Syria's bloody and complicated civil war. I look forward to the Senate debate that will be taking place in the very near future. - Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)

Wal-Mart on Wal-Mart:  A Wal-Mart spokesman on Monday told The Huffington Post that only 5 percent of the discount chain’s workers were on Medicaid. The spokesman was attempting to rebut Sen. Bernie Sanders’ assertion on MSNBC that the Walton family  the Wal-Mart owners  got to be the richest family in American by paying workers so poorly that they need Medicaid and food stamps to survive. What the spokesman may have forgotten to mention was that an internal memo to  Wal-Mart’s board of directors (obtained by The New York Times) acknowledged that 46 percent of the children of Wal-Mart's 1.33 million U.S. employees were uninsured or on Medicaid. The 2005 memo by M. Susan Chambers  Wal-Mart's executive vice president for benefits  had more to say about how the company treats its workers:  - Wal-Mart's workers are getting sicker than the national population with preventable diseases such as obesity (p. 4). More than half of Wal-Mart's workers (p. 8) are not covered by its health insurance plans  meaning many do not have access to necessary preventative care and doctors' visits. "Our workers are getting sicker than the national population  particularly with obesity-related diseases".  - Wal-Mart's workers aren't using primary care because so many of them lack coverage. Instead  they opt to use taxpayer-subsidized emergency rooms. The Wal-Mart workforce "tends to over utilize emergency room and hospital services and underutilize prescriptions and doctor visits".

Wal-Mart Welfare:   Who opposes raising the minimum wage? Wal-Mart. The discount chain made the Walton family the richest in American by paying workers so little they need food stamps to feed their families and Medicaid to pay their doctor bills. In an interview on Tuesday with Wolf Blitzer on CNN  Sen. Bernie Sanders made the case for raising the minimum wage to help workers at Wal-Mart and other employers that now pay starvation wages. A side benefit  Sanders added  would be that taxpayers wouldn’t have to subsidize the Waltons.

Wal-Mart Wages:  Opposition to raising the minimum wage in the United States comes from companies like Wal-Mart. While the Walton family that owns the giant discount retailer is worth about $100 billion  Sen. Bernie Sanders told Chris Hayes on MSNBC that the company pays its workers so little that they must resort to Medicaid  food stamps and subsidized housing. By paying workers so little  Wal-Mart “compels taxpayers to pick up a tab that wouldn’t even exist if the company paid its workers enough to get them out of poverty ” Harold Meyerson wrote in The Washington Post. To help workers and save taxpayers’ money  Sanders is a cosponsor of a bill to raise the minimum wage to $9 an hour.

Must Read: Big Lie: America Doesn't Have #1 Richest Middle-Class in the World... We're Ranked 27th! - By Les Leopold  The Huffington Post  America is the richest country on Earth. We have the most millionaires  the most billionaires and our wealthiest citizens have garnered more of the planet's riches than any other group in the world. We even have hedge fund managers who make in one hour as much as the average family makes in 21 years!  This opulence is supposed to trickle down to the rest of us  improving the lives of everyday Americans. At least that's what free-market cheerleaders repeatedly promise us.  Unfortunately  it's a lie  one of the biggest ever perpetrated on the American people.  Our middle class is falling further and further behind in comparison to the rest of the world. We keep hearing that America is number one. Well  when it comes to middle-class wealth  we're number 27.

Supreme Court Strikes Down Defense of Marriage Act:  The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that a 1996 law denying federal benefits to same-sex married couples is unconstitutional. The 5-4 decision was handed down by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy. Sen. Bernie Sanders welcomed the ruling. “This is good news for all Americans who believe in the words carved in marble on the front of the Supreme Court building  equal justice under law. But it is a special victory for gays and lesbians married in Vermont and the increasing number of other states that followed our lead in granting same-sex couples the same rights as everyone else ” Sanders said. Sanders in 1996 was one of only 67 House members who voted against the so-called Defense of Marriage Act  which denied federal benefits to gay spouses. He is a cosponsor of Senate legislation to repeal the law and he joined other members of Congress in a friend-of-the-court brief urging justices to void the discriminatory statute.

Must Read: Why I Don't Care About Edward Snowden - Ron Fournier  National Journal:   Is Edward Snowden a hero or a traitor? I don't care. You read right: I don't give a whit about the man who exposed two sweeping U.S. online surveillance programs  nor do I worry much about his verdict in the court of public opinion.  Why? Because it is the wrong question. The Snowden narrative matters mostly to White House officials trying to deflect attention from government overreach and deception  and to media executives in search of an easy storyline to serve a celebrity-obsessed audience.  For the rest of us  the questions seem to be:  Are the two programs revealed by Snowden legal and constitutional?  What else is the government doing to invade our privacy? Until a few days ago  paranoids were people who claimed Washington had cast a vast electronic net over our communications. Who isn't a bit paranoid now?  Why did the U.S. government for years debunk what they called a myth about the National Security Agency seizing electronic data from millions of Americans?  Why did the leader of the U.S. intelligence community mislead Congress in March by answering a question about the program in the "least untruthful manner" -- a phrase that would make George Orwell cringe.  Why do Democratic lawmakers who criticized President Bush for exploiting the post-9/11 Patriot Act now defend President Obama for curbing civil liberties?  Why do Republicans who defended Bush now chastise Obama for ruthlessly fighting terrorists?  Rather than fierce oversight  why did the White House and congressional leaders restrict full knowledge of the programs to a few elites  and stage  for the rest of Congress  Potemkin briefings? Why does a secret federal court almost always side with the government's requests to seize information?  Why didn't the president find a way before the leaks to tell the public in general terms what he was doing and why? Obama ran on a pledge of government transparency  opposed Bush-era surveillance tactics  and denounced the "false choice" between security and liberty.

We must not accept this economic 'new normal' - Sen. Bernie Sanders:   The front pages of American newspapers are filled with stories about how the US economy is recovering. There is some truth to that. Since President George W Bush left office in 2008  significant progress has been made in moving our economy out of the abyss of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. But in the midst of this slow recovery  we must not accept a "new normal".  We must not be content with an economic reality in which the middle class of this country continues to disappear  poverty is near an all-time high and the gap between the very rich and everyone else grows wider and wider.  The good news is that instead of losing more than 700 000 jobs a month as we were five years ago  we've been gaining almost 200 000 jobs a month since January. The bad news is that  in addition to those job numbers being much too low  nearly 60% of the jobs gained since the "recovery" are low-wage jobs that pay less than $14 an hour  while most of the jobs lost during the recession were decent-paying middle-class jobs.  The good news is that the official unemployment rate has gone down from 10% in October of 2009 to 7.5% in April. The bad news is that 20 million Americans still are looking for work and the real unemployment rate – counting those who have given up looking for work and those working part time when they need full time jobs – is 13.9% The very bad news is that youth and minority unemployment is far higher than that and  with the decline in factory jobs  income for poorly educated men has shrunk by nearly two-thirds over the past four decades.

It is an obscenity that people in this country are getting arrested at near record rates for smoking marijuana  but not one Wall Street CEO has been prosecuted for triggering the Great Recession in 2008. Millions of Americans lost their jobs  homes  life savings and ability to send their kids to college because of the greed on Wall Street. The failure to prosecute the crooks on Wall Street for their illegal and reckless behavior is a clear indictment of our broken criminal justice system.

I’m running for president of the United States because this country faces enormous crises. It’s too late for establishment politics or establishment economics. And what I mean by a political revolution is very simple. It means that no matter who gets elected president  that person could not accomplish alone what must be done—couldn’t be done—unless millions of people are actively participating in the political process.

The United States is experiencing a major human tragedy. We have more people in jail than any other country on earth  including Communist China  an authoritarian country four times our size. The U.S. has less than five percent of the world’s population  yet we incarcerate about a quarter of its prisoners – some 2.2 million people.  There are many ways that we must go forward to address this tragedy. One of them is to end the existence of the private for-profit prison industry which now makes millions from the incarceration of Americans. These private prisons interfere with the administration of justice. And they’re driving inmate populations skyward by corrupting the political process.  No one  in my view  should be allowed to profit from putting more people behind bars – whether they’re inmates in jail or immigrants held in detention centers. In fact  I believe that private prisons shouldn’t be allowed to exist at all  which is why I’ve introduced legislation to eliminate them.

We need a president who is going to represent middle income and working families of all colors in this country—not insult them. Making sure people have good-paying jobs  access to quality education  and a fair criminal justice system is not 'free stuff.' It's the foundation of a civilized society.  Jeb Bush should spend a little more time worrying about the 'free stuff' he wants to give to millionaires and billionaires—like Jeb Bush's tax plan that gives over half of its proposed income tax cuts to the top one-percent and raises the retirement age for Social Security.

South Carolina  not too long ago I introduced a bill in Congress to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. The simple truth is that working people cannot survive on $7.25 an hour. Yet more than 30 million people work every day for a minimum wage that is totally inadequate to provide for their families. What would a living wage mean for you?

Via Robert Reich - "I've had so many calls about an article appearing earlier this week in the Wall Street Journal -- charging that Bernie Sanders’s proposals would carry a “price tag” of $18 trillion over a 10-year period -- that it's necessary to respond.  The Journal's number is entirely bogus  designed to frighten the public. Please spread the truth:  (1) Bernie’s proposals would cost less than what we’d spend without them. Most of the “cost” the Journal comes up with—$15 trillion—would pay for opening Medicare to everyone. This would be cheaper than relying on our current system of for-profit private health insurers that charge you and me huge administrative costs  advertising  marketing  bloated executive salaries  and high pharmaceutical prices. (Gerald Friedman  an economist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst  estimates a Medicare-for-all system would actually save all of us $10 trillion over 10 years).  (2) The savings from Medicare-for-all would more than cover the costs of the rest of Bernie’s agenda—tuition-free education at public colleges  expanded Social Security benefits  improved infrastructure  and a fund to help cover paid family leave – and still leave us $2 trillion to cut federal deficits for the next ten years.  (3) Many of these other “costs" would also otherwise be paid by individuals and families -- for example  in college tuition and private insurance. So they shouldn't be considered added costs for the country as a whole  and may well save us money.  (4) Finally  Bernie’s proposed spending on education and infrastructure aren’t really “spending” at all  but investments in the nation’s future productivity. If we don’t make them  we’re all poorer.  That Rupert Murdoch's Wall Street Journal would do this giant dump on Bernie  based on misinformation and distortion  confirms Bernie's status as the candidate willing to take on the moneyed interests that the Wall Street Journal represents. Your thoughts?"	HER	status	90.01	69.48	18.43	67.88	24.15	28.98	3.50	1.27	0.32	0.00	0.00	0.64	0.96	3.18	1.27	2.87	3.50	0.32	0.00	0.00	3.50	0.32	4.14	1.59	0.32	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.32	0.00	0.32	0.00

"Bernie joined workers in a picket line today at a plant in Iowa. The last candidate for president I recall joining a picket line was Robert F. Kennedy in 1968.   For years labor unions have been marginalized or castigated by Republican politicians  and taken for granted by Democratic ones. Every four years the Democratic candidate for president promises organized labor that he or she will push hard for labor law reform once in office  but nothing ever happens. In 2008  Obama committed himself to the "Employee Free Choice Act " which would have strengthened labor protections and enabled workers to organize with a simple majority in an up-or-down vote -- but Obama never followed through. In 1992  Bill Clinton promised labor that if elected he'd make labor law reform a central issue -- but Clinton never pursued it.   Bernie is making stronger promises. He believes  accurately  that the decline of organized labor (from 33% of the private sector workforce in 1955 to less than 7% today) is directly related to the decline of the American middle class. If elected  I believe he'll follow through."

The current federal minimum wage is a starvation wage  and it must become a living wage. It is a national disgrace that millions of full-time workers are living in poverty and millions more are forced to work two or three jobs just to pay their bills.

Today  we live in the wealthiest nation in the history of the world but that reality means very little for most of us because almost all of that wealth is owned and controlled by a tiny handful of individuals. In America  we now have more income and wealth inequality than any other major western industrialized country on earth  and the gap between the very rich and everyone is wider than at any time since the 1920s.

Chicago gave hundreds of high-risk kids a summer job. Violent crime arrests plummeted - Washington Post:  In a year full of distressing stories — especially about race  crime and violence in urban neighborhoods — this one points to some hope. Earlier this December  we covered a summer jobs program in Chicago that appeared to lead to fewer teenage arrests for violent crime. Our original story  republished below  also reminds us that policy solutions are possible — and possibly even inexpensive.  A couple of years ago  the city of Chicago started a summer jobs programfor teenagers attending high schools in some of the city's high-crime  low-income neighborhoods. The program was meant  of course  to connect students to work. But officials also hoped that it might curb the kinds of problems — like higher crime — that arise when there's no work to be found.  Research on the program conducted by the University of Chicago Crime Lab and just published in the journal Science suggests that these summer jobs have actually had such an effect: Students who were randomly assigned to participate in the program had 43 percent fewer violent-crime arrests over 16 months  compared to students in a control group.  That number is striking for a couple of reasons: It implies that a relatively short (and inexpensive) intervention like an eight-week summer jobs program can have a lasting effect on teenage behavior. And it lends empirical support to a popular refrain by advocates: "Nothing stops a bullet like a job."

An economic agenda for America - Sen. Bernie Sanders  The Des Moines Register:   The American people must make a fundamental decision. Do we continue the 40-year decline of our middle class and the growing gap between the very rich and everyone else  or do we fight for a progressive economic agenda that creates jobs  raises wages  protects the environment and provides health care for all?  Are we prepared to take on the enormous economic and political power of the billionaire class or do we continue to slide into oligarchy? Those are the most important questions of our time. The answers will determine our country’s future.

An Economic Agenda for America: 12 Steps Forward - Sen. Bernie Sanders  The Huffington Post:   The American people must make a fundamental decision. Do we continue the 40-year decline of our middle class and the growing gap between the very rich and everyone else  or do we fight for a progressive economic agenda that creates jobs  raises wages  protects the environment and provides health care for all? Are we prepared to take on the enormous economic and political power of the billionaire class  or do we continue to slide into economic and political oligarchy? These are the most important questions of our time  and how we answer them will determine the future of our country.  The long-term deterioration of the middle class  accelerated by the Wall Street crash of 2008  has not been pretty. Today  we have more wealth and income inequality than any major country on earth. We have one of the highest childhood poverty rates and we are the only country in the industrialized world which does not guarantee health care for all. We once led the world in terms of the percentage of our people who graduated college  but we are now in 12th place. Our infrastructure  once the envy of the world  is collapsing.

Must Read: Democracy Day - Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)  The Huffington Post:  This week I introduced legislation to make Election Day a national holiday -- Democracy Day.  I am doing this because  as a nation  we should be embarrassed by the abysmally low voter turnout that we experienced in last week's midterm elections.   In 1863 at Gettysburg  Abraham Lincoln described our democratic form of government as one "of the people  by the people and for the people." And where are we today? Are we "of the people  by the people  and for the people" when 60 percent of those people didn't vote and 80 percent of young and low-income people failed to vote? Are we a government "of the people  by the people and for the people" when poll after poll shows that most Americans can't even name the political parties that control the U.S. Senate and U.S. House or who their members of Congress are? Are we a government "of the people  by the people and for the people" when billionaires can spend unlimited amounts of money to elect candidates to represent their interests?

You Can Make a Difference – Vote:   The midterm election takes place in a couple of days and my request is simple. Please vote and please do everything you can to encourage a large voter turnout.  As a member of the U.S. Senate I can assure you that if Republicans win this week and take complete control of the U.S. Congress  it would be disastrous for the American people — in so many ways.  The Republican Party  under the influence of the Koch brothers and other billionaire families  continues to call for major cuts in programs desperately needed by working families. Unbelievably  in this very tough economy  many Republicans want cuts to Social Security  Medicare  Medicaid  education  nutrition and environmental programs. They are vigorously opposed to any increase in the minimum wage or a major jobs program that would put the unemployed back to work.

Bernie Sanders vs. the Billionaires - Andrew Prokop  Vox:   On a recent Sunday morning in Waterloo  Iowa  about 150 people filed into the local arts center to hear a speech by the United States’ only socialist senator. Vermont’s Bernie Sanders  white-haired and 73 years old  spoke for about an hour in his gravel-voiced  thick Brooklyn accent. His views are  he said  “a little different than most views.” Sanders denounced the power of the wealthy  advocated for single-payer health care and the public funding of elections — and called for a “political revolution” in America.  The crowd of mostly-elderly  liberal Iowans seemed to like the senator’s pitch. When Sanders said the top 25 hedge fund managers last year made more money than 425 000 public school teachers  many gasped. When he said Wall Street bankers were “too big to jail ” many clapped. And when he opened the floor for questions  one from a younger audience member  Rachel Antonuccio  led to particularly loud cheers. “I have a very simple question ” she said to Sanders. “Will you please run for president?” Once Sanders quieted the applause  he didn’t give the standard politician’s coy non-response. He admitted that he’s “given thought to” running  saying he was motivated by the “enormous problems” the US faces — but he then quickly veered into his misgivings. - “I’m not much into hero-worship and all this stuff ” he said. “If somebody like me — or me — became president  there is no chance in the world that anything significant could be accomplished without the active  unprecedented support of millions of people  who would be prepared to make a commitment — the likes of which we have not made!”  Read more: http://www.bernie.org/news/vox-bernie-sanders-vs-billionaires/ 	HER	link	88.84	74.32	14.97	76.56	19.40	21.99	3.44	0.69	0.00	0.00	0.34	2.41	2.06	1.37	3.44	1.03	3.78	1.03	4.12	0.34	1.03	1.03	5.15	0.00	0.34	0.00	0.34	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.34	0.34

Sanders Addresses Hundreds in Iowa - James Lynch  The Gazette:   Heading into the final month ahead of the 2014 midterm election  Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders exhorted fellow progressives to plug away at the unglamorous nuts-and-bolts of the campaign against a “billionaire class whose greed knows no bounds.”  “Everyone in this room understands participating in the political process is the most patriotic thing we can do ” Sanders  the U.S. Senate’s longest-serving independent  told about 400 people Sunday at the Johnson County Democratic barbecue.  The polls and prognosticators may paint a bleak picture for the party in the Nov. 4 election  he said  “but if we stand together  there is nothing we cannot accomplish for our great country.”  Read more here: http://www.bernie.org/news/sanders-iowa-october/	HER	link	95.89	80.12	29.06	39.52	21.67	29.23	1.54	0.77	0.00	0.77	0.00	1.54	0.77	0.77	2.31	1.54	3.08	1.54	0.77	0.00	4.62	1.54	3.08	1.54	0.00	0.00	0.77	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00

Must Read: The Threat to American Democracy - Sen. Bernie Sanders and Sen. Tom Udall  POLITICO:  We are at a pivotal moment in American history.  Building the United States of America has been long  arduous and rife with setbacks. But throughout the years  we have undoubtedly moved forward toward a more inclusive democracy. We expanded the right to vote. We eliminated the poll tax. We banned corporations from donating to campaigns after the scandals of the Gilded Age and imposed stricter limits on donations and expenditures after Watergate.  But today  those improvements are in serious jeopardy. The Supreme Court struck down a major part of the Voting Rights Act and Congress has yet to pass a fix. Voter ID laws are the new poll taxes. And thanks to years of pressure from conservative activists  five members of the Supreme Court have destroyed more than a century of campaign finance laws.

The political crisis of our time is that the billionaire class has been successful in creating a situation in which millions of working families either vote against their own best interests  or don't vote at all. The rich get richer and hire lobbyists to get them more tax breaks. The poor get poorer  and are not organized to fight for higher wages and better jobs. Our job is to change that dynamic. Please give me your ideas as to how we can do that. - Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)

Could A Socialist Senator Become A National Brand? - Ailsa Chang  NPR:  As members of Congress continue hammering out a bill to improve the Department of Veterans Affairs’ beleaguered health care system  attention has focused on one man leading the charge: Bernie Sanders  Independent senator from Vermont and a self-described socialist.  Sanders barely got 2 percent of the vote when he first tried breaking into Vermont politics in the 1970s  but now there’s buzz that the man known simply as “Bernie” may be a presidential candidate in 2016.  “The cost of war is huge ” he said recently during lunch at Henry’s Diner in Burlington  Vt.  where he rose to become an immensely popular mayor in the 1980s. “It’s not just tanks and guns and planes. It’s what happens to people’s lives.”  Sanders’ frizzy hair may have gotten whiter since his mayoral days  but it could still use a comb. And when he opens his mouth  you don’t hear New England — you hear Brooklyn.

The Declaration of Independence: A Revolutionary Document - Sen. Bernie Sanders  The Huffington Post:  As we celebrate this July 4th weekend  it's important that we not forget the profound vision embodied in the Declaration of Independence.  "We hold these truths to be self-evident  that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are Life  Liberty  and the pursuit of Happiness; that  to secure these rights  governments are instituted among Men  deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed; that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends  it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it  and to institute new government  laying its foundation on such principles  and organizing its powers in such form  as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness."  Today  while the very rich become richer  the poor become poorer and the middle class disappears  the top 1% owns more wealth than the bottom 90%  and 95% of all new income goes to the top 1%.

If You Were An Iraq War Critic  You're Probably Not Being Asked To Go On TV - Sam Stein & Michael Calderone  The Huffington Post:   WASHINGTON -- Kent Conrad’s phone hasn’t been ringing very much over the past few weeks  as Iraq  and the debate over America's future in the country  has once again dominated the news.  The architects of the Iraq war are back in TV studios and on op-ed pages  as are journalists and pundits who promoted the Bush administration’s ultimately bogus case for invading. But Conrad  a former senator who was one of only 23 to vote against authorizing the war in October 2002  hasn’t heard from CNN  MSNBC or any other TV outlet. "Not once " he said  when asked if anyone in the press had reached out regarding the current crisis in Iraq.  In an email to The Huffington Post  Conrad  a North Dakota Democrat  offered two possible explanations. The first  he said  is “simply the incompetence of the media.” The second is "the shrillness of those trying desperately to rewrite history to cover their own devastating failures."

Protect Net Neutrality:   At a time of increased corporate control over the media and the flow of information  it is absolutely imperative that the Internet remain on a level playing field  open to all.  Whether you are a major news corporation or a one-person blogging operation  whether you are Walmart or a family-owned small business  there should be net neutrality for all.  Right now the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is considering a rule that would allow large Internet providers like Verizon and Comcast to charge businesses for faster access to Internet users. This rule would give large corporations yet another advantage over small Internet companies and average citizens. These types of pay-to-play agreements will end the democratic foundation of the Internet  and strike a major blow against the free flow of ideas.  Join me and my colleague Senator Al Franken in protecting net neutrality so that big telecom can’t pick winners and losers online.   Our free and open Internet has made invaluable contributions to democracy here in the United States and around the world. We must not allow the FCC to let big corporations to turn a profit by putting a fee on the free flow of ideas.  Please  join me to protect net neutrality. Add your name today!

CEO Pay Has Increased By 937 Percent Since 1978 - Rebecca Hiscott  The Huffington Post:  A new report by the Economic Policy Institute shows that CEO compensation at the largest corporations has ballooned by 937 percent since 1978  when adjusted for inflation. A typical worker’s compensation grew a measly 10.2 percent over the same period.  The average CEO compensation at the 350 publicly owned companies with the largest annual revenue in the U.S. last year was $15.2 million  according to the EPI  a left-leaning think tank. That’s a 21.7 percent rise since just 2010.  These massive increases are fattening CEOs' wallets while those of average Americans look ever leaner. Of all income groups  it's arguably minimum-wage earners who have suffered the most. The federal minimum wage has declined sharply since the 1960s when adjusted for inflation. If it had kept pace with increases in workplace productivity  the federal minimum wage would be $21.72 an hour -- triple what it is today.  Meanwhile  median CEO pay among large public companies broke eight figures for the first time last year  according to a recent Associated Press/Equilar study.  In 2013  according to the EPI's study  the average CEO-to-worker compensation ratio was nearly 296-to-1.

Why Democrats Need Bernie Sanders to Run for President - Michael Kazin  The New Republic:   Bernie Sanders may actually run for president. The feisty Senator from Vermont is giving dinner speeches in Iowa  telling journalists he’s “prepared” to campaign  and is deciding whether he wants to compete for the Democratic nomination or take the “radical” step of heading an independent ticket. Assuming he rejects the Naderish option  which would upset many of his admirers who recall the 2000 debacle  a Sanders run could be excellent news for Democrats—in the next presidential race and beyond.  At a minimum  it would make the Democratic primary about more than the deeds and personality of Hillary the inevitable. Sanders  as eloquent a voice of left-wing populism as exists in the land  would press Clinton to support doubling the current minimum wage  imposing higher taxes on the wealthy  and increasing entitlement payments instead of reducing them in a “grand bargain” with Republicans. He would also push her to explain how she would end the dominion of big money in politics  long one of his signature issues. Sanders has introduced a constitutional amendment that would overturn the Supreme Court’s decision in the Citizens United case.  According to multiple polls  these are all popular positions—among independents as well as Democrats. But without a shove from the left  Clinton is likely to stick to a mushy moderation  hoping a lengthy battle inside the GOP will result in a nominee too right-wing for the majority of the electorate to stomach.

Must Read: US Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont launches Progressive Democrats of America 10th anniversary - Gena Mangiaratti  Daily Hampshire Gazette:   NORTHAMPTON — Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders does not believe his support for the working class makes him unusual.  Though he finds that many people who call themselves progressives believe they are in the minority  he does not believe this about himself  he said.  “Every idea I ever espoused  I believe  is what the vast majority of our country believe ” Sanders told a crowd of around 400 people who filled the sanctuary at First Churches Friday for “A Conversation with Senator Bernie Sanders ” an event sponsored by The Nation magazine  Progressive Democrats of America  and radio station WHMP.  “The Koch brothers and their friends are a small minority. Never  ever forget that ” Sanders said.  The independent senator was invited to Northampton by Tim Carpenter  founder of the Progressive Democrats of America  to speak as part of the national organization’s 10th anniversary celebration. Carpenter  of Florence  died April 28 at the age of 55.

Join U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and Progressives United in telling the Supreme Court that corruption is corruption!  In McCutcheon  just like in Citizens United  the Roberts majority of the Supreme Court essentially legalized corruption  first by corporations and now by super-wealthy individual donors.  When Russ Feingold joined with John McCain and passed campaign-finance reform  they did it because huge  unlimited checks were corrupting our government. Unfortunately  today’s conservative court  in 5-4 votes  embraces corruption.  The more corporate money is allowed to corrupt our government  the more elected officials are beholden to the rich and the powerful  the harder it becomes to win fights for working Americans. Corruption affects everything. Corruption makes it harder to pass an increase in the minimum wage  to expand Social Security benefits  to reverse climate change and to block the horrible trade deals that send jobs overseas. Corruption means letting Wall Street run wild.  Stand with U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and Progressives United and tell the Supreme Court that we cannot allow the billionaire class to buy our elections!

Bernie Sanders for president? -  It’s the longest of long shots  but that doesn’t mean he won’t do it. - Jaime Fuller  Washington Post:   If Hillary Rodham Clinton or Jeb Bush or Ted Cruz admitted they were seriously considering starting a presidential campaign  it's hard to overstate how much of a media response that would provoke. When Bernie Sanders announces that he's been thinking about 2016  the same hysteria doesn't hold.  The senator from Vermont  isn't surprised. Although reporters have always been enamored of his hair -- which starts to resemble Charlton Heston parting a sea when Sanders begins passionately speaking about income inequality or Social Security -- and his gruff unwillingness to tell anecdotes lest you write about his personality rather than his policies  his political ambitions are rarely taken seriously.  With presidential candidates now relying on raising millions from small donors and big donors — besides having one  two or three outside groups raising millions on the side — a candidate who has made fighting big donors and outside groups part of his platform seems to have pre-written his campaign's death knell. Sanders has never accepted corporate PAC money  and the average donation to his campaign during the first quarter of 2014 was $28.95.

Who Are the Koch Brothers and What Do They Want? - Sen. Sanders  The Huffington Post:  As a result of the disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision  billionaires and large corporations can now spend an unlimited amount of money to influence the political process. The results of that decision are clear. In the coming months and years the Koch brothers and other extraordinarily wealthy families will spend billions of dollars to elect right-wing candidates to the Senate  the House  governors' mansions and the presidency of the United States. These billionaires already own much of our economy. That  apparently  is not enough. Now  they want to own the United States government as well.  Four years ago  the Supreme Court handed down the 5-4 ruling in Citizens United vs the Federal Election Commission. A few weeks ago  they announced another horrendous campaign finance decision in McCutcheon vs. FEC giving even more political power to the rich. Now  many Republicans want to push this Supreme Court to go even further. In the name of "free speech " they want the Court to eliminate all restrictions on campaign spending -- a position that Justice Thomas supported in McCutcheon -- and a view supported by the Chairman of the Republican National Committee. Importantly  as a means of being able to exercise unprecedented power over the political process  this has been the position of the Koch brothers for at least the last 34 years.  The Koch brothers are the second wealthiest family in America  making most of their money in the fossil fuel industry. According to Forbes Magazine  they saw their wealth increase last year from $68 billion to $80 billion. In other words  under the "anti-business"  "socialist" and "oppressive" Obama administration  their wealth went up by $12 billion in one year.

‘Horrible’ Supreme Court Ruling  Sanders Says - Vermont Public Radio:   “They are dead wrong ” Sen. Bernie Sanders said about the Supreme Court’s decision on Wednesday that struck down a major provision of the nation’s campaign finance law. By a 5-to-4 vote  the justices removed the cap on the total amount of money that donors can contribute to candidates and parties in each election. Prior to Wednesday’s ruling in McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission  the aggregate limit was $123 000.

Supreme Court Undermines Democracy by Allowing Billionaires to “Buy Elections” - Democracy Now!:   As the 2014 election season gets underway  the Supreme Court has struck down a long-standing limit on how much donors can give to federal candidates  political parties and political action committees in a two-year election cycle. Without any aggregate limit  a donor can now give millions directly to candidates and parties. The 5-to-4 decision in the McCutcheon v. FEC case is being described as the “next Citizens United ” referring to the 2010 ruling that opened the floodgates for unlimited corporate spending on U.S. elections. We speak to Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont about Wednesday’s landmark decision and his fight to remove big money from the electoral process. We also discuss Sanders’ potential presidential run in 2016  which he says he is considering “not because I wake up in the morning with a burning desire to be president … but [because] I happen to believe there are such enormous issues out there that I just don’t want to see swept under the rug.”  Continue reading here: http://www.bernie.org/news/sen-bernie-sanders-supreme-court-undermines-democracy-allowing-billionaires-buy-elections/	HER	link	92.84	63.83	23.51	72.99	24.75	31.82	3.03	0.51	0.00	0.51	0.00	2.53	3.03	1.01	1.01	0.51	1.52	0.51	1.01	0.51	2.02	1.52	6.06	1.01	0.00	0.00	0.51	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.51

Check out U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders' letter entitled "A Huge Victory " which discusses how we beat back relentless attempts to cut Social Security benefits  and the lessons we can learn from that.  In his letter Bernie says  "Perhaps most importantly  however  was the role played by grass-roots organizations. A massive coalition representing millions of Americans came together including senior groups  unions  veterans’ organizations  women's groups  civil rights groups  disability organizations and others. Petitions were signed  calls to Congress were made  emails were sent and demonstrations and rallies were held. In essence  grass-roots America made an offer that members of Congress could not afford to refuse. We told them we knew what was going on and there would be a political price to pay if they ignored us. And they didn't."  In his letter  Bernie also points out how this strategy can be used pro-actively  not just reactively. He urges us to educate and organize around such issues as the need to create millions of new jobs  raise the minimum wage  extend long-term unemployment benefits  make college affordable  reverse global warming  move toward progressive taxation and expand the social safety net.

Below please find a portion of Bernie's statement:  "During the last week a new and important ally has arisen in the struggle against unfettered capitalism and wealth and income inequality.  In his recently published Exhortation  Pope Francis warns the world against the idolatry of money and the false promise of trickle-down economics.  "Clearly  not everyone shares Francis’ religion  and many of us have deep differences with a number of positions taken by the Catholic Church.  Nonetheless  we can all  I think  share his commitment to economic justice and learn from his wise assessment of how modern civilization  in its relentless pursuit of profit and its dependence on “the market” to make final valuations of what is good  has lost touch with the ethical imperatives that should guide our society.  I appeal to other religious leaders to focus on matters of economic justice and to speak out from the context of their own respective traditions."  Click below to read Bernie's entire statement.

Is wealth and income inequality the moral issue of our time? Senator Bernie Sanders wants to know what you think.   Click below to give Bernie your thoughts.  Should government address the issue?  What are the best ways forward?  In a recent statement  Bernie said:  “In America today  the top 1 percent owns 38 percent of our country’s financial wealth. The bottom 60 percent owns 2.3 percent. The increasing wealth inequality in the United States has become the great moral issue of our time.  In America today  one family  the Walton family of Wal-Mart  owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent  and the top 400 individuals have more wealth than the bottom half of our country -- over 150 million people.  In terms of income  the top 1 percent earns more than the bottom 50 percent  while the wealthiest 16 000 Americans  who make more than $10 million a year (the top 0.01 percent)  saw their income increase by nearly a third between 2011 and 2012.  According to a recent study  from 2009 to 2012  95 percent of all new income went to the top 1 percent. Meanwhile  since 1999  median family income declined by more than $5 000 after adjusting for inflation.  Today  a record-breaking 46.5 million people live in poverty in the United States. At 21.8 percent  we have the highest rate of childhood poverty in the industrialized world. One out of four of our kids now lives in a family that receives food stamps.  Poverty among seniors is growing. Over 9 percent of seniors lived in poverty in 2012  higher than in 2009. More American seniors were living in poverty last year than in 1972.  In recent years  while median family income has declined and poverty has increased  the number of millionaires and billionaires has grown at an extraordinary rate. In 1996  there were 121 billionaires in America. Today  there are 442.”	HER	link	99.00	73.66	80.99	73.09	15.05	19.94	2.53	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	1.58	0.63	0.63	0.32	0.32	3.16	0.32	0.63	0.00	3.48	2.22	10.13	0.95	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.95	0.00

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) issued the following statement today on the 11-day-old government shutdown and the debt ceiling:  “The Republicans must stop holding the American people hostage.  Speaker Boehner must allow the House to vote so that they reopen the government and pay our bills. Frankly  given the enormous problems facing this country  it is beyond belief that we have wasted weeks debating whether  for the first time in our history  the largest economy in the world should default and plunge the world into a severe financial crisis.  “Yesterday  the Republicans were using the Affordable Care Act as the reason why they had to shut down the government and not pay our bills. Today  it’s ‘reforming’ Social Security  Medicare and Medicaid. What will it be tomorrow?  “Social Security  which is independently funded through the payroll tax  has nothing to do with the deficit.  The deficit -- which has been cut in half since 2009 -- was significantly caused by the Bush wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy and the Wall Street-induced recession  which led to a significant decline in federal revenue.  “The Republican Party and Paul Ryan cannot be allowed to get their way by threatening the American people with a continued government shutdown and a default unless Congress cuts Social Security  Medicare and Medicaid.  That is not what the American people want.  Rather  we should be passing legislation which rebuilds our infrastructure and creates millions of new jobs  address the crisis of low wage employment by raising the minimum wage  make college affordable and fight for equal pay for equal work."

"It is not acceptable that a handful of right-wing extremists in the House have shut down the government and are now pushing for the United States  for the first time in our history  to not pay its bills -- precipitating a likely international financial crisis.  It is widely believed that there now exists in the House a majority of members (virtually all Democrats and some moderate Republicans) who are prepared to vote for a clean continuing budget resolution which would immediately re-open the government.  House Speaker Boehner must allow the House to have that vote.  "It is also important that people understand that the real issue here is not just the desire of Republicans to defund Obamacare. At a time when the middle class is collapsing and poverty is increasing  these right-wing ideologues want to repeal virtually every piece of legislation passed in the last 80 years which protects the elderly  the children  the sick  the poor and the environment.  The truth is that ending Obamacare is just a small part of the right-wing extremist agenda  which is heavily funded by the Koch brothers and other very wealthy and powerful special interests.  Their full agenda includes privatizing Social Security  ending Medicare as we know it  slashing Medicaid funding  eliminating the EPA and the Department of Energy and abolishing the concept of the minimum wage.  Needless to say  they also want more tax breaks for the rich and large corporations.  It should be clear to everyone that their long-term goal is to move this country into an oligarchic form of society in which billionaires completely control the economic and political life of this nation."  -U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT)	HER	video	86.12	61.14	18.17	77.74	28.30	24.73	3.53	0.71	0.00	0.00	0.00	1.77	0.71	2.12	1.41	2.47	1.41	0.35	0.71	0.35	1.77	1.06	5.65	0.71	1.06	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00
The truth is that the current government shutdown and the willingness of right-wing Republican extremists to default on the U.S. debt for the first time in American history is part of a right-wing ideological agenda which goes far beyond defunding the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).

No question about it  Denmark and the United States are very different countries. Nonetheless  are there lessons that we can learn from Denmark?  "In Denmark  social policy in areas like health care  child care  education and protecting the unemployed are part of a "solidarity system" that makes sure that almost no one falls into economic despair."

"As a result of the Government Accountability Office (GAO) audit of the Fed  Senate sponsor Bernie Sanders of Vermont said  'We now know that the Federal Reserve provided more than $16 trillion in total financial assistance to some of the largest financial institutions and corporations in the United States and throughout the world.' Among the investigation's key findings was that the Fed unilaterally provided trillions of dollars in financial assistance to foreign banks and corporations from South Korea to Scotland. These decisions were all made without the public  media or elected officials' knowledge  and they would have remained secret without an audit.  "In addition  the audit found conflicts of interest. For example  the CEO of JPMorgan Chase served on the New York Fed's board of directors at the same time that his bank received more than $390 billion in financial assistance from the Fed. Sanders urged that 'No one who works for a firm receiving direct financial assistance from the Fed should be allowed to sit on the Fed's board of directors or be employed by the Fed.'"

Momentum is building toward reforming "too big to fail" banks. Check out Matt Taibbi's recent article for Rolling Stone:  "Last week  Sanders announced plans to introduce an interesting new bill  one that's a direct response to comments made recently by the likes of Eric Holder about the difficulty in prosecuting big banks. Holder said some institutions have grown so large that prosecuting its executives may have a "negative impact on the national economy  perhaps even the world economy."  "...What the Sanders bill would do is force Holder and the White House to actually spell out the policy. It would give Treasury Secretary Jack Lew 90 days to compile a list of all the financial institutions that they think are too big to prosecute. The list would include "any entity that has grown so large that its failure would have a catastrophic effect on the stability of either the financial system or the United States economy without substantial government assistance."  "But this isn't an isolated thing. Bernie's bill comes on the heels of a series of developments that  to me anyway  signal a shift in thinking on this issue on the Hill."

Senator Bernie Sanders needs your help NOW.  Republicans  some Democrats and President Obama are pushing the concept of a chained CPI  a backdoor way to make substantial cuts in Social Security and benefits for disabled veterans.  Incredibly  they are arguing that the COLAs that seniors receive for Social Security are too generous. Bernie and many economists believe they are not generous enough.  If a chained CPI goes into effect  seniors who are 65 now will receive $650 less a year at 75 and would get $1 000 less a year at age 85.  Veterans who started receiving VA disability benefits at age 30 would have their benefits reduced by over $3 000 a year at age 65.  Bernie recently told the Associated Press  "I do not believe that the American people want to balance the budget on the backs of disabled veterans or widows who lost their husbands in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan."

Earlier today  Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) introduced a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court’s disastrous Citizens United decision.  In his statement  Bernie said  “What the Supreme Court did in Citizens United is to tell billionaires like the Koch brothers and Sheldon Adelson  ‘You own and control Wall Street. You own and control coal companies. You own and control oil companies. Now  for a very small percentage of your wealth  we're going to give you the opportunity to own and control the United States government.’ That is the essence of what Citizens United is all about. That is why this disastrous decision must be reversed.”  The amendment would prevent corporations from bankrolling election campaigns  and unlike an amendment introduced in the previous session of Congress  the new amendment would prohibit both for-profit and non-profit corporations from funneling unlimited sums of money into the political process.  Non-profit corporations were responsible for funneling much of the “dark money” into last year’s election.

Earlier today  Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) introduced the “Keeping Our Social Security Promises Act ” which would eliminate the cap on the payroll tax for those earning more than $250 000  and thus strengthening Social Security for at least the next 50 years.  In his statement  Bernie said:   “Social Security is the most successful government program in our nation's history. Through good times and bad  Social Security has paid out every benefit owed to every eligible American.   "The most effective way to strengthen Social Security for the future is to eliminate the cap on the payroll tax on income above $250 000 so millionaires and billionaires pay the same share as everyone else.”   Before Social Security was passed into law 77 years ago  nearly half of all seniors lived in poverty.  Today  less than 10 percent  live in poverty.  Applying the Social Security payroll tax on income above $250 000 would only affect the wealthiest 1.3 percent of Americans and would keep the retirement program strong for at least another 50 years.  The bill is cosponsored by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) as well as Sens. Patrick Leahy (D-VT)  Barbara Boxer (D-CA)  Amy Klobuchar (D-MN)  Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI)  Al Franken (D-MN) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT).  There is also a companion bill in the House sponsored by Rep. Peter DeFazio of Oregon.  More than 320 organizations throughout the country representing over 50 million Americans support the bill including the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare  the AFL-CIO  United Steelworkers  Alliance for Retired Americans  Social Security Works  Campaign for Community Change and  The Arc.

Bernie Sanders issued the following statement in response to the State Department's recent report  which paves the way for approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline from Canada:  “No one who is serious about protecting the future of our planet and reversing global warming could support this pipeline project. Tar sands oil is the dirtiest on Earth  and the Environmental Protection Agency has said clearly that tar sands production releases 82 percent more greenhouse gas emissions than conventional oil.  “President Obama spoke eloquently in his Inaugural Address and State of the Union about the need to take action to reverse global warming. It’s now time to turn words into action. The president cannot tell us that he is concerned about global warming and approve the Keystone XL project. I again call on the president to reject this dangerous project and continue moving our nation toward energy efficiency and sustainable energy.  “It is bad enough that some people in Washington deny the overwhelming scientific evidence and claim that global warming is a hoax and a Hollywood conspiracy. In my view  it would be equally absurd to claim concern about global warming while then approving decisions that will literally throw fuel on the fire of this planetary crisis. The president must reject the Keystone XL project.”	HER	link	88.43	64.59	17.62	69.79	21.40	28.04	5.14	2.80	0.47	0.00	1.40	1.40	0.93	1.87	0.47	0.93	0.93	0.47	0.93	3.74	1.87	0.47	4.67	0.47	2.80	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00
Last week Senator Bernie Sanders  an independent member of the Democratic caucus  was the only member of that caucus to vote NO on the so-called filibuster reform package passed in the U.S. Senate.  Below is Bernie’s statement on why he voted NO.  January 24  2013 U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT)  "This country faces major crises in terms of the economy and unemployment  the deficit  global warming  health care  campaign finance reform  education and a crumbling infrastructure – to name a few.  In my view  none of these problems will be effectively addressed so long as one senator can demand 60 votes to pass legislation. The rule changes adopted today are a step forward in making the operations of the Senate more efficient and expeditious.  They are not enough.  "Most Americans grew up believing that in America the majority rules.  That is not the case in the Senate. For many years now  especially since President Obama has been in office  it has taken 60 votes to pass any significant piece of legislation. When Lyndon Johnson was majority leader in the 1950s  he filed cloture to end a filibuster only once.  Majority Leader Reid has filed cloture 390 times.  "The Senate is not the House and the minority party must be treated with respect and given the opportunity to offer amendments and make their case in opposition.  A minority must not  however  be allowed to permanently obstruct the wishes of the majority.  That is not democracy.  That is a perversion of democracy.  "In my view  if a senator or a group of senators are strenuously opposed to legislation they have the right and duty to come to the floor and  for as long as they want  engage in a talking filibuster by explaining to the American people the reasons for their objection.  They should not  however  continue to have the right to abuse arcane Senate rules to block a majority of senators from acting on behalf of the American people."

Dear Friends   With your support we won a huge victory last night -- with over 71% of the vote.  Thank you so much for standing with me  and thank you for demanding that Congress start representing all of the people and not just billionaire campaign contributors.  Yesterday was a great day  and I suspect that the right-wing extremists of this country did not wake up this morning feeling very well.  Against the efforts of dozens of billionaires  the President was re-elected and some great Progressives were elected and re-elected to the Senate.  The election is over  but this country continues to face enormous problems.  In my view  these problems will not be satisfactorily addressed unless we build a strong and energetic grass-roots movement.  You are part of that movement.  You can continue to make an enormous difference.  I look forward to continue working with you in the months and years ahead.  Once again  thank you for your support.  You made all the difference.

We have the most unequal distribution of wealth and income since the 1920s and more than any other major country on earth. Today  the top 1% own 40% of all wealth  while the bottom 60% owns less than 2%. Today  the richest 400 American families own more wealth than the bottom 150 million Americans.

I know that many of you are deeply concerned about the economy  health care  education  global warming and the environment  Social Security and Medicare  civil liberties  war and peace and the national debt.  But here’s an issue that’s even more important because it encompasses all of these issues – and much more.

Or  will “democracy” simply become another commodity owned and controlled by billionaires and corporations in order to serve their own purposes?

What Donald Trump said about Megyn Kelly after the first Republican debate was offensive  and it deserves the kind of reaction that it's getting from so many others—but if we focus on that  we're making a mistake. What a lot of the men on that stage in the debate said was offensive: some very radical and offensive positions when it comes to women's lives  women's reproductive health  women's opportunities.    When one of the GOP’s major candidates  Marco Rubio  says there should be no exceptions for rape and incest in a ban on abortion  that is as offensive and as troubling a comment as you can hear from a major candidate running for the presidency. The language may be more colorful and more offensive when it comes from one candidate  but the thinking  and the attitude  toward women is very much the same as the rest—it's just delivered in a different package. What they say about women should not be forgotten.   So yes  it makes great TV. Trump went way overboard: offensive  outrageous  pick your adjective. But what Rubio said has as much of an impact in terms of where the Republican party is today as anybody else on that stage. And it is deeply troubling  and it should be to the press  not just to those who fight for women’s health and rights.

Seven years ago today  Hillary and then-Senator Obama came together in Unity  NH after a hard-fought campaign—the start of a partnership that would continue in the President's administration. In Hillary's words: "People all over the world have asked me: 'How could you and President Obama work together after you fought so hard against each other in that long campaign?'

My thoughts and prayers are with my dear friend Sheryl Sandberg and her family as they endure this tragic loss. The remarkable outpouring of memories and tributes are a testament to what a brilliant  generous  and dynamic man Dave Goldberg was. Together  Sheryl and David reminded us that leaning in is a whole lot easier when you have someone you can lean on. As Sheryl said  David was her rock. They supported one another  inspired each other to think bolder and dream bigger. And she’s right: David is still with her and with all of us in spirit. For that we can always be grateful. –H	HER	status	36.11	97.58	5.35	98.46	13.25	18.87	7.55	1.89	0.00	0.00	1.89	3.77	0.00	0.00	1.89	1.89	0.94	0.00	1.89	0.00	6.60	0.94	0.94	0.00	0.94	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00

Mom.  The most beautiful word in the English language.  For most of us  the very first words out of our mouths as infants.  "MaMa."    When actors or athletes win awards (like Kevin Durant just this week)  their most passionate thank you is always to Mom.  As a child  Mom can cure everything.  There is no safer place than in your mother's arms.    My Mom  Eleanor Darragh  is a woman of incredible strength  independence  and compassion.  She fought her father  a difficult man who didn't believe women should be educated  to become the first person in her family to get a college education.  She stood up to him  and graduated from Rice in 1956 with a degree in math.  She went to work at Shell as a computer programmer in the 1950s  blazing an independent path.  Every day  she has been there for me.  She's been a best friend all my life.  She's peaceful  loving  and never judgmental.  She's a prayer warrior  lifting us up every single day.  And she loves unconditionally.    No image makes me happier than seeing our girls Caroline and Catherine leaping through the air to land in her lap.  Pure joy  for them and her (and me!).  I love you Mom.  And  of course  my radiant wife Heidi  who's Mom to our precious girls.  My Angel.  Heidi is amazing.  She's beautiful  brilliant  passionate  and always unbelievably supportive  no matter how challenging the road we're on.  As I wrote to her in her card this morning  "I need you.  Like Air.  I cannot breathe without you."  Caroline and Catherine adore their Mommy.  Sure  Dad's ok  but he doesn't hold a candle to Mom  who is  bar none  their very best friend.  Today  all of us celebrate the women in our lives who make us who we are.  Today  we celebrate the love that is like oxygen.  Today  all of us say thank you Mom.  We love you.  Ted.

Today the Texas Legislature is holding a hearing on requiring outside groups to disclose their donors to engage in political speech. That would be a disastrous policy that would unconstitutionally chill free speech.   President Obama and U.S. Senate Democrats have been trying to enact this wrongheaded law for years at the federal level. And the IRS just received 150 000 comments overwhelmingly against its proposed rules to force groups to disclose their donors.   The Texas Legislature should not enact these pernicious laws at the state level.

Pete Ricketts is a friend and will make an outstanding Governor. I’m proud to endorse him. Pete is a businessman and a constitutional conservative who will help Nebraska thrive. He helped grow his family business through vision  innovation  and tireless work. He’ll bring that same spirit to state government. Pete’s priorities for tax reform  job growth and education reform will expand opportunity for Nebraskans.  I especially admire Pete’s strong principled leadership in support of school choice  working to empower parents and expand the educational options for every child in Nebraska. And I appreciate Pete’s opposition to amnesty and support for the rule of law. Pete will be a strong  independent advocate for Nebraska families and communities.

Today Christians across the globe join together to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ.  We are truly blessed to live in a nation where we can freely practice our faith  but at the same time there are many across the globe who don’t enjoy that same freedom.  Our fellow American  Pastor Saeed Abedini  is being imprisoned in Iran for simply practicing his Christian faith. He is serving an eight year sentence and has been so badly treated he is currently confined to a hospital bed. Despite the brutal darkness he faces in Iran  he has found comfort in the Kingdom of Light.   This Easter  he wrote an incredibly powerful message. Please read it and keep Pastor Abedini  and all prisoners of conscience across the world  in your thoughts and prayers today. #SaveSaeed	HER	link	82.21	91.35	8.80	97.70	16.50	23.48	6.82	1.52	0.00	0.76	0.00	1.52	0.00	0.00	0.00	1.52	1.52	1.52	0.00	0.00	6.06	3.03	1.52	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00

Last night  voters in Texas demonstrated that they want principled conservatives in office. Tea Party activists  Republican women  libertarians  and young people all rallied around insurgent candidates campaigning to listen to the people and get serious about free-market principles and the Constitution. In race after race  the power of the grassroots was overwhelmingly apparent.  Congratulations to every Republican who won the primary last night. Three  in particular  deserve special mention.  Greg Abbott  a close friend and mentor  won a landslide victory in the primary for governor. He's strong  principled  and courageous. For five and a half years  it was an honor to work side-by-side with Abbott. He will make an outstanding governor.  John Cornyn  our senior senator  won his primary as well. John is a friend  and a good man. He's earned considerable respect in the Senate. We have not agreed on everything  but we have agreed on the vast majority of issues. Together  we're a strong and effective team for Texas.  George P. Bush convincingly won his primary for for Land Commissioner. George was one of my very first supporters in our Senate race  and he and his wife Mandi are long-time friends. He's smart  generous  and has a heart for service. George embodies a new generation of leaders for the Republican Party and for Texas.  Congratulations to all three. I'm proud to endorse all three and urge everyone to support the Republican nominees up and down the ballot come November.

Courage and a love of liberty have long been defining characteristics of the Texas spirit. Both were exemplified 178 years ago when fifty-nine delegates convened in Independence Hall at Washington-on-the-Brazos to declare Texas' independence.  Inflamed by General Santa Anna's refusal to abide by the Mexican Constitution of 1824 and inspired by the United States’ first Declaration of Independence  the men produced their own Declaration and resolved ‘that the people of Texas do now constitute a free  Sovereign  and independent republic.’  The same love of ‘life  liberty  and property of the people’ that spurred the Texians at the Alamo and throughout the Revolution still lives in each Texan today. They fought for it. They died for it. We owe it to their sacrifice to carry the torch of freedom for future generations. And we will.  Keep that resolve strong and when anyone threatens our liberties  proudly say  as only a Texan can  ‘come and take it!’	HER	link	93.99	88.38	16.24	99.00	17.67	24.53	8.18	1.26	0.63	1.26	0.00	2.52	3.14	0.00	0.63	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.63	0.00	3.14	2.52	3.77	0.63	0.63	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.63

It's altogether fitting that President Obama is today talking about income inequality because income inequality has increased dramatically as a direct result of his economic policies. Out-of-control government spending  debt  taxes  and regulations have killed millions of jobs. Unfortunately  rather than stop Washington's job-killing policies  President Obama proposes yet more government spending and debt. People need jobs. All of America needs to be a real 'Promise Zone'--with reduced barriers to small businesses creating private-sector jobs--and we should start by repealing every word of Obamacare  building the Keystone pipeline  abolishing the IRS  and rolling back abusive regulations.

Free Speech Matters  The reason that so many Americans love Duck Dynasty is because it represents the America usually ignored or mocked by liberal elites:  a family that loves and cares for each other  believes in God  and speaks openly about their faith.     If you believe in free speech or religious liberty  you should be deeply dismayed over the treatment of Phil Robertson. Phil expressed his personal views and his own religious faith; for that  he was suspended from his job. In a free society  anyone is free to disagree with him--but the mainstream media should not behave as the thought police censoring the views with which they disagree.  And  as PC enforcers often forget  tolerance is a two-way street. Here's what Phil himself had to say about accepting and loving everybody:  “I myself am a product of the 60s; I centered my life around sex  drugs and rock and roll until I hit rock bottom and accepted Jesus as my Savior.  My mission today is to go forth and tell people about why I follow Christ and also what the bible teaches  and part of that teaching is that women and men are meant to be together.  However  I would never treat anyone with disrespect just because they are different from me. We are all created by the Almighty and like Him  I love all of humanity. We would all be better off if we loved God and loved each other.”	HER	status	41.91	78.20	13.36	99.00	24.40	18.44	8.20	2.05	0.00	0.41	0.00	2.87	2.46	2.46	3.28	2.05	4.10	0.82	1.64	0.00	4.51	1.23	3.28	0.41	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00

Nelson Mandela will live in history as an inspiration for defenders of liberty around the globe.

Because of his epic fight against injustice  an entire nation is now free.   We mourn his loss and offer our condolences to his family and the people of South Africa.

Today  we celebrate the blessings of a people dedicated to liberty.  Our forefathers fled religious prosecution to pursue the freedom of conscience in the New World  a bedrock principle we must continue to protect.  As the pilgrims in their November 1620 Mayflower Compact  their very first governing framework  wrote: “[We] solemnly and mutually  in the Presence of God and one another  covenant and combine ourselves together into a civil Body Politick  for our better Ordering and Preservation.”  A year later they thanked God for his providence  their first harvest  and a new land of opportunity. It was the nation’s very first Thanksgiving.  Despite the many trials they faced  they expressed gratitude for the opportunity to live freely.  President Calvin Coolidge reminded us nearly a century ago: “We have been a most favored people. We ought to be a most generous people. We have been a most blessed people. We ought to be a most thankful people.”  And  we are.  This Thanksgiving  Heidi and I wish you and your family the very best  and may God continue to bless the Great State of Texas and the United States of America.

On this Hanukkah  I wish our Jewish friends a happy holiday.  The miracle of the oil reminds us of God's provision in times of trouble. The little vessel that kept burning for eight days embodies the hope of a courageous people. Their piety and perseverance through adversity is an inspiration to many. Their steadfastness speaks to their faith in a greater future.  Last week  I had the honor of attending an event celebrating Emma Lazarus  the poet who wrote the words that welcome all to this land of liberty: 'Give me your tired  your poor  Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free  The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these  the homeless  tempest-tossed to me  I lift my lamp beside the golden door!'  We are grateful for the rich history the Jewish culture brings to America and to the world  and I hope you have a blessed Hanukkah season.

According to the interim agreement regarding Iran’s nuclear program that was reached this weekend in Geneva  not one centrifuge will be destroyed. Not one pound of enriched uranium will leave Iran. Not one American unjustly detained in Iran's notorious prisons will be released. But Iran will start to receive  in a matter of days  $7 billion in relief from international economics sanctions.  All the smiling embraces between diplomats after the interim deal was signed notwithstanding  the Iranian regime remains a brutal and oppressive dictatorship that pursues nuclear weapons for the purpose of dominating the Middle East and threatening America and our allies  notably Israel. President Obama and Secretary Kerry should reconsider their policy of rapprochement with Iran that is dismaying to Jerusalem and encouraging to Tehran. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu predicted this agreement would be a 'very  very bad deal' and has now correctly identified it as an 'historic mistake.' Meanwhile  Iranian President Hassan Rouhani tweeted his satisfaction as the 'breaking down the architecture for sanctions has begun.' The administration has gotten it backwards and it is time to reverse course before any further damage is done.

On the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918  the fighting between the Allies and Germany ceased. Today  we commemorate that moment by thanking our veterans who have continued the quest to preserve our peace and freedom.  We should all be proud of our country’s long tradition of service. General John J. Pershing eloquently expressed his thanks in a letter to the troops who helped win the “war to end all wars ” that is just as relevant now as it was then.  Pershing wrote  “By willing sacrifice of personal rights; by cheerful endurance of hardship and privation; by vigor  strength and indomitable will  made effective by thorough organization and cordial co-operation  you inspired the war-worn Allies with new life and turned the tide of threatened defeat into overwhelming victory.”  We are so fortunate that throughout history  millions of Americans have come forward to fight tyrants  fascists  communists  and terrorists to keep us free.  Still  we live in a violent world  where the freedoms we enjoy remain exceptional to millions of less fortunate forced to abide by brutal dictators  oppressive regimes  and cultures of intolerance.  The persistent threats of terrorism at home and abroad are reminders of how precious it is to be an American and how fiercely our rights must be protected.  We are blessed to live in a society where men and women continue to fight for our flag. Since the terrorist attacks of 9/11  more than 3 million Americans have volunteered to defend their country  knowing full well the risks they may face. More than 50 000 are serving in Afghanistan right now.  They  like millions of veterans before them  are willingly putting themselves in danger to keep us safe.  Thank you.  President Calvin Coolidge once said  “The nation which forgets its defenders will itself be forgotten.” He was right.  Please join me on this Veterans Day in saying a prayer of thanks for our veterans. And  please find a veteran. Grab their hand. Look them in the eye and tell them  “Thank you for your service.”  We will never be able to express enough thanks for the troops  but they must always know they are treasured.  May God bless the veterans  may God bless all those who continue to protect our country  and may God bless the United States of America.

Twelve years ago  America’s resolve was tested. In the years since  many have fought tirelessly to preserve the principles that have made this country the greatest the world has ever known. As promised  our military men and women have hunted down terrorists who perpetrated these horrific acts. Justice has been served.  Yet  the threat of radical Islamic terrorism remains real  as evidenced in Syria  Benghazi  Boston  and Fort Hood. We must remain vigilant and fiercely protective of our way of life.  Today is a day for solemn reflection on what it means to be an American and to express our profound gratitude for all those who have sacrificed their lives for that cause. As we pay tribute to the victims of terrorism  mourn with their families  and give our thanks to all who have served  let us also come together and renew our pledge that America always remain the land of the free and the home of the brave.

Throughout our history  Americans have been recognized all over the world for their work ethic and optimism. This Labor Day  let's commit ourselves to restoring that image.   Republicans  Democrats  conservatives  independents  and progressives should unite to create more jobs and opportunities. That begins by defunding and repealing Obamacare  the biggest job killer in modern history.  Once we defund and then repeal Obamacare  American businesses can get back to business  and American workers can get back to building the American dream. There is no reason that it cannot once again be "morning in America."  The American people know what needs to be done; Washington just needs to listen.  We are Americans. We know how to get a job done. But first  there must be jobs to do.   God Bless America.

I commend President Obama for listening to bi-partisan calls for him to seek congressional authority before any possible use of force against Syria. Given that the President did not request an emergency session of Congress  that must mean that he agrees there is no imminent threat requiring the Commander in Chief to act without consulting the representatives of the American people.  I remain concerned that the mission proposed by the President is not in furtherance the vital national security interests of the United States. To date I have heard a great deal from the administration about punishing Bashir al-Assad for violating an “international norm” through the use of chemical weapons  and that this is why we must act against him. Abstract notions about international norms should never displace U.S. sovereignty to act  or refuse to act  for our national security.  Assad’s murderous actions have claimed the lives of more than a hundred thousand of his own people  which is a humanitarian tragedy. But our chief strategic concern should not be international norms; it should be preventing the chemical weapons from falling into the hands of al Qaeda or other terrorists who might use them against us and our allies.  It is now incumbent upon President Obama to make his case and persuade Congress that his plan is necessary  and the best course to preserve our security and protect our liberties. Like the President  I welcome this debate and I agree this is an issue of the highest seriousness that transcends partisan politics.

I hope and pray this verdict will bring some peace to Nidal Hasan's victims and their families. But if we ever hope to defeat the ongoing threat from radical Islamism  we need to start by calling this terrorist attack on our armed forces by its name.

I applaud Mark Levin for his book and for being unafraid to propose these thoughtful constitutional amendments.  Mark’s book sparks an important discussion about how to fix the problems that face our Republic as a result of bad policies  judicial activism and the erosion of federalism.     I think many of his proposed constitutional amendments have merit and intend to work with my colleagues in the Congress and the American people to make commonsense constitutional reforms  like a Balanced Budget Amendment  a reality.

Unfortunately  all of the concerns that have been repeatedly raised about this bill remain: it repeats the mistakes of the 1986 immigration bill; it grants amnesty first; it won’t secure the border; and it doesn’t fix our broken legal immigration system.  This bill doesn’t solve the problem because the process it went through was fatally flawed– it was written behind closed doors with special interests; in the Judiciary Committee  the Gang of 8 and Democrats blocked all substantive amendments because of a previously cooked deal; and on the Senate floor  the majority blocked any attempts to fix the bill.  Further  in conjunction with Obamacare  the Gang of 8 bill creates a tax enalty on employers – effectively  up to $5 000 – for hiring U.S. citizens or legal immigrants. But that penalty does not apply to those with RPI status  giving a powerful incentive for job creators to hire illegal immigrants instead of U.S. citizens or legal immigrants. That is indefensible. I filed an amendment to fix this defect  but was blocked by Senate Democrats from receiving a vote on that solution.  Sadly  this bill won’t fix the problem with our immigration system and will only encourage more illegal immigration and human suffering.  I strongly support commonsense immigration reform that secures the border before legalization  fixes our legal immigration system  and upholds the rule of law. This bill isn’t it.

Today’s Supreme Court decisions on marriage are a regrettable overreach against the will of the people as expressed through large  bipartisan majorities in Congress and directly through referendum in California – a markedly blue state.  Nothing in the Constitution compelled this result  and  once again  the Court has chosen to substitute its own views of public policy for the democratically expressed will of the voters.  The family is the fundamental building block of society  and I strongly support traditional marriage between one man and one woman. The voters of California made that same choice  until the courts improperly substituted their preferences for those of the people.  Our Federalism allows different states to make different policy judgments based on the values and mores of their citizens. Federal courts should respect that diversity and uphold that popular sovereignty  not impose their own policy agenda.

I have proposed an amendment to the Gang of Eight Bill that defunds Obamacare in order to prevent a penalty for hiring citizens and legal immigrants over immigrants granted amnesty under the bill.  The authors and proponents of this bill claim to recognize this is an issue and support efforts to fix it  but have failed to do so.

Today  the Supreme Court recognized the enormous progress made toward voting equality in the United States since the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965. The Court rightly decided that the statutory standards used decades ago to subject democratically-elected state legislatures to second-guessing by unelected federal bureaucrats no longer survives constitutional scrutiny.  Today's decision also validates the hard work and personal sacrifice made by my late friend and former Texas solicitor general  Greg Coleman. Greg's tireless and brilliant advocacy on this issue no doubt paved the way for this result  and I am grateful for his principled legacy.

From the east side of the Brandenburg Gate  President Obama gave an extraordinary speech today sketching out his plans for a new global order in which traditional national security interests will be replaced by a collective approach to everything from global warming to nuclear weapon capability.  The irony  of course  is that President Obama was free to stand on the formerly-Soviet side of the Brandenburg Gate and opine about global peace with justice because of the strength of the very nuclear arsenal he now proposes to dismantle. While the President claimed today that at the end of the Cold War  “Openness won. Tolerance won. And freedom won here in Berlin ” the reality is that the United States of America won. The Berlin wall did not come down simply because the German people dreamed of freedom. The Berlin came wall down because an American President distilled his policy towards the Soviet Union into a simple formula: “We win  they lose.”  If history be our guide  although the notion of “peace with justice” that the President mentioned ten times in his speech may sound appealing  we will be far better served by President Reagan’s policy of “peace through strength ” which cannot be achieved by appeasement or yet another round of nuclear cuts by the Obama administration.

I'd like to wish all the fathers out there a wonderful Father’s Day. Take your kids to the park  hug them tightly  tell them you love them  and thank God for them and for His many blessings on your family. There’s no more important job than being a father  and a strong  loving Dad gives every child the foundation he or she needs to brave this world.   My own Dad has been my hero my entire life. He is a man of faith and deep integrity  a man who loves liberty with all his heart. His truly American story of fleeing oppression in Cuba with nothing more than $100 to his name and finding success through hard work and perserverence has inspired me my entire life. Today  my Dad is a pastor  and through his life I have seen every day his love and faith in Jesus. Each Dad should endeavor to reflect our heavenly Father’s love for us  and my Dad has done that throughout my life.  Five years ago  I became a Dad myself  and I learned firsthand just how strong a father’s love could be. There is nothing I would not do for my two daughters. I continue to fight each and every day to preserve this Shining City on a Hill for them–-working to ensure that my girls inherit the same blessed land of liberty and opportunity that each of us has been so priviliged to enjoy–is what keeps me going. For the first time in American history  our children are facing growing up in a country that may well be worse off than it was for the previous generation. This is completely and utterly unacceptable; we cannot selfishly spend away the futures of our children. And I know millions of mothers and fathers across the State share that very same commitment  to turn our country around.

Agriculture forms the backbone of the Texas economy and is an integral part of our proud heritage  as it is for the rest of the nation. Unfortunately  the current farm bill gives far less attention to the needs of farmers than it does to politicians and special interests. For an issue as critical to our nation's safety and American livelihoods as ensuring a reliable food supply  I am disappointed that Washington's cynical politics have again trumped any real reform.  Any meaningful support for farmers in this trillion dollar bill is unnecessarily held hostage to the unchecked growth of food stamp entitlements and numerous other programs unrelated to farming. This farm bill costs 60 percent more than the 2008 bill. Nearly 80 percent of it is comprised of food stamps. It fails to provide a true safety net for difficult years  fails to fully target assistance to those most in need  and fails to prioritize farm aid over duplicative programs  subsidizing unrelated programs from green energy to housing.  We should address the true needs of American farmers  but the bill considered by the Senate does much more harm than good. I hope our House colleagues will include needed reforms that the Senate omitted in its flawed consideration of this important issue.

We should always be mindful of the need for government to have the tools necessary to keep Americans safe in a dangerous world  where there are enemies plotting to attack us. We have seen the face of that enemy time and again  most recently in the terrorist attacks at Fort Hood  Benghazi and Boston to name a few.  But on one hand the Obama Administration says this enemy is in retreat  yet on the other  they are implementing what appears to be an unprecedented and intrusive surveillance system on private American citizens in the name of guarding against that enemy. Just today  the president encouraged us to trust him on this – to trust that there are safeguards to ensure our privacy is protected  trust that there is a system of checks and balances to prevent an abuse of power. But in light of this Administration's track record  how can they expect to be trusted?  We have discovered over the past few months an ongoing pattern of wanton disregard not only for Americans' privacy  but for the truth – DOJ's refusal to be forthcoming about drone policy  IRS's targeting groups for their political beliefs and then misleading the American people about it  DOJ's targeting of journalists for doing their jobs  and now what seems an unprecedented intrusion into Americans' personal phone records and potentially into their broader online activities.  Americans trusted President Obama when he came to office promising the most transparent administration in history. But that trust has been broken and the only way to earn it back is to tell the truth. That's what Americans deserve. I will be working with my colleagues in the Senate who share my concerns to ensure that we have all the facts about these surveillance programs  and that our government is appropriately balancing concerns of national security with Americans' personal liberties.

Today’s unfortunate U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Maryland v. King  by a vote of 5-4  expands government power  invades our liberty  and undermines our constitutional rights. The Court held that the police can forcibly take DNA samples from people who have been arrested—but have not been tried or convicted—of a serious offense. So now the government can capture  without a search warrant  the most personal information about an individual  and use it to search vast databases for unrelated offenses.  All 50 States already collect DNA from convicted felons. So this intrusion of liberty will matter only for those not convicted: the innocent and wrongly accused or those for whom there is insufficient evidence to convict.

Six years ago next week  Jon Stewart first let me come on his show to talk about how the biggest banks on Wall Street had just broken our economy. And bless him  even though I had such gut-wrenching stage fright that I threw up back stage  Jon has invited me back year after year – as a law professor  a government advisor  a candidate and a senator – to talk about how we’re fighting to level the playing field. So it’s bittersweet for me to tell you that tonight I’ll be back on The Daily Show for the sixth time  for what could be my last time before Jon Stewart retires later this year.

The biggest banks on Wall Street have made it clear that they expect a return on their investment in Washington.

It’s no surprise to read that David Axelrod was the person behind President Obama’s “Yes We Can” slogan  because Axe is a true believer. He believes with all of his heart that government is important  public service matters  and we are stronger when we come together to build a future for all of our children. Axe’s terrific new book Believer tells the story of his 40 years of campaigns and service  from his work for Gov. Deval Patrick to his time in the White House helping the President fight for the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. He shows that even when things are tough  even when the playing field is tilted  even when we could lose  we keep fighting for what we believe in.

Coming out of the Great Depression  our country was at a crossroads. We made the decision together to invest in ourselves  in our kids  and in our future – and for nearly 50 years  it worked. And then in the 1980s  our country moved in another direction  and we found ourselves living in a very different world – one where the rich just got richer  and everyone else was left behind. No one spoke more powerfully about what was happening to America’s struggling middle class than Governor Mario Cuomo. We will miss his voice  we will miss his heart  and we will miss his passionate fight for working families.

Mitch McConnell admitted that his #2 priority after repealing the Affordable Care Act is to gut the new rules we passed to hold Wall Street accountable. It’s a one-two punch to leave families on their knees while the big banks rake in bigger and bigger profits. Just imagine what Washington would look like with a Republican-controlled House and Senate bought and paid for by the millionaires  billionaires  and Wall Street. We need to fight back to protect the Democratic majority in the Senate. http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/09/republican-senate-would-gut-elizabeth-warren-consumer-protection-bureau	HER	link	95.28	81.12	11.28	43.65	20.40	22.55	1.96	0.98	0.00	0.98	0.00	1.96	0.98	2.94	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.98	0.00	0.00	2.94	0.00	8.82	0.98	1.96	0.00	0.98	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00

Since 2009  the big banks and financial institutions have paid at least $128 billion to regulators for the tricks and traps that brought down our economy. But they are happy to pay the fines – in fact  JP Morgan gave its CEO Jamie Dimon a 74% raise for negotiating its settlement. If these settlements are so weak that Wall Street is celebrating  it's not a good deal for the American people. That's why I introduced the Truth in Settlements Act to require accessible  detailed disclosures about settlement agreements. Just a couple weeks ago  the bill made it through the Senate Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs Committee and can now receive a full Senate vote.

Even Wall Street admits: Student loan debt is crushing home ownership. College graduates who owe more than $50 000 in student loan debt are 8% less likely to own a home than their classmates. When young people can't buy homes  start small businesses  or save for retirement  our entire economy suffers.

Today is President Barack Obama's birthday  which seems like a good time to remind the anarchy gang in Congress about the reality of the world they’re living in.   Back in 2012  the Republicans tried to win the presidency. They picked their candidate  spent a zillion dollars  made their best case to the American people  and lost to President Obama by five million votes.   Five million votes. And they didn’t vote for the President by such a wide margin so that the Republicans could hold the government hostage until 2016  or 2020  or 2024  or whenever they think they can win the presidency again. And they didn’t vote for President Obama so that Congress could waste time and taxpayer money on foolish stunts like lawsuits and impeachments.   Here’s the deal: Congress is supposed to do its job every day. We shouldn’t stop working to make the lives of millions of Americans better just because we don’t like the political party in charge – and we shouldn’t make Block-the-President a political game that takes priority over helping get this country working better for working people.   It’s time for the Republicans in Congress to remember that it’s their job to work with President Obama – on his birthday and every day. Happy Birthday  Mr. President!

Then Saturday we hiked from the Jug End Road trailhead on the Appalachian Trail and ate our lunch on a rock outcrop overlooking some beautiful country. Bruce and I are long-time members of the Appalachian Mountain Club  and it's great to see their work on the trails. Saturday night  we went to Jacob's Pillow Dance  the much-celebrated dance center in Becket. They hosted Mark Morris  one of the country's best choreographers  and the program was spectacular. Then yesterday  Bruce and I headed to the The Clark Art Institute  the Williamstown gem that just reopened a couple of weeks ago. The new wing and the extraordinary outdoor spaces give a new freshness to the amazing art collection.

I just saw this summary of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's work  and I couldn't resist passing it along. http://www.consumerfinance.gov/blog/three-years-of-standing-up-for-consumers/  We got this agency because people across this country fought the big banks and their lobbyists and demanded it. And now this agency is paying off for millions of Americans who have a fighting chance to get treated fairly and  if they don't  they have a fighting chance to do something about it.    On the way home tonight  I bought a cupcake  put three candles on it  and made a wish for the continued independence and strength of the agency. Tomorrow we'll get back to work to make sure no one messes with this agency. Thanks for being part of this.

Today is the fourth anniversary of Dodd-Frank  the law that established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau -- and the third anniversary of the date the CFPB became an independent agency. Sure  there is a lot of financial reform work left undone. But I celebrate the progress we’ve had so far: When big banks have to listen to their customers a little more  the playing field starts to level out just a little bit more.

When I was a little girl  James Garner came to visit my school. Mr. Garner was a famous movie star  and my third-grade teacher was his relative -- and when he came by the school we were all lined up outside to meet him.  I remember that he touched my shoulder  and I was sure he had smiled at me. He was the first person I'd met from the big world outside  and he was living proof that if you worked hard and played by the rules  some pretty amazing things could happen. I’m sorry he's gone.

Like a lot of little girls  I loved my daddy dearly. I loved to do things alongside him. When I was nine  he taught me to paint  letting me manage the main part of repainting our front door. When I was ten  he let me help him tar the roof on the carport he built. I was so proud that he thought I was big enough and dependable enough to help.    Through the years we put up a new ceiling in the living room  hung wallpaper  and dug up flower beds together. Daddy was a quiet man  but when we worked  he would talk about the widest range of things. After I was married and had my own house  we kept up our projects. Several years ago  I rescued an old floor lamp from a dumpster. We cleaned it up  and I can still hear him telling me to hold the pieces steady as he fished through the new wiring. That was also when he told me that the cancer had come back.   My daddy worked hard his whole life.  He sold fencing and carpeting  and ended up as a maintenance man. He and my mother never had much  but he said that his life was a success because his four kids had more opportunities than he had.   Happy Father's Day to all the dads trying to give their kids a fighting chance to succeed.

The decision of how tough to be when a big bank breaks the law should not be delegated from governors to staff of the Federal Reserve. Yesterday  Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen confirmed that she is taking steps to make sure the Fed’s Board of Governors takes direct responsibility for major enforcement decisions. These are positive steps  and I hope more of our regulators follow suit and take responsibility for enforcing the law.

Rep. Pete Sessions (R-TX) just said that extending unemployment benefits is “immoral." Really? Helping people stay in their homes and feed their families while they look for a new job is “immoral”?

According to a new report  a quarter of all households don't have checking or savings accounts - relying instead on payday lenders and check cashing services with high interest and fees. The Office of the Inspector General has an interesting idea: If the Postal Service offered basic banking services - nothing fancy  just basic bill paying  check cashing and small dollar loans - then it could provide affordable financial services for underserved families  and  at the same time  shore up its own financial footing.

Wow. In this interview  JPMorgan head Jamie Dimon explains why it is so important for big banks to settle with regulators after they break the law and avoid going all the way to court. It would be really costly  he says. Well  duh. I hope the banking regulators were listening. If they are never willing to go to trial either - which sure seems to be the case - they have a lot less leverage in their settlement negotiations.

The MA Senate debate showed that this election comes down to one question: Whose side do you stand on? Gabriel Gomez proved tonight: On the issues we care about for women  seniors and the middle class  he’ll stand with Mitch McConnell and the Senate Republicans  not with the people of Massachusetts. Ed Markey will fight to level the playing field for working families of the Commonwealth and our country. I’m proud to support Ed’s campaign.

Bruce and I are celebrating our 32nd wedding anniversary today! On our first anniversary  Bruce gave me a rose – and every year since then  he’s given me one rose for each year we’ve been married. I’ve saved the petals from every flower - dried them  added spices  and put them in pretty little bags on my closet shelf. After hundreds of flowers  I have quite a collection!  Together we’ve raised two great kids  and together we spoil three terrific grandkids. For all these years  Bruce has been my best friend. I couldn’t imagine running for the Senate without him standing by my side.  Happy anniversary  Bruce! I love you.

Parliament has just voted to launch airstrikes in Syria. I am reminded of the messages I have received in recent days from my constituents who have expressed deep concern for family in Syria. I also think of our armed forces whose lives will be put in danger.   The fact of the matter is  David Cameron’s case was not convincing  lacking either credible ground troops or a plan for a diplomatic settlement. Since he first made his case for airstrikes in Syria  last Thursday  opposition has mounted; in the country  in parliament and in the Labour Party.   It is impossible to avoid the conclusion that the Prime Minister realised opposition to his ill thought-out rush to war was growing – and he needed to hold the vote before it slipped from his hands. I have argued  and will continue to do so  that we should re-double our efforts to secure a diplomatic and political end to the conflict in Syria.  British service men and women will now be in harm’s way and the loss of innocent lives is sadly almost inevitable.

Boehner: "And all we're asking for is Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid and Barack Obama to allow the Congress to vote. There is a majority of the House and the Senate in favor of this bill.

Last night I attended the lighting of the Menorah in Martin Place to celebrate the beginning of Chanukah with Rabbi Feldman of the Yeshiva Centre and Rabbi Levy of Chabad Youth NSW.  Despite being 10 metres tall  the giant Menorah was upstaged by Australia’s biggest chocolate Menorah which was carefully being eyed off by the children.   Chanukah – The Festival of Lights – is an important occasion for many in the Wentworth community and it was wonderful to see the rain hold off and so many of our friends turn up for the event.

I’m supporting Ed Miliband’s campaign to be Labour leader for two  reasons. The first and foremost reason is his vision for the Labour  Party. Ed has outlined his desire for a strong  campaigning grassroots  movement that is fully participatory. Those who became disillusioned  with Labour were aggrieved because they felt ignored  that the  leadership was not listening. Winning back this support is a crucial  step in forming a forceful and effective opposition to the coalition  government. Secondly  Ed’s vision for the country. I believe that Ed has  the best policy ideas and importantly the judgement  illustrated by his  tenure as Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change.  Furthermore  his way of communicating is inspiring  direct and  consensual  not combative – I took my friend to see Ed speak in Leeds  last week and she joined the Labour Party straight afterwards and will  vote for him in the leadership election.

At first I couldn’t believe my ears. “Jihadi John” had finally been exposed as Mohammed Emwazi  and there on our screens was this knife-wielding assassin – a frame taken from one of those nauseating videos in which he swaggers and gloats and boasts about the ways in which he has subverted all decency and cut off the heads of a string of innocent aid workers and journalists. And there in the television studio was a man who seemed intent on exculpating the terrorist.  He was called Asim Qureshi  the “research director” of a body called “Cage”  and he was determined to blame absolutely everyone except the killer himself. When Jon Snow gently asked him to condemn the murders  he started babbling indignantly about the deeds of Tony Blair and Dick Cheney.  When pressed again  he accused the newsreader of Islamophobia. When Snow – who did an excellent job – asked him again to assign blame where it lay  fully and squarely with the ghoul in Syria  he started  incredibly  to blame the UK security services.  Yes  the brutal security services had stopped Emwazi from going to Tanzania “to make a life for himself abroad”. Make a life for himself! He was going to join a terrorist group called Al-Shabaab  and at one stage tried to force himself on board a plane. This sick young terrorist – said Qureshi – was “a beautiful man  very caring  very compassionate towards others”. Tell that to the relatives who have seen him publicly behead their loved ones.  It was one of the most vomit-making TV interviews I have ever seen  and at first I simply dismissed it. Surely no one would believe such rubbish; and then I reflected – and of course I saw that Cage and other apologists are by no means idiotic. You and I can see through their lies  but there are thousands  if not millions  who are more suggestible and who are willing to see things that way. The Cage people are pandering to a section of the audience that is frighteningly large  and growing. We need collectively to demolish their myths; and to do it fast.  We need a proper security response. We need to be able to monitor these vipers nursed at the breast of the British state: their movements  their communications  and sometimes we need to be able to separate them from others who could aid and abet their plans. In so far as the Lib Dems are still being obstructive  they must be overwhelmed.  Then I am afraid that we must accept that Isil still has the charisma that goes with military victory. They have money  oil  huge tracts of land – flats and material comforts with which to bait the deluded girls from Bethnal Green  who think they are going out to meet a religious and gun-toting version of Brad Pitt. We need to come up with a way of beating them – and given the understandable public revulsion at the thought of British boots on the ground  we need to work harder at backing the Kurdish Peshmerga  and persuading the Sunni military that it is in their interests not to collaborate with the terrorists  but to drive them out.  Yet none of these solutions will be any use unless we also change the way these people are sometimes viewed  and especially by young Muslims growing up in this country  whether in London schools or anywhere else. We need to debunk these jihadists and their phoney ideology. There is nothing pure or honourable in their barbaric subculture – of rape camps  throwing gays off cliffs and burning people alive in cages.  They are not even religious: many are said to have a very sketchy knowledge of the Koran. They are hopeless hypocrites who claim to despise the West but who pathetically wear Nike trainers and daub their temples with expensive Chanel cologne (Egoiste  appropriately  the preferred aroma). Many of them are losers: twits  twerps and misfits who are hopelessly caught up in a mobile-assisted pornography of violence.  Above all  we must stop this fateful elision – encouraged by the likes of Cage – between this jihadism and Islam. The other day I pointed out that many of these young men are – according to the security services – heavy users of porn. I was astounded to be denounced  on the front page of The Guardian  by the Muslim Council of Britain. A spokeswoman said that I was somehow attacking Muslims as a whole. Why on earth would she say that? Why is the MCB effectively claiming these porn freak jihadists for mainstream Islam?  I believe – and I certainly want to believe – that this jihadi madness is rejected by the overwhelming majority of Muslims; and yes  I was dismayed by the recent BBC poll in which 27 per cent said they had “some sympathy with the motives behind” the Charlie Hebdo shootings. But  then  there was no control sample of the rest of the non-Muslim population  and I am afraid that there are plenty of non-Muslims who found the cartoons offensive  and plenty of readers of this paper who object (rather more than I would  perhaps) to needless insults to religion.  I seem to remember that Pope Francis himself was asked what he thought of the motives behind the shootings  and said: “If you swear at my mother  expect a punch.” That would put him pretty firmly  I think  in the 27 per cent. The point is that neither he  nor Telegraph readers who disliked the Charlie Hebdo cartoons  nor the overwhelming majority of Muslims would want to see that emotion – taking offence – translated into violence of any kind.  That is why it is vital to insist  time and again  on the difference between this sick jihadism and Islam; and that is why  conversely  we must do everything we can to stop the likes of Cage – and indeed the MCB – from eliding anti-jihadism with Islamophobia. You can loathe jihadists  in other words  and be perfectly sympathetic to Muslims.  It is obscene  looking at their defence of Emwazi  to think that Cage have been taking money from charities such as the Anita Roddick Foundation and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. They should stop apologising for terror  and start apologising to the victims.

RMT leadership about to show utter contempt for hard working Londoners  commuters and businesses alike by striking over tube modernisation  AGAIN! Three other unions are NOT striking. Just 30% of RMT members voted to strike!  Less than 3% of journeys now start at a ticket office. LU has made it very clear - no one who wants a job with LU will be in danger  no one is losing pay  there will be no compulsory redundancies  and there will be more staff not less out on the concourses and platforms rather than stuck behind a glass screen. And the £50 million of savings will help to keep fares down.  And yet the RMT remain hell bent on this pointless strike.

SNP announcement yesterday that we will fund 5000 new council houses if we are re-elected in May is very important. It will add to the 3300 funded in this term of office. Remember - in their last four years in office  Labour built a grand total of 6 council houses. We have made so much progress since then - we need to protect it and build on it.

I was saddened to learn of the death this morning of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.  Mrs Thatcher was a formidable political leader who had a significant impact on British  European and world politics. During her eleven years as Prime Minister  she defined an era in British public life.  While her period of office came at a challenging time for British-Irish relations  when the violent conflict in Northern Ireland was at its peak  Mrs Thatcher signed the Anglo-Irish Agreement which laid the foundation for improved North-South cooperation and ultimately the Good Friday Agreement.  I extend my deepest sympathies to her family and the Prime Minister David Cameron.    https://www.finegael.ie/latest-news/2013/statement-by-the-taoiseac-1/index.xml	HER	link	94.88	73.73	42.34	82.57	21.00	29.37	3.97	0.79	0.00	0.79	0.00	2.38	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.79	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	3.17	2.38	6.35	0.79	0.00	0.00	0.79	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00

This was a very good week in terms of the growth of Ireland’s digital economy  but also one in which we were reminded again of our relative fragility.  It is undeniable that yesterday’s announcement of 450 new jobs by American multinational eBay in Dundalk represents a really wonderful opportunity for the northeast. eBay is already a significant employer in Ireland with a workforce of 2 300 across three operation centres  and it is very encouraging that Ireland has been chosen as a centre of excellence for customer service.   http://finegael.newsweaver.com/Flyer/1sypvqcz25u	HER	link	90.57	62.28	29.15	97.42	24.00	32.29	5.21	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	1.04	2.08	0.00	0.00	1.04	3.12	1.04	1.04	2.08	0.00	0.00	1.04	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00

The Action Plan for Jobs  together with ‘Pathways to Work’  is central to our strategy for economic recovery  and puts in place a comprehensive framework to deliver 270 different actions and reforms across Government and the public sector  and  in partnership with industry  to improve the enterprise environment and bring about sustainable economic growth.   The delivery rate of 92%  or 249 of these 270 actions to date  though obviously not perfect  is a demonstration of the strong commitment this Government has to tackling what remains the country’s biggest challenge.  And we are constantly mindful of the scale of that challenge. Our unemployment rate remains unacceptably high at 14.6% and the country still has a long way to go before it will emerge from this crisis. But emerge it will.  http://finegael.newsweaver.com/Flyer/vbf80x4oxup	HER	link	94.16	61.58	81.91	79.41	22.67	30.88	3.68	0.74	0.00	0.00	0.00	2.21	0.00	0.00	0.74	2.21	3.68	0.00	0.00	0.00	3.68	5.15	4.41	0.74	0.74	0.00	0.74	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00
Statement by Taoiseach Enda Kenny following the shooting dead of Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe  It was with deep shock and great sadness that I learned last night of the shooting dead in the line of duty of Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe.  This was an outrageous act of cold blooded violence that has left a family without a husband and father and the Garda Siochana without a brave and valued member.  On behalf of the Government and of the people I would like to express my condolences to Adrian's wife and children and to all his extended family at this unbearably sad time.  I would also like to express my deepest sympathies to Commissioner Martin Callinan and all of Adrian's colleagues in An Garda Siochana who I know will spare no effort in bringing to justice those responsible for this appalling crime.

Sky is already employing 450 people here in Ireland in its customer-service centre and within six months will increase that to 800 people.  In an ever shrinking world  companies like Sky are at the forefront of connecting people and cultures. The television  information and communication services provided by companies like Sky have transformed how we learn  communicate and share information. It is an industry always on the move  working on the next innovation and expanding their reach across the world.  I would like to thank JD Buckley for his invitation to join you today and would like to congratulate him and all the staff for the expansion of Sky’s footprint in Ireland.

As Taoiseach and as a proud Irishman I’m ambitious not only for my country but for our Union.    I’m determined Ireland’s success-story will be Europe’s success-story. Our resurgence achieved with and through and for this united  generous European family.      I’m determined  too  our economic  emigrants will come home. Home to an Ireland restored renewed economically.  But equally an Ireland convinced confident  that its true abiding value is alive sacrosanct in the proud territory of our people in the transforming currency of the Irish heart  imagination  soul.  Our peaceful Europe rose from the ashes of war. One of Germany’s noble laureates  Heinrich Bohl wrote of an Ireland before the European Union in his wonderful book Irisches Tagebuch.    One of Ireland’s Nobel laureates Seamus Heaney wrote in his famous poem written to mark the enlargement of the European Union – Beacons at Bealtaine – of Fionn Uisce  of clear waters that will flow from courageous leadership.  Leading to a prosperous Europe  built on hope  heart  diversity  respect  generosity   love.  That would be our true ‘Victory’.

In recent days  I have been thinking a lot about Michael Collins. Wondering about his private thoughts  his personal preoccupations  on those lonely  and lonelier journeys by mail boat and train to and from London. A young man with a young man’s hopes and dreams  but with the destiny of a nation on his shoulders. Ireland and its possibilities took not just his life  but his youthful attention his very youth itself .  Therefore  as a man  a politician  blessed enough to reach almost double his age  I feel privileged  honoured to be invited here to Beal na mBlath to give this oration.  https://www.finegael.ie/in-focus/	HER	link	82.64	76.85	11.40	60.56	18.17	22.02	3.67	1.83	0.00	0.00	1.83	4.59	0.92	0.92	4.59	0.00	2.75	0.00	0.00	0.92	0.00	0.92	3.67	0.92	0.00	0.00	0.92	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00

When you were a kid  did you ever dream of having an invisible cloak?  Well  it turns out  it is not all it's cracked up to be.   Most days  as I walk in my suit down Martin Place  I am often warmly greeted by the good people of Sydney. "Good Morning  Premier!" (Along with some “constructive feedback” of course.)  Some stop to ask for selfies. No problem  there. I'm a politician. I'm not averse to selfies.  But today in Martin Place  there are very few greetings. In fact  most people lower their heads and hurry past me  desperate to avoid eye contact.   Today  instead of wearing my suit  I'm in a high vis yellow vest and red cap  selling The Big Issue.   The Big Issue isn't just a magazine... It's a great social enterprise designed to help our homeless and disadvantaged get back on their feet by doing some work.   One morning a year  for the past 6 years  I've hit the streets to try my hand at selling the magazine... and I'm struck every year by the same confronting reality of suddenly becoming invisible.   It isn't fun being invisible. In fact  it is really lonely.   I don't write this to make you feel bad. I've done it all too often myself. I've lowered my head instead of greeting my fellow humans with a smile. I've been too busy to stop. I've felt embarrassed. I’ve felt inconvenienced. Even annoyed.  Today is a reminder for me to slow down a little. To have time for everyone  regardless of their attire or status. And it's a reminder that our homeless shouldn't be invisible.   We’re spending a record $182 million this year on specialist homelessness services and are expecting to assist 54 000 people. We have a long way to go. But I'm determined to make a difference in the lives of our most vulnerable.   Thanks to the 11 people who stopped today to buy a copy of The Big Issue. And thanks also to those who just stopped to smile and say hello... Scotty  my mate who sells the Big Issue every week  really appreciates it.   He's a really good bloke who  along with many others  is trying to have a crack at getting back on his feet.  And he shouldn't be invisible.

HSC exams begin tomorrow.   Back when I was in school  a typical report card said something like "Mike talks too much in class."  Truth be told  I was much more interested in catching waves (and girls) than studying... and my HSC results were average at best.  Not too long after my school days were over  I met Kerryn on a beach down the south coast... And school was suddenly a distant memory!  Here's the truth of it... Life isn't defined by your exams. It begins after they are finished.   It's always important to give everything you do your very best shot  but make sure you keep some perspective. When you walk out of that final exam  you've got the world at your feet... And most of us oldies will tell you that your best days are yet to come.   Good luck guys.

Politics can be brutal.   What can be lost in the rough and tumble is the people  and the relationships.   I’ve known Tony Abbott for close to 15 years and I am proud to call him a mate. He will be hurting. So will his wonderful wife Margie and his girls. As their friend  I hurt with them.    Many of those throwing stones don’t see the heart behind the man who has spent decades volunteering at the local surf club or working a shift with the Rural Fire Service… not for political gain  but for the simple reason that he loves his community.   This desire to serve  mixed with a deep love of Australia  took him into politics  and ultimately to the highest elected office in the land. Not once have I sensed it was due to a thirst for power. Rather  he has an unquenchable desire to give back. This has always been grounded in a deep humility.   I do look forward to working closely with Malcolm. He will lead with distinction and I anticipate great things for Australia.   But right now  I say to Tony… thanks for always putting your hand up to serve. Thanks for loving your country.  And thanks for being a good mate.

Following consultation with the families of Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson  removal of the floral tribute in Martin Place will begin from tomorrow afternoon ahead of forecast wet weather.  This will allow for all notes  messages and cards to be preserved.  Flowers will be clean mulched for future use at a site to be determined in consultation with the families. At an appropriate time we'll also discuss with them the establishment of a permanent memorial.  An online condolence book can still be signed at http://tribute.dpc.nsw.gov.au/remembering-the-victims-of-the-lindt-cafe-siege/   Thank you to everyone who has contributed to the floral memorial.

This morning I come before you with the heaviest of hearts.  Unbelievably  overnight we have lost a number of our own citizens  in an attack we thought we’d never see here in our city.  But the values we held dear yesterday we hold dear today. They are the values of freedom  democracy and harmony.  These defined us yesterday. They define us today. They will define us tomorrow.  Our first thoughts and prayers this morning are with the innocent victims their families and friends of this vicious  horrendous attack.  I want to say to their family and friends  everyone in NSW stands beside you. This morning. Tomorrow. Forever.  I pay tribute to the men and women of the NSW Police who have saved many many lives over the past day and have risked their lives in doing so. I also want to pay tribute to all other emergency service workers and authorities who have provided vital assistance.  My thoughts remain with those hostages who have been freed. Every care they need at this traumatic time will be made available to them.  We are a peaceful  harmonious society which is the envy of the world.  How we react in coming days will show who we are. We will come through this.  Today  while we grieve  we must go about our usual lives -- we work  we talk to our families  neighbours and friends.  And I say to everyone… today we must come together like never before. We are stronger together. We will get through this together.

Thanks for feedback on new hospital announcement - it is exciting that this level of health facility is finally coming to the Northern Beaches! Confirming that patients will be treated in the new hospital under the public health system as normal - private operators will manage it for the Government under a contract. A new model that's shown to be a win-win in WA. Reassuring all that the Manly hospital land will not be sold off to developers. As I said during the election campaign  there will be broad community consultation on how the land will be used. My strong preference is for aged care. Interested in your views. Happy to answer any more questions you have - or feel free to call my office on 9976 2773.

WORLD CLASS HOSPITAL FOR NORTHERN BEACHES  Health Minister Jillian Skinner today announced expressions of interest will be invited from the private sector to design  construct  operate and maintain a world-class hospital on Sydney’s Northern Beaches.  For many years there has been talk of a new hospital. Today it is clear that the hospital is a reality  and that people on the Northern Beaches will have access to a full range of medical services.  The Northern Beaches Hospital is the first major investment in public health infrastructure on the Northern Beaches for decades  demonstrating yet again that the NSW Government is getting on with the job of renewing infrastructure across our great state.

I just finished Michael McCaul's new book  "Failures of Imagination " and I highly recommend it to anyone who is as concerned as I am about the threats facing our nation. Rep.

Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus has led a remarkable revolution that has set a new standard for the nominating debates. His efforts have shifted the control and definition of debates from the news media to the political party for the first time since the rise of television networks  and now it's time for the Commission on Presidential Debates to follow his lead and create the same level of change in the general election debates. http://bit.ly/1K1CJIc	LER	link	99.00	64.46	26.79	72.05	27.00	29.63	2.47	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	1.23	7.41	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	1.23	0.00	1.23	4.94	8.64	0.00	0.00	0.00	1.23	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00

Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich charged President Barack Obama with pulling an “election-year gimmick” in an exclusive interview with Newsmax.TV shortly after the administration announced a major shift in its immigration policy.   “I think it’s very strange ” Gingrich countered after the Department of Homeland Security issued a policy change on Friday that essentially amounts to amnesty for the children of illegal immigrants. “If the president has the power to do that  why didn’t he do it three years ago? And if he can do it for people under 16  can he do it for everybody?”	HER	link	82.23	63.16	13.15	6.82	23.80	28.57	0.84	2.52	0.00	1.68	0.00	0.84	1.68	1.68	1.68	0.84	2.52	0.84	0.84	0.00	0.00	0.00	7.56	0.00	0.84	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	1.68	0.00

Two more years of high unemployment is a status quo we can't afford to accept. We can do better than this.   Yet with the economy faltering and these millions out of work  President Obama has nothing to offer. He has no plan to help get the economy growing again. He has no ideas to create jobs. His initiatives are largely rhetorical.   His model for job-creation has been miserably inadequate from the start  because it relied on the government to fund particular projects and companies -- regardless of their merit. That model can succeed in spending a lot of money  but with 12.7 million people out of work  it's far too narrow to make a dent in the unemployment problem.   There are only so many green energy companies to throw taxpayer money at. There are only so many bridges to visit for a photo op.

...for all the President's promises of millions of "green jobs " few have appeared. The White House claimed its "investment" in Solyndra would create 4 000 jobs  but at its height  the company employed just 585 people -- and then it went bankrupt. The cost? Almost $1 million per temporary job.  The $34 billion Obama has spent on his loan guarantee program for green energy startups exceeds the GDPs of 104 of the world's countries  but the sources he's focusing on account for only a tiny fraction of America's energy production  and they're still not cost-competitive.

In addition to revoking the leases for oil shale development in the American west  in just four years he has:  •Obstructed new drilling offshore  where only 2.2 percent of federal land is currently being leased for production.  •Killed the Keystone XL pipeline to transport Canadian oil to the United States  where it could be refined in our refineries and sold in our gas stations.  •Proposed tens of billions of dollars in new taxes on oil producers every single year in his budget.  •Demonized energy producers and lambasted “tax breaks for oil companies” which in reality apply to all U.S. manufacturers.  •Harassed oil and gas companies in North Dakota with trumped-up charges under the 1918 Migratory Bird Act.  •Attempted to institute massive new carbon taxes by dictate  allowing the EPA to classify carbon dioxide as a pollutant—even after Congress directly rejected his cap-and-tax scheme.

Dear Facebook Friend   This has been a tumultuous quarter  with its fair share of highs and lows. The media is less than thrilled with the idea of an experienced conservative systematically dismantling the failed liberal policies that they champion. This election is a historic clash of ideology  and if the ideals of liberty are going to carry the argument  our nominee must not timidly pull his punches. I am prepared to challenge every radical policy  every radical appointment  and every radical idea of the Obama administration  and I will not shy away from exposing the worst President in American history.   Today we have an opportunity to strike a blow to the Democrats' media machine by disproving the ridiculous narrative that this campaign does not have the resources to compete. My staff has informed me that we are now less than $500 000 from reaching $10 million raised in the fourth quarter. Surpassing ten million would be an incredible achievement and with your help I know we can do it!   I am proud of how we have run this campaign  and am confident that with the help of thousands of supporters around the country we can surpass the $10 million mark. As an extra bonus  everyone who contributes $100 or more will receive special recognition in our New Year's Day email!

I just think he's got the best economic plan of any of the candidates.  I love the idea that he wants a strong dollar--that was clearly Reagan all the way.  An optional flat tax  that’s wonderful.

I've never seen a bigger mess than the Congress and the President passing a pathetic two-month tax extension at a time when we desperately need an economic growth and jobs plan.  Because if Europe gets in trouble this Spring  and we're not growing  you're going to see the whole world economy drug deeper into this deep recession.

By now you've likely heard that our effort to gain access to the primary ballot in Virginia was not successful.  This was not due to a lack of effort by our volunteers  but the cumbersome process in Virginia.    We are exploring alternate methods to compete in Virginia - stay tuned.  Going forward  we will be as in-front of the process as possible and with the help of our grassroots volunteers we will make all other deadlines.  Newt and I have talked three or four times today and he stated that this is not catastrophic - we will continue to learn and grow.  Remember that it was only a few months ago that pundits and the press declared us dead after the paid consultants left.  They declared that the decision not to compete in the Ames Straw Poll would mean that Iowans would ignore us.  Some will again state that this is fatal.    Newt and I agreed that the analogy is December 1941: We have experienced an unexpected set-back  but we will re-group and re-focus with increased determination  commitment and positive action.  Throughout the next months there will be ups and downs; there will be successes and failures; there will be easy victories and difficult days - but in the end we will stand victorious.    To help achieve that outcome we each need to spend the next 24 hours enjoying our families and friends as much as possible.  Enjoy their company.  Be grateful for them.  Gather strength from them.  The promise of a better future for our family and friends is the reason we are committed to rebuilding the America we love.    May the spirit of the season fill each of you.  Merry Christmas.

We fought the entire Second World War from December 7th 1941 to victory over Japan in August of 1945.  It is three years and eight months.  In forty-four months  we defeat Nazi German  Fascist Italy  and Imperial Japan.  It recently took twenty-three years to add a fifth runway to the Atlanta airport.  This is all humanly created incompetence.   We need a long-term plan for jobs and economic growth  not short two-month Band-Aids.  We must move now to cut taxes  reduce regulations  fully utilize America's energy resources and take steps to stabilize the value of the dollar.   As Speaker  we cut taxes  put in the largest capital gains tax cut in history  we cut regulations  we strengthened American energy  and we worked with the people who create jobs. Not only did we balance the budget for four straight years while paying off $405 billion in debt—11 million new jobs were created.  So  we know it works. – Newt Gingrich  Take the time this holiday weekend to watch and ‘Share’ this town hall meeting where Newt answers some very tough questions from the audience.

I want all of you to think about how serious this is:  A movement [radical Islam] which recruits its own children to learn how to be suicide bombers and sends them into a bus station  or into a mall  or into a restaurant to blow themselves up in order to kill you is a movement which with nuclear weapons would use them in a heartbeat because there is no effective deterrent.

Reagan believed the power of truth restated the world and reframed the world.  I'm a Reaganite.  I'm proud to be a Reaganite.

WOLF: Obama supporters  Democrats  White House officials  Obama campaign officials say they look forward to running against you.  They’re nervous about Mitt Romney.    NEWT:  I remember in 1966  Governor Pat Brown  Jerry Brown’s father  was really concerned about a moderate Mayor of San Francisco named George Christopher.  He really wanted to find some right-wing actor that he could beat easily.  They were thrilled that Ronald Reagan was running.  Reagan beat him by a million votes.    I am perfectly happy for the Obama people to decide that they want to beat up on Romney.  It’s a little tough on Romney  but that’s fine with me.  When we get to the general election  if I’m the nominee  after the president has those seven  three-hour debates  we’ll see how they feel about it.  ‘Like’ if you agree with Newt.  ‘Share’ this informative  in-depth interview.  http://youtu.be/0I2S__oEGXE	HER	video	71.42	76.68	11.86	95.22	12.58	17.22	5.30	0.66	0.66	0.00	0.00	3.31	0.66	3.31	1.99	0.66	3.97	2.65	0.66	0.66	1.99	2.65	5.96	1.32	0.00	0.00	0.66	0.66	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00
I am very  very worried about our entire relationship with radical Islam because it’s based on a pack of lies.  It’s based on a pack of self-deception.  It’s based on a state department that is consistently engaged in appeasement.  It is an act of dishonesty to the American people.  The fact that the justice department has said all of its training programs on terrorism have to take out the word Islam is an outrageous denial of truth. – Newt Gingrich  ‘Like’ if you agree with Newt.  ‘Share’ this important in-depth video that outlines how a Gingrich Administration will protect America’s relationship to its ally  Israel.  http://www.newt.org/news/video-newt-speaks-republican-jewish-coalition-presidential-candidate-forum	HER	link	92.00	81.84	1.24	25.77	15.12	23.97	4.13	4.13	1.65	1.65	0.00	0.00	4.13	0.83	0.83	3.31	0.83	1.65	1.65	0.00	4.13	0.00	4.13	0.83	0.83	0.00	0.83	0.83	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00
The Founding Fathers wanted to avoid dictatorship.  And they designed a machine so inefficient that no dictator could force it to work. You have the House  the Senate  the President  the Supreme Court-we can barely get it to work voluntarily.

My favorite Founding Father is George Washington because all of us stand on his shoulders.  Without George Washington there would have been no America  without his dignity  his honor  his patriotism  and his endurance.  He was in the field for eight years.  He returned to Mt.

"I think this Super Committee is about as dumb an idea as Washington has come up with in my lifetime." - Newt Gingrich  In the summer of 2011  the Washington establishment pinned its hopes on a so-called 'Super Committee' of 12 Congressmen and Senators to solve America's deficit and spending problems.

I think that it is astonishing that the Obama administration has now filed lawsuits on immigration against Arizona  Alabama  and South Carolina.  And  they have accepted foreign governments in the lawsuits.  The whole purpose of creating the Constitution was to bind together the States so that foreign powers could not play us off each other  and the Founding Fathers were very worried about foreign governments getting in the habit of playing us off each other.

I hope you will join me at one of these stops and join my campaign to bring real leadership to Washington  prosperity to American workers  security to our nations seniors and to lead a revival of our national conscience.  The race in South Carolina remains wide open. Over 2/3 of South Carolina voters -- just like Iowa -- remain undecided on whom to support and our campaign is heating up at the right moment.  That means we can not only win Iowa and South Carolina  we can win the White House and change the course of our nation.  I hope to see you at one of these events.

Iowa: On the campaign trail  many people ask me why pass the FairTax? My answer is simple: Our current system is backwards. Why do we punish hard work and income? Why does our tax system reward irresponsibility? By taxing sales instead of income  we encourage productivity and savings  which will jump-start our economy. Americans also spend more than $500 billion complying with our tax code each year. This is an inefficient waste of time  energy and money.

For too long American families and workers have been pushed aside while self aggrandizing Washington DC politicians feign leadership and offer only political theater and flowery speeches. For too long an out of control judiciary has forced their compromised values on Americans of faith and American seniors have had to live in fear of politicians stealing from Social Security. For too long  we have watched our nation’s security erode  withered by political correctness and liberal ideology.  It’s time we take our nation back.

I've been talking a lot about the FairTax today and I wanted to address how it impacts seniors and Social Security.   The FairTax “senior bonus payment" gives every senior a monthly check to offset any new taxes they face. By eliminating payroll taxes and ensuring everyone pays taxes  it also creates a more stable  reliable funding stream for Social Security. The FairTax protects and preserves Social Security and Medicare by jump-starting our economy and ensuring everyone pays into the system.  Keeping the government's promises to seniors is so critical to me so please keep this in mind as you hear me and other GOP candidates for President talk about tax reform in the days and weeks ahead.

My wife Janet and I are privileged to consider Sean and Sandy Parnell our friends of many years.  Governor Parnell has been a rock solid conservative for Alaska and is one of the strongest pro life governors in the country.  The Juneau Empire reported that  if legislation on marriage equality or abortion rights comes to the desk when Bill Walker is Governor  he said:  “We’ll make that decision at that time. I can’t guarantee how I will decide on a bill that comes across our desk.”  You don’t have to wonder where Governor Parnell stands on life.  Supporting traditional marriage and protecting the unborn are foundational issues.  Governor Parnell’s record has earned him the support of National Right to Life and the Alaska Family Council.  I hope you will join me in supporting Sean Parnell for reelection as Governor.  Please visit www.Parnell2014.com to volunteer  make a generous contribution or learn more.

Hawaii  each day I thank God for your freedom and for the men and women in uniform who provided it. I have a good friend  Martha Cothren  a social studies teacher at Joe T. Robinson High School  in Little Rock. Her father was a WWII POW  and she is a true patriot. On the first day of school in 2005  Martha wanted to give her students a lesson on freedom they wouldn’t forget. With the permission of her principal  she removed the desks from her classroom. When the students came for first period and asked where their desks were  Martha told them they would get a desk when they could tell her how to earn one. Students suggested good grades  or good behavior  but Martha told them while those were important  it would not earn them a desk. As each period came and went  students were stumped as to how to earn a desk and word spread across campus about the teacher who had lost her mind and taken the desks out. Students called their parents  some called the media and local television crews showed up to find out what was going on. At the last period of the school day  when no student had correctly answered how to earn a desk  Martha Cothren went to the classroom door and opened it  and welcomed a parade of veterans who walked in carrying school desks. As they brought in the desks and lined them in rows  Martha told them  “Kids  you don’t have to earn your desks; these guys already did.” I salute great teachers and patriots across our land who honor our veterans. And most of all  I salute our veterans  who earned me more than a school desk. They earned me my freedom. To them  I say thanks. And God bless you!

New Mexico  we should be interested in helping the people of other nations experience the fruits of freedom and free enterprise. If they wish to come to America  we should welcome them when they come through the same legal process that we would have to go through to go to their countries.

Attention Michigan:  Huck PAC and I are proud to endorse Gary Glenn for Michigan State Representative. Gary Glenn  I first met Gary six years ago  and the more I've learned about his life's work  the more impressed I am at his knowledge and experience on a wide array of issues. Gary has been a nationally recognized leader on labor law reform  free market healthcare reform  School Choice  and defense of commonly-shared community values such as protecting prenatal life and traditional marriage.  Gary Glenn has a life-long track record of actually getting things done for our conservative values and principles. He is recognized as a strong pro-life leader in Michigan  and supports the 2nd Amendment. Gary was one of two coauthors of Michigan's Marriage Protection Amendment and as a state representative he will sponsor legislation for a state Fair Tax.  I hope you will join the Huck PAC family and me in supporting Gary Glenn for Michigan State Representative at the polls on August 5th.

In fact  both rulings  though conflicting  highlight the fact that Obamacare was a poorly-written takeover of people's healthcare and an ill-conceived law that would be enforced by a scandal-plagued IRS.

Huck PAC and I first endorsed Chuck Fleischmann for Congress in 2010  when he made his first try at elective office.  Chuck won election then and was reelected in 2012.

Chuck is passionately pro-life and has voted for the ban on partial-birth abortions as well as voting in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood.  He also is a strong opponent of Obamacare and has voted to protect the Second Amendment at every opportunity.  In fact  Chuck has a 100% pro-life and 2nd Amendment voting record.  Chuck is a fiscal conservative as well as being a social conservative.  He has voted to cut $1.6 trillion from the federal budget and supports a balanced budget amendment.

STATEMENT - NELSON MANDELA  On behalf of the Federal Opposition  we pay tribute to Nelson Mandela  unarguably one of the greatest global figures of our time.   Today we have lost a light of our world.   In fractious and troubled times  Mandela led his nation out of the dark age of apartheid – not with a violent struggle  but with peace  compassion and a force of moral leadership.   Mandela knew his country could never be healed with violence or vengeance. He suffered so his people could be free.   Mandela was a true leader  a statesman  and the defining symbol of reconciliation.   He achieved perhaps more than any other leader in his pursuit of peace  acceptance and justice.   The slow struggle for reconciliation does not end today – not for South Africa  and not for any of us.   Let today renew our resolve for reconciliation. Mandela was an example to the world – we must live by that example.   Our thoughts and prayers are with his family  his country  and all who looked to him in hope for a better world.   We are better because of Mandela. May he rest in peace.   LABOR LEADER  THE HON. BILL SHORTEN MP DEPUTY LABOR LEADER  THE HON.

I was deeply saddened to hear of the sudden and tragic death of Lesley Hall.   Lesley was a passionate and persistent advocate for people with a disability and played a decisive role in the campaign for a national disability insurance scheme.   Lesley led Australian Federation of Disability Organisation (AFDO) during a period of immense change for people with a disability in Australia and was a tireless advocate for inclusive and empowering public policy.   Lesley will be missed by all those who loved and worked with her  but we can all learn from the woman who never  never gave up.
